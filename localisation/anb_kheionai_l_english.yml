 kheionai.0.t:0 "The Death Winds"
 kheionai.0.d:0 "A rural mother tucks her children into bed and makes them recite their evacuation plans, the same as her mother made her do before her first Death Wind. A sailor out to sea holds his head in his hands, knowing he's too far out to sea to return home, and the magical tumors will ensure he never sees his wife again. A philosopher on Alecand stares at the hateful blue dust clouds on the horizon, content the purpose-built architecture and magical Windwards will protect him and his kheion.\n\nOverexposure to any kind of suffering will numb you to it. That's what the Kheionai tell themselves. You can only cower in fear for so long. And the Kheionai have lived in the Death Wind's malignant shadow for as long as there have been Kheionai: a great storm of poisonous blue sand from the Kaydhano Sea, carrying wicked magic that inflicts lethal cancers upon all exposed. It cannot be avoided. It cannot be stopped. All you can do is hope you can seek shelter in time. Life grinds to a halt as the Death Winds strip the soil and mutilate flesh. It suffocates a nation like a smothered infant.\n\nThe Kheionai have learned how to prepare for the inevitable as best they can. There simply isn't any other choice. So long as the Kheionai maintain their fragile Windwards, their young civilization may yet survive."
 kheionai.0.a:0 "The mages predict the next storm in one year."

 kheionai.1:0 "Death Wind"
 kheionai.1.t:0 "The Azure Death Comes"
 kheionai.1.d:0 "Word comes from the north, carried by the brave and foolhardy who venture those waters - the Kaydhano stirs. The winds again sweep that great poisoned waste, stirring the desert’s life-stealing sands, and soon enough they will whip south to ravage Alecand. Already the news spreads like wildfire throughout the kheions and into the countryside, and those who dare to live beyond the Windwards are making preparations to move into the cities to weather the storms. Over the coming weeks, all life begins to revolve around preparation for the Death Winds, and normal economic activity slows down as people focus on surviving the worst."
 kheionai.1.a:0 "The Death Wind will be upon us soon."

 kheionai.4.d:0 "Helper Event"
 kheionai.4.a:0 "Okay"

 kheionai.5.t:0 "Windwards Sabotaged!"
 kheionai.5.d:0 "The Windwards that surround the kheions are durable and mighty, capable of withstanding some of the most devastating physical and magical bombardments of Halann. They are also, to those who understand them, very fragile, and the removal or damage of just one or two components can defeat their protective measures and leave large sections of a kheion unwarded.\n\nBecause of their value and vulnerability, the windwards are always a target. Recently, our soldiers have captured saboteurs attempting to damage our protections! We presume they have been sent by our rivals to ensure we are weakened by the deathwinds when next they come - we will have to deal with them in force to punish them for such an underhanded and duplicitous trespass."
 kheionai.5.a:0 "Bastards!"

 kheionai.6.t:0 "A New People?"
 kheionai.6.d:0 "For years now we have lost the ties to our Alecandi overlords, as time passes people change and some no longer consider us to be the same as our cousins that never left the island."

 kheionai.6.b:0 "We are still of the blood of Alecand!"

 kheionai.7.t:0 "Temporary Ward Damage Removed"
 kheionai.7.d:0 "Helper Event"
 kheionai.7.a:0 "Okay."

 kheionai.8.t:0 "The Quiet After the Storm"
 kheionai.8.d:0 "After many years the Deathwinds have subsided, the great winds shifting away from the northeast and carrying only the smell of sea salt and mountain air on the breeze. A week of rejoicing reigns in the kheions, folk from all walks of life celebrating another ordeal endured. Slowly the people begin to trickle out of the cities - returning to farms and outlying fields to rebuild, boarding ships as envoys, fishermen, or traders, or even wandering simply for the sake of leaving the confines in which they have been so long imprisoned. Life returns to normal - as normal as it is in Alecand - for a time, and we would do well to seize this opportunity to look beyond our borders again."
 kheionai.8.a:0 "The Death Wind is over."

 kheionai.9.t:0 "The Storm"
 kheionai.9.d:0 "As always, it came upon the land slowly, the winds shifting to blow from the northeast. The first winds whisked along small flecks of blue, little more than a whisper of doom to the untrained eye. But the first flecks were followed soon after by ever more intense winds carrying azure death, the poison sands blighting the ground and spreading sickness wherever they land, the air itself becoming a herald of cancer and contagion. The terrible days have come again to Alecand, those winds of death ready to wipe the land clean and steal the lives of any not sheltered behind the Windwards. The cities are filled to bursting with refugees, the granaries are stocked full and rationed tightly as we wait out the Kaydhano’s wrath."
 kheionai.9.a:0 "The Death Wind is here."

 kheionai.12.t: "Cultural Drift In Devand"
 kheionai.12.d: "While settling the interior of Devand, the settlers have come to grow distant from their parent cities, developing new traditions and customs separate from those of Alecand. These peoples now identify more strongly with their nékhei than the parent city that may rule over them. From now on, this distinction means the Kheionai of Devand can no longer be called the same as they were before."
 kheionai.12.a: "We forge our own path now!"

 kheionai.14.t: "Cultural Drift In Devand"
 kheionai.14.d: "While settling the interior of Devand, the settlers have come to grow distant from their parent cities, developing new traditions and customs separate from those of Alecand. These peoples now identify more strongly with their nékhei than the parent city that may rule over them. From now on, this distinction means the Kheionai of Devand can no longer be called the same as they were before."
 kheionai.14.a: "As long as they still bend the knee"

 kheionai.16.t: "Growth of our Nékheis"
 kheionai.16.d: "Due to the steady growth of our nékheis, we are now able to pull more trade from them and the mainland for us."
 kheionai.16.a: "Let's hope they don't get any ideas"

 kheionai.17.t: "Growth of our Country"
 kheionai.17.d: "Due to our steady growth we are now able to put more resources into our colonization efforts, while our Alecandi overlord reaps more benefits to their trade."
 kheionai.17.a: "Perhaps it's time to forge our own path..."

 kheionai.18.t: "A New Subject"
 kheionai.18.desc: "While we were expanding we managed to get control over a country, what should we do with it?"
 kheionai.18.a: "Proclaim them our vassal"
 kheionai.18.b: "Let them keep some of their autonomy"
 kheionai.18.c: "Free them, they're not worth the effort"
 kheionai.18.dd: "Integrate them into our other Nékheis"

 kheionai.19.t: "[From.GetName] Requests War Rights"
 kheionai.19.d: "Today our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] got a letter from [From.GetName] requesting the right to go to war. While this would help our colonization of the mainland, it will also hurt our trade until the war has finished and if they get too big they might start thinking about independence."
 kheionai.19.a: "Grant War Rights"
 kheionai.19.b: "Refuse the Request"

 kheionai.20.t: "War Rights Granted"
 kheionai.20.d: "Our diplomat has come back to us with great news, [From.GetName] has accepted our request for war rights! We can now declare one war for the next 5 years."
 kheionai.20.a: "Prepare the Troops!"

 kheionai.21.t: "War Rights Denied"
 kheionai.21.d: "Our diplomat has come back to us with bad news, [From.GetName] has refused our request for war rights!"

 # events
 
 kheionai_flavour.1.t:0 "The Hounds of Askóvoinos"
 kheionai_flavour.1.d:0 "Though the wealth of Kimanis has long been sourced from its silk rather than its wine, they still have a proud winemaking heritage – every year, when a new vintage is brought in to the Kheion, the Kimabhen hold the “Askóvoinos Festival”, a grand celebration with much theatre, feasting, and, naturally, the drinking of diluted Askóvoinos wine, as is the Kheionai’s custom. But for as long as the Kimabhen have drunk diluted wine, there have been salacious rumours of underground cults that indulge in the drink at its full strength and in great quantity – they are rumours, of course, but they seem the most obvious culprit for what has recently transpired.\n\nIt started as a normal festival, the feasting tables, arrayed through the city, full of Kimabhen citizens, eagerly indulging in the meat and wine doled out so freely. But the drink was stronger than usual – only after much of the Kimabhen mob were deep in their cups was it realised that someone had swapped the diluted wine for the undiluted wine. The Kimabhen mob is accustomed to being pulled to and fro by populist, nativist demagogues – when drunk, they can be pulled to any extreme one desires. When the first cries of grievance against [Root.GetName] began to ring through the city, the garrison’s fate was sealed. The Hounds of Askóvoinos were unleashed, and Kimanis gave itself to madness.\n\nThe Kimabhen, quite literally, tore our troops apart in the streets. Now, even as they recover from what must be the mother of all hangovers, they have already made plans for independence, seizing the city’s armoury and outfitting every willing citizen they can find. The Kimánis Revolt has begun – now, we must reclaim our wayward territory!"
 kheionai_flavour.1.a:0 "Destroy the drunken upstarts!"
 kheionai_flavour.1.b:0 "Kimábhen liberty will not be crushed!"
 
 kheionai_flavour.2.t: "Kimanis Calls for Aid"
 kheionai_flavour.2.d: "The Hounds of Askóvoinos run rabid through the streets of the city of silk, as the Kimabhen throw off their oppressors! But the tide is turning against them even now. Kimanis calls for aid..."
 kheionai_flavour.2.a: "And this Kheion will answer!"
 kheionai_flavour.2.b: "But where was Kimanis when Empkeios fell?"

 kheionai_flavour.3.t:0 "Kheionai Left Behind"
 kheionai_flavour.3.d:0 "When the Kaydhano stirs, the islands of Anisídhan are the first to notice – the arrival of a fleet of ships bearing Anisídhan’s population in Arpedifér heralds a wave of activity across Alecand, as the Kheionai prepare to endure what would break most other societies. Sometimes, Anisídhan notices too late, and their hurried escape leaves the people of Alecand less time to make it to the Kheions – should our prognosticators also fail to predict the Kaydhano through other means, the results can be disastrous.\n\nUnfortunately, this worst case scenario has come true. Our people have been rushing to the safety of [Root.Capital.GetName] – but it seems that not all may make it in time. One of the strongest taboos in Kheionai culture is to deny someone shelter in a Kaydhano – but it was not so long ago that, during the Slave Revolt, the city of Kimanis was left devastated as a small gap in the city’s ward allowed the Kaydhano to lash at the streets below. Tens of thousands died – surely we cannot risk such a thing again?\n\nThe news that a large train of people from the edge of our territory is rushing to our gates – and is predicted to arrive just as the Kaydhano does as well – has brought that question to the fore once more. Our decision may have grave consequences…"
 kheionai_flavour.3.a: "Let them in, quickly!"
 kheionai_flavour.3.b: "We can't risk opening the ward."

 kheionai_flavour.4.t: "Was it Worth it?"
 kheionai_flavour.4.d:0 "The aftermath of a Kaydhano has become rote for the Kheionai. Wait for the Kaydhano sand’s lethality to diminish, sending out abjuration-protected workers if that does not work, clear the roads leading out of the Kheion, then return those who had come from out of town back to their homes, as quickly and efficiently as possible.\n\nThey found the bodies in that second stage, as a group of sand-clearers stumbled on a cave they had claimed as their shelter. As the wall of death drew perilously close, they had been turned away, the train of people and the goods they brought with them deemed too large to process in time – though they had sought shelter underground, they had already been exposed to the winds for too long.\n\nThe news has spread quickly through our people, and they are not happy. All over, people speak of the mothers dying with their children in their arms, the children of [Root.Capital.GetName] abandoned by their state, and they say that it is our misjudgement that killed them. Already, the mob demands the fall of our government, as they besiege our capital’s Oúraskheion – if we do not put down this revolution soon, they may get what they want."
 kheionai_flavour.4.a: "We did what we could."

 kheionai_flavour.5.t:0 "A Troublesome Debater"
 kheionai_flavour.5.d:0 "The Kheionai love a good debate – in fact, it is one of the foundations of their culture, the crucible in which philosophy is forged. It's just that they generally like debate in the symposium, over a few cups of wine, or in the halls of the philosophical schools, or in the assembly chamber. Most do not like to debate as they are trying to buy or sell at the market, as they are trying to relax at the baths, as they are going about their daily life and public business. Nobody – not nobody – likes debating the fundamental questions of life while sitting in the public toilets.\n\nOne philosopher, however, did not get this memo. One moment you are strolling to collect some papers from your business associate – the next, you are being ambushed with questions about the nature of life and death, or the role of magic in society, or “whether you can call a chicken an elf.” Some members of our government have been having mental breakdowns – nowhere in the Kheion is safe! And to make matters worse, he has managed to amass a cohort of people who actually like him! If we put an end to this madness, there will be some who call it an “infringement on freedom of debate.” On the other hand, it would make tending to your business – of any kind – a lot less annoying."
 kheionai_flavour.5.a:0 "Stop him immediately!"
 kheionai_flavour.5.b:0 "We have no right to interfere."
 kheionai_flavour.5.c:0 "Invite him into government!"

 kheionai_flavour.6.t:0 "Conflicting Ways of Governing"
 kheionai_flavour.6.d:0 "To the Kheionai, philosophical schools – organised teachings on both how to see the world and act within it – are the bedrock of society, government and culture. Each Kheion has been moulded by the philosophies its citizens adhere to, and that means that the interaction between different cities is analogous to the interaction of different philosophies. Normally those differences can be overcome through debate, consensus and concession – but, as is common to philosophers, there can be a tendency to entrench one’s own values in response to opposition.\n\nThis has recently happened in our Kheion’s relationship with our subjects – and unfortunately, it seems we may be to blame. Our Kylakas and their advisors’ steadfast beliefs about how government and governance should operate have resulted in complete deadlock, as much of our subjects’ local leadership now refuses to work with us, believing that as we will never give, neither should they.\n\nThere seems to be only two options available to us – either we finally retreat from our position, or we use force to impose our own will on the cities."
 kheionai_flavour.6.a:0 "Retreat from our position to appease the cities."
 kheionai_flavour.6.b:0 "We will open their eyes ourselves!"
 kheionai_flavour.6.c:0 "The resignation of our Kylakas will placate them."

 kheionai_flavour.7.t: "In the Streets and Halls"
 kheionai_flavour.7.d: "A few days ago, a simple scuffle between a group of Taychendi and [Root.Culture.GetName] merchants turned into a bloody street fight, which has  seen the Taychendi either killed or heavily wounded at the hands of a superstitious mob. This issue has not only aroused the attention of the authorities in our city but also that of our countries philosophers.\n\nEven now, shouting can be heard all across the city, as Philosophers from multiple schools and academies are arguing over this recent violence. Many of the arguments are different from school to school, however a group of Archatiradians, a school from Lokemeion who are known for expending great effort to document and understand the ways of Barbhen peoples, are outraged. They say that violence is not the way to dispute the Taychendi and other foreign peoples, and that instead you must engage them with reasoned debate to show them the error of their ways.\n\nThey are demanding our government to punish the mob that has lead to the death of several taychendi and issue an apology."
 kheionai_flavour.7.a: "Issue an apology and punish the wrongdoers"
 kheionai_flavour.7.b: "Never trust a Taychendi!"
 kheionai_flavour.7.c: "We cannot punish our people, we need to compromise"

 kheionai_flavour.8.t: "Strange thoughts of a strange man"
 kheionai_flavour.8.d: "Though known for his leadership, a former Kylakas has ended up living in a barrel. This sight brought many to question the state of our city, though as it had turned out he chose to live in that barrel. Nowadays he is known for openly preaching his way of thinking, he calls himself a ‘Ulótholist’, which is in reference to a centuries old philosopher known as ‘Ulóthopholes’ whose work is still studied to this day.\n\nThe man living in a barrel believes that to live a fully good and honest life, one must reject the material and live a life devoid of material possessions. Although crude and offensive, this man would prove to be a boon for the state and could bring with him much experience. The problem with this is however that he won’t accept employment, thus we’ll need to send advisors and bureaucrats to ‘just ask him questions’."
 kheionai_flavour.8.a: "This mastery in Philosophy shall not go to waste!"

 kheionai_flavour.9.t: "Ormabhen upstart"
 kheionai_flavour.9.d: "In a University in Ormam, one known for its expertise in studying trade and economics, has seen a specially talented class who have made a name for themselves for employing new strategies in trade and economics. Though their unorthodox strategies have made them disliked by many old fashioned traders."
 kheionai_flavour.9.a: "Run a test and hire their best student"
 kheionai_flavour.9.b: "Let the class run its course, they’ve got enough work already"

 kheionai_flavour.10.t: "A peculiar lifestyle"
 kheionai_flavour.10.d: "People in our cities seem to enjoy a more free life, free of material possessions that is. They follow Ulótholism, though not many are concerned with the original philosophical idea of Ulóthopholes and rather just enjoy what they consider a free life.\n\nWhen asked, many of these people will not be deterred by any arguments and simply go on with their day. Some have also been seen walking through the wild completely naked, though such cases are rare, it could be a bad look on the state if we keep allowing this kind of behaviour."
 kheionai_flavour.10.a: "Our people should be able to live their lives as they please"
 kheionai_flavour.10.b: "This is verging on debauchery, shut them down already!"

 kheionai_flavour.11.t: "Scéposmatists Question the Franchise"
 kheionai_flavour.11.d: "Scéposmatism, a school born in Lokemeion, has long been at the forefront of questioning the pre-existing ideals and taboo’s of our society and openly criticize Philosophical ideas that have been viewed as standard in our society. Though many see them as little more than public nuisances, one area in which their views stir up the most trouble is their views on the political rights of minorities, particularly women and non-citizens.\n\nRecently the Scéposmatists of your captial have been pushing for the extension of certain political rights to these people, though such an act would certainly be extremely de-stabilising."
 kheionai_flavour.11.a: "This is an offense to our values, we will not be accepting this"

 kheionai_flavour.15.t: "Breaking Down Walls"
 kheionai_flavour.15.d: "Throughout the past few months, it has become increasingly evident that a woman of immense talent and ambition from one of our more prestigious lower families is making a name for herself. She has inspired her own movement in our political scene, with supporters rallying to her for breaking down walls in the more entrenched parts of society. Her very status embodies the values we have seen reflected in Maedritic thought, an idea that many cannot ignore, despite it drawing the ire of her patriarchal superiors. An option has presented itself, however, to endorse her movement as part of our administration. Welcoming her to our court could be a boon in terms of introducing new perspectives, but it may seriously upset more traditional elements of our city."
 kheionai_flavour.15.a: "We can’t just turn away from such talent!"
 kheionai_flavour.15.b: "She seems to be doing fine on her own."
 kheionai_flavour.15.c: "Her message resonates with Maedritic philosophy; she will help us practice it."
 
 kheionai_flavour.16.t: "Politeia"
 kheionai_flavour.16.d: "A question that began as a simple philosophical debate between two well-respected elves has begun to take on a life of its own. The debate has swept throughout our society and captured the minds of our most prestigious scholars. The scale of such a philosophical inquiry will surely be remembered for centuries to come. While there is a wealth of discourse being conducted high and low, one facet of the debate has played out in our own halls of government. Various philosophers attempt to court the favor of our administration, which they seek the prestige and patronage of. As the crowd ripples with philosophical fervor, surely one speaker stands out among the rest?"
 kheionai_flavour.16.a: "A Maedritic philosopher managed to sway the crowd."
 kheionai_flavour.16.b: "A follower of Isparokaeus managed to sway the crowd."
 kheionai_flavour.16.c: "An Axierophonic philosopher managed to sway the crowd."
 kheionai_flavour.16.dd: "We all have something to learn from today’s debate."

 kheionai_flavour.17.t: "Feeding the Famished"
 kheionai_flavour.17.d: "Following the recent Deathwind, it was discovered that significant portions of our grain fields now lay fallow, the year’s harvest utterly devastated by the all-destroying dust storms that care for neither animal nor plant. Though we have yet to actually deplete our existing stores, it is evident that there will be grain shortages unless we act to ensure that what little remains is kept for the people who are already left to recover from the devastation of the Deathwind. The most drastic option proposed would be forbidding grain exports until the supply is manageable once more. However, this would severely impact our trading interests for the time being, requiring several harvests to pass before permitting grain to flow outward as it once did."
 kheionai_flavour.17.a: "Impose autarky to keep extra grain on our markets."
 kheionai_flavour.17.b: "The situation does not merit such a response. The market will regulate itself."
 kheionai_flavour.17.c: "Initiate reforms to ensure farmers' land for future grain production."
 kheionai_flavour.17.dd: "Enact legislation to help our farmers expand their grain production."

 kheionai_flavour.18.t: "Changes in Warfare"
 kheionai_flavour.18.d: "With a thundering crackle and rising smoke, the firearms hit their expected targets several fields away. The officers glance at one another and then at the Cannorian merchants standing behind them, their arms crossed with a grin. One of them speaks, and our translator steps in. “Impressive, are they not? It is exactly as advertised. Death-from-afar. Surely you see the benefits of such a weapon?” The officers once again exchange looks and turn to our court officials. Such a weapon would indeed be devastating on the battlefield, able to cut down enemies faster than they can react. However, this begs the question of what happens when our soldiers must face these firearms, bullets ripping through our own. As the merchants return to their vessels, our leadership must decide how to adapt to what is undeniably the future of warfare."
 kheionai_flavour.18.a: "Have our existing formations receive a gunnery division."
 kheionai_flavour.18.b: "Summon the mages; we must armor ourselves against these guns."
 kheionai_flavour.18.c: "Death-from-afar indeed! Have the entire army outfitted immediately."
 
 kheionai_flavour.19.t: "Wild, Wild Magic"
 kheionai_flavour.19.d: "One of our braver merchants has returned after braving the waters off the Kaydhano Sea to do business in Amadia, a land our scholars have not recorded in some time. Along with sizable cargo, the merchant is accompanied by a group of tall, pale-skinned elves adorned with peculiar scars. They are evidently Amadians, masters of wild magic. What was once a subject of sailors’ stories now stands outside our city with our Kheionai captain. He refuses to dock elsewhere or abandon his crew, claiming they are the finest sailors he has ever had. As many of our citizens panic, recalling past records of wild magic and what it could cause for the windward, others admire the captain’s tenacity, saying it would be uncivilized to deny him and his crew hospitality."
 kheionai_flavour.19.a: "It is too great of a risk to our Kheion’s infrastructure. They must go."
 kheionai_flavour.19.b: "We can’t just refuse the captain and his goods. We’ll watch the Amadians."
 kheionai_flavour.19.c: "An excellent opportunity to study Amadian culture and customs!"

 kheionai_flavour.20.t: "A Question of Love"
 kheionai_flavour.20.d: "A scandal has rocked the court of $COUNTRY$. A prominent political leader from one of our noble houses has been exposed for an extensive love affair after decades of a seemingly happy marriage. The stories are already running wild on the streets, with rumors about everything from the noble’s personal life to our own administration being involved in the affair. The very moral standards of our Kheinsí are now subject to public scrutiny that has not been seen for some time now, and people from all parts of society clamor for our Kylakas to intervene personally and give judgment on the affair. While it may be one of our nobles, the backlash from the sheer taboo and his status may prove overwhelming."
 kheionai_flavour.20.a: "Heavily fine the unfortunate lover."
 kheionai_flavour.20.b: "Helping this politician will improve our standing amongst the nobility."
 kheionai_flavour.20.c: "Perhaps we could strike a compromise that satisfies both sides?"
 
 kheionai_flavour.21.t: "Too close for Comfort"
 kheionai_flavour.21.d: "As regular surveying is being conducted in the urban centers surrounding our windward, it has become apparent that there is an overcrowding problem. People are living in spaces that simply cannot properly accommodate their needs, all in order to live in close proximity to the most reliable shelter. While renovations could be undertaken to accommodate these citizens within the windward, it would require evictions in existing portions of the Kheion to reconstruct them properly, which would certainly upset those within the walls already. Regardless, our policy must be decided upon for these citizens in order to protect them from the coming Deathwind, inside or outside of the city."
 kheionai_flavour.21.a: "Clearly some renovation plans are in order. "
 kheionai_flavour.21.b: "Refugees from a countryside will have to get comfortable in the streets."
 kheionai_flavour.21.c: "Our Kheion cannot fit these refugees. We shall make new shelters."
 kheionai_flavour.21.dd: "We must make a perfect plan to satisfy everyone!"

 kheionai_flavour.22.t: "Sheltering their Faith"
 kheionai_flavour.22.d: "Following our recent subjugation of the neighboring Eltibhen, the local militia has reported that a passage near the Meteí would make for an ideal shelter against the Deathwinds. The militia has preemptively marched into the pass, constructing the beginnings of shelters for future use. The local Eltibhen chieftain, however, was outraged when he arrived to find part of the sacred pilgrimage route to the Meteí being blocked off by these easterners. Today, the chieftain himself arrived in a fury at the gates of our Kheion. He is beseeching our administration to order the militia out of the pass to respect their customs as lawful subjects, appealing to our faith of reason. We must respond soon, lest the tensions escalate."
 kheionai_flavour.22.a: "Don't they understand they will get to use this shelter too?"
 kheionai_flavour.22.b: "It would be an ethically correct thing to respect the local beliefs for the time being."
 kheionai_flavour.22.c: "If they don't like our militia, they are welcome to move somewhere else."

 kheionai_flavour.23.t: "To Serve or to Protect?"
 kheionai_flavour.23.d: "It is said of the office of Kylakas that he, who has a mighty army, is capable of protecting both his kheion and his nékheis. Such a philosophy has been put to the test with a recent proposal in our governmental policy. Some of our council members argue that we should neglect to fund our nékheis’ military in favor of our levies on Alecand. The members aligned with the nékheis, however, have loudly objected to such a proposal. They argue that to maintain and expand our presence in Devand, it's prudent to send additional funding and resources to the nékheis at once. One way or another, one of these factions may walk out dissatisfied."
 kheionai_flavour.23.a: "We must invest more resources in our presence on Alecand."
 kheionai_flavour.23.b: "We shall listen to the nékheis and fund their expansion efforts."
 kheionai_flavour.23.c: "Remind the nékheis that defense of the realm is, without question, a joint effort."

 kheionai_flavour.24.t: "The Legend of Seven Seas"
 kheionai_flavour.24.d: "A captain of an ambitious trading fleet has returned after some years, bringing with him tales of a faraway land recorded as “Haraf”. He describes adventures that seem almost fantastical, from evading titanic worms that burrow through the sands to defending his crew against twisted elves that carve their skin into eerie works of art. He also carries with him an ornate mask that he claims is imbued with the spirits of fallen warriors and speaks of a ritual that allows him to commune with his ancestors from centuries past through the very currents of water itself. Many of our people find his stories unbelievable, but regardless, he has decided to donate some of his wealth acquired while on this wild journey."
 kheionai_flavour.24.a: "Regardless of his stories, his donation is most certainly welcomed."
 kheionai_flavour.24.b: "We could use a scoundrel like him."
 kheionai_flavour.24.c: "You know what? His stories aren’t half bad for a privateer. Let’s make this story official."

 kheionai_flavour.25.t: "Inept Philosophers"
 kheionai_flavour.25.d: "As another day arises, the schools that work so diligently to cultivate the best minds in our realm open once more. Students and public audiences alike trickle in to watch our philosophers debate and give speeches. To outside observers, though, it is apparent that the crowds have been dwindling in the past few months. Even those who watch do not appear remotely captivated by what our once-revered philosophers have to say, and students are showing up in lesser numbers with each session. It is increasingly evident that even the masses believe dark times are upon our people, with the foundations of our very culture in decay."
 kheionai_flavour.25.a: "It is the truth. Our culture has seen brighter times."
 kheionai_flavour.25.b: "Any historian would know such small matters plague every state through time."

 kheionai_flavour.26.t: "Akratos"
 kheionai_flavour.26.d: "A tradition of the kheion of Kimanis, the yearly festival seems to have grown out of control this time around. The local militia commander we had appointed has been seen to drink so much Kimanis wine that he rode his chariot through a local school repeatedly. Worse still, the militia itself also took the excuse to drink themselves into a stupor. Becoming more of an unruly mob, they reportedly have been seen using windows as target practice, stumbling off dangerous heights, and harassing the local merchants. Some Kimabhen have declared that this is a plot by our administration to ruin their city, but it is difficult to address the locals. They too are drunk from the same festival wine, causing the people to similarly become a drunken crowd. Unless we intervene somehow, Kimanis will be out of control soon enough."
 kheionai_flavour.26.a: "Stop the militias and the crowds; cease the chaos however necessary."
 kheionai_flavour.26.b: "We mustn’t provoke the Kimabhen any further."

 kheionai_flavour.27.t: "Unruly Nékheis"
 kheionai_flavour.27.d: "Yet another messenger has arrived today from our Nékheis, delivering a firm denial of our recent policy decisions. This is yet another incident in a long line of refusals by our subordinate governors to cooperate with the administration from the Kheion itself. Even when they do acquiesce to our requests, they are fulfilled in such a manner that almost comes across as sabotage to our administrators. More often than not, though, the backlash is so obstructive it prevents any meaningful progress. It has become apparent to both administrations that we simply lack many of the bonds that once drew our Nékheis to prosper under our rule."
 kheionai_flavour.27.a: "It is regrettable, but undeniable."
 kheionai_flavour.27.b: "We just need to find the right approach to them."

 kheionai_flavour.28.t: "The Man Who Bought the World"
 kheionai_flavour.28.d: "A troubling report sits on the table of the Kylakas. A local and powerful aristocrat is quickly on his way to becoming the richest man in the known world. Alongside his wealth, he has begun to exert his influence on the politics of our Kheinsí. He rallies support from the common populace, arguing for a more powerful executive, even implying he himself may run for Kylakas to make it happen! This could be the man that brings our Kheinsí to its knees with the terrible plague of tyranny. We could investigate the doings of this man, but it may prompt him to act. Must we intervene for the sake of the Kheinsí?"
 kheionai_flavour.28.a: "Surely, one man cannot corrupt our entire republic?"
 kheionai_flavour.28.b: "Order a spy sent to his estate; we must know his intentions!"

 kheionai_flavour.29.t: "Investigation Results"
 kheionai_flavour.29.d: "The messenger runs desperately into the council hall of the Kheinsí, waving his arms and bringing word from the estate of the prospective tyrant. He collapses to his knees, out of breath from the run. His message reverberates throughout the chamber. Our spies sent to infiltrate the man’s home were apprehended outside of his villa. The tyrant has taken this as a chance to act prematurely, declaring his civil rights to be violated by our illegitimate regime. He now amasses his supporters across the realm, ordering them to march against our armies! We must act quickly to prevent their success, hasty as it may be."
 kheionai_flavour.29.a: "At least we forced their hand. Disperse this rabble!"

 kheionai_flavour.30.t: "Grand Feast"
 kheionai_flavour.30.d: "The messenger returns to our council hall at a brisk walk, still with a sense of purpose, but not even a hint of panic about the situation with the prospective tyrant. The advisors immediately lay into him, demanding an update on this rich upstart. He begins his message. The attitude of the room shifts away from worry as he continues. Yesterday, the tyrant was hosting a grand banquet with his supporters, before intending to have them march on our Kheion. This meal, however, proved to be his last, as he suddenly doubled over while choking on the leg of a roasted boar! Such a man was doomed to have his greed consume him!"
 kheionai_flavour.30.a: "It seems that fate was on our side this time!"

 kheionai_flavour.31.t: "The Tyrant Acts!"
 kheionai_flavour.31.d: "The messenger stumbles into our council hall, out of breath from avoiding the army approaching the gates of the city. The council is outraged, not knowing there even was such an army outside until now. The messenger explains that communication has broken down outside the capital. The tyrant has seized on our ignorance to amass an army of mercenaries, pirates, and fellow aristocrats to rebel for the office of Kylakas! We must act swiftly to put this revolt down, though the army is lesser due to his supporters being pacified by our leniency. It leaves the remaining populace baffled by our incompetency and permitting such a revolt to arise, questioning our legitimacy in the face of such actions."
 kheionai_flavour.31.a: "How could we have let this come to pass?"

 degarikes_taychendi:0 "Though we have not always been seafaring people - even the Thekrystana, who rely on the water for their wealth, are ill at ease on the open ocean - one look at these ships is all it takes to know of their glory. Imagine an entire fleet of them, terrorising the seas and projecting Taychendi power across the waves! And with the secrets of the Slaver-Nobles beneath our feet, one wonders just how big these ships can get..."
 degarikes_eltibhari:0 "Though we may have achieved dominance over the island of Alecand itself, the Kheionai maintained an extensive maritime empire. With an endless expanse of open ocean to our shores, we have never truly been able to grasp naval combat - now, if we are to expand our Riei's domain further, we must master it. Thankfully, we can turn to our new territories to do so."

 degarikes_devandi:0 "The Chendhyan lake-pirates of the Taras'su Ervan made a habit of boarding trading vessels and unleashing their feline mounts on the unprepared sailors. Though we may not have the maritime traditions of the Kheionai, a distinct possibility arises when looking at their titanic vessels - they seem to be big enough to hold a large number of mounts at any one time, and they certainly have the armour to plunge into an enemy fleet and not be destroyed. Maybe it is time to let the open oceans know the terror a jaguar-rider can bring?"
 degarikes_oktikheion:0 "When we lost our fleet and our army north of the Kaydhano, we were forced to downsize our navy dramatically, our coffers exhausted. It took decades for our city's population to recover, and only after the seizure of Kimánis could we begin to prepare our naval resurgence, and begin to build more Degárikes. But over 50 years had passed since any of our engineers had laid eyes on them - it was a long and arduous process, even with the extensive plans already in our possession. We were not the first to bring back these ships, but we will not be the last. Our engineers have now made all the necessary preparations, and we can begin rebuilding our fleet at once."
 degarikes_kheionai:0 "When Oktikheion blundered their entire fleet and a quarter of their male population into a watery grave, the Degárikes, titanic in size and power, but expensive to build and maintain, nearly died with it. Oktikheion had long forced the other Kheions into a naval arms race in which they did not want to participate - when the biggest player was forced out of the game, the others raced to see who could withdraw the fastest. Now, with the world growing more dangerous, the need for these titanic ships once more grows. We were not the first to reintroduce them, but that will not deter us - our engineers have dusted off old naval plans, and we will soon begin construction."

#Events 
 kheionai.30.t:0 "New Threats on the Seas" 
 kheionai.30.d:0 "In 1397, the fleet of Oktikheion, the greatest naval power in the Kheionai World, sailed beyond the horizon. Nearing bankruptcy due to the loss of Althungoti's gold, the imposing Degárikes that broke Ormam's hegemony, surrounded by scores of triremes and transport ships, made for Amadia, hoping to win back the riches that once built their fleet.\n\n10 years later, a single ship returned. The expeditionary army had been broken in the wilds of the north, and the fleet scoured by a stray Deathwind. Oktikheion was ruined, their women and children left wailing in the streets for the husbands, fathers, brothers and sons who would never return. But in the rest of the Kheions, treasurers and naval planners alike breathed a sigh of relief - Oktikheion's dreaded fleet, its titanic Degárikes in particular, lay at the bottom of the ocean. Why, then, must they try to match them? The cities of Alecand scaled back their naval spending, laid their Degárikes to rest - most were scrapped for wood and metal.\n\nBut the tide has turned once more. Kimanis has fallen. The Nékhei of Amgremós, cut loose and adrift, has turned to the pirates of the Cleaved Sea for protection, who now use their harbour to prey on the ships bringing the riches of Taychend back to Kheionai shores. And, of course, with Oktikheion's green flying over Kimánis' Silken-Harbour, the fears of a naval resurgence mount, and whispers abound of Oktíbhen engineers digging into their archives for old plans and schematics. Many wonder: perhaps it is time to dig up old plans of our own?"
 kheionai.30.a:0 "The Cleaved Sea is not safe…" 
 
 kheionai.31.t:0 "Titans of the Seas" 
 kheionai.31.d:0 "Ardores, one of the richest pirates in the Cleaved Sea, commander of a full fleet of triremes and captain of the Kraken's Dread, was awoken from his slumber by a call from outside. There was commotion as the ship began to turn, though he had ordered no such manoeuvre. When Ardores rushed to the deck, he saw his entire fleet at battlestations, sails drawn down and oars pushed out. Soon enough, he saw why - there was a single ship on the horizon, barrelling towards them. He saw a group of small dots spring from its decks and draw closer.\n\n“ARTILLERY!” Ardores called, as he made for the helm. A few seconds later, the boulder-like shot whizzed past, missing his own ship but striking some of the others under his command. He watched as the stones pierced decks, turned pirates and sailors to bloody ruins. Ships drifted as their oarsmen faltered, and the fleet slowed, confused. Even as its artillery fired, though, the enemy vessel kept its course, straight for the Kraken's Dread. One ship against a fleet - but it was no normal ship. It was a Degárikes.\n\n“It's going to ram us…” the pirate-captain realised, as he paled. His first mate tugged at him, begging for orders, but Ardores simply stared at his nearing doom. It was massive, taller than two triremes atop each other, and with a ram like a kraken's beak. A force of nature not seen in decades, since the disaster beyond the Kaydhano. Sailors abandoned ship as the Degárikes approached, then made contact. The Kraken's Dread gave an ear-shattering scream as wood splintered, then snapped. The force of the ship falling apart threw Ardores backwards. The Degárikes cleaved through and kept going.\n\nArdores watched in disbelief as the Degárikes tore his fleet apart. The artillery on board kept firing, turning fleeing ships into shattered splinters as archers rained arrowfire from up high on any unlucky pirates still living. Marines rappelled down the decks, ready to haul what cargo they could from the wrecks and finish off any stragglers. The Degárikes were back - may all its enemies beware."

 kheionai.32.d.b:0 "The Degárikes of the Kheionai are masterworks of naval engineering, titanic vessels that can hold rows of heavy artillery on their decks, as well as a massive complement of archers and marines. Dreaded throughout the known world, they have been in use for centuries, most famously used by Oktikheion to contest Ormam's naval hegemony in the Great Sea Wars of the 10th and 11th centuries. Though they experienced a dark period in the early 1400s, as the loss of Oktikheion's formidable fleet in the Second Amadian Expedition led to their disuse, recent conflict in the Cleaved Sea has led to their revival.\n\n[Root.GetDegarikesDesc]\n\nIn terms of construction, valuable information from our conquered Kheionai territories has more or less revealed the secrets to Degárikes construction - soon, our engineers believe they will be able to begin building our own vessels. Unfortunately, the Degárikes require large and specialised harbours, and there are few ports outside Kheionai lands in which they can be built and docked - if we are to expand our fleet of Degárikes, we must conquer more Kheionai Shipyards."

 kheionai.32.d.k:0 "[Root.GetDegarikesDesc]\n\nThe Degárikes are so massive that they require specialised harbours and shipyards in which they can be first constructed, and then safely docked once they're complete. Apart from the obvious problem of draining a suitable drydock for hull repairs and retrofits - and when you're dealing with a wooden ship, unwarded, longer than two krakens laid side-by-side, there WILL be repairs and retrofits - an unsheltered Degárikos is liable to be literally torn apart if caught in a storm. Only our people have made these modifications - if we are to increase the size of our fleet, we will need to seize more Kheionai Shipyards."
