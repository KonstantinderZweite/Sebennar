 flavor_khozrugan.1.d:0 "Ancient traditions are not forgotten in one day. It is a long, complicated process, which requires a lot of patience and effort. Unfortunately, we have neither of those. Artug Ostokhan, chief of the most powerful clan in Khozrugan, has arrived in the palace of our ruler and challenged him to an Ozarm'Chadash, a duel to the death between the ruler and whomever sees him as unfit for reigning over a clan or country. This a true orcish challenge, one that can be solved only on the battlefield. If our ruler rejects the duel, he and his relatives will be ashamed for eternity, and Artug's claims will be proven. Combat is the only solution."

 flavor_khozrugan.2.d:0 "An Ozarm'Chadash is not a rare occasion in orcish clans, but this is the first time when the whole country is at stake. Your upcoming fight with Artug in the city's arena has gathered countless orcs from whole capital. The immense crowd is yelling both your names, but you feel like your opponent has more supporters. You may be a skilled fighter, but Artug is considered to be the strongest. Doubting if you have what it takes to win this fight you enter the arena together with your opponent. And it is probably the first-time you've personally met this two-meter high bulked up orc. He easily swings with his ritual battleaxe and smirks when you enter the battlefield. At this very moment a single thought crosses your mind..."
