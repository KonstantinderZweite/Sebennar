 G74_a_throne_for_the_queen_title: "A Throne for the Queen"
 G74_a_throne_for_the_queen_desc: "The ties between us and Darkalyndar have roots deep in the past: one of the only Chendhyans to accept Olhokar's rule, they served the Gophiran Emperors faithfully for centuries. But the past is the past, and the current rulers of the city can't be trusted to keep our nation on amicable terms. Harrihara X is determined to put his wife Azhera, the eldest child of Uramat IV, and thus the rightful heir to Darkalyndar's throne, into power - that, he believes, will ensure our nations' friendship.\nBut, some on the court ask, can she be trusted?"

 G74_tribes_chief_title: "The Tribes Chief"
 G74_tribes_chief_desc: "Darkalyndar, being naturally inclined towards cosmopolitanism, already enjoys a fruitful relationship with the Sarihaddi tribe that lives inside its borders, who they contract with to scour the desert for relics. Rather than wasting blood and treasure trying to pacify the Sarihaddi tribes; we have made the mistake of attempting before. We should extend Darkalyndae rule to the other tribes to have our Chendhyans allies be, at least nominally, masters of the desert."

 G74_two_nations_one_army_title: "Two Nations, One Army"
 G74_two_nations_one_army_desc: "Our empires have all been built on the back of our heavy infantry, unparalleled on the continent. But Darkalyndar has always been at our side, bringing maneuverability and the shock of a sudden charge to our armies. In our hubris we had forgotten that, and undervalued their contribution. An elite cavalry opens up a myriad of new options on the battlefield.\n\nWe are still bad at this mounted business, and the Chendyhans are not. But we can't risk losing a battle just because we couldn't regroup in time or had a miscommunication with the Darkalyndae. So, the utmost effort will be put into deeply integrating our two armies, to reach new pinnacles of military might!"

 G74_two_nations_one_territory_title: "Two Nations, One Territory"
 G74_two_nations_one_territory_desc: "Opening the borders with Darkalyndar wasn't part of a grand plan, just a question of opportunity and resources; while we expected some merchants to make use of that, what we didn't imagine was people migrating across the border, and the boon that would provide our kingdoms: knowledges are shared, previously empty territories get exploited, more wealth is produced. We shall now encourage and fund these movements, for it will start a golden era for both our realms."

 G74_two_people_one_nation_title: "Two People, One Nation"
 G74_two_people_one_nation_desc: "Our armies are many limbs of a single body, our lands many fields for one melting pot of peoples, our king - one, for two thrones. Just the final step of a centuries-long path together is missing to make our nations from two, one."

 G74_control_the_relics_title: "Control the Relics"
 G74_control_the_relics_desc: "Taychendi empires have been made and dismantled by powerful Relic-wielding Lords; the Gophiran Emperors never needed a relic to create an empire, but it would be foolish to underestimate those items' power. As such, it's imperative that we keep a tight control on the places where most often Relics are found. Close to our borders, the deserts of Sarihaddu and Bukkana Varanya are filled to the brim with ancient artifacts: our men need to control what comes out of there.\n\nThe Green Desert could be said to already be ours, by virtue of our newly gained subject of Darkalyndar, but the Chendhyans’ cut is expensive - a permanent Yodhanpir garrison will have to be established there to interact with the local Sarihaddi tribe without Darkalyndae middlemen."

 G74_first_line_of_offence_title: "First Line of Offence"
 G74_first_line_of_offence_desc: "Darkalyndar is very proud of its army.\n"Elite Chendhyans jaguar riders mixed with infantry on par with Gophira's Ironblood army!"\nVery well, let them flex it. They'll be the first to charge in our battles, our attack jaguars.\nBut no matter what they tell themselves, a copy will always be only just a copy; our heavy infantry has no equals and we don't need theirs: have them focus on the jaguars, that will suit our needs more."

 G74_war_economy_title: "War Economy"
 G74_war_economy_desc: "The Tydhzegaeda, Darkalyndar's jaguars, are smart, quick, strong and fearsome, but what they are not is cheap – unlike horses, they are carnivores, and meat is much harder to supply than grain or feed. Still, we intend to expand their number as much as possible, by focusing Darkalyndar’s economy on them.\n\nWe'll build the infrastructure - livestock ranches, catteries, training grounds - and the Chendhyans will be the workers and riders. We'll have the Chendhyans herders and riders inside our border migrate there to work, and the rest, if they don't want to follow, will be encouraged to adopt our customs and become proper Taychendi."

 G74_our_weapons_their_riders_title: "Our Weapons, Their Riders"
 G74_our_weapons_their_riders_desc: "With the improved forging capabilities, we have some spare weapons: these can be given to our refound friends in Darkalyndar and, in exchange, enlist some of their cavalry will fight for us.\nWho knows, in the future it could be more than a few units."

 G74_rekindle_the_forges_title: "Rekindle the Forges"
 G74_rekindle_the_forges_desc: "We're not Kattisangamar or Banderuttai, we don't waste days on a single shield or spear to claim perfection. What we pride ourselves on is the sheer amount of metalwork our forges produce.\nBut it's not enough, we need more, the army hungers for iron. We need direct control of the other Iron Cities, their blacksmiths' hands, their furnaces' mouths."

 G74_back_with_a_vengeance_title: "Back with a Vengeance"
 G74_back_with_a_vengeance_desc: "Laskaris believe he'll be the man to unite Taychend; fueled by the prophecy of the Fateweaver, he has quickly expanded his domains, even at our expense, and now he's eyeing Gophira. But he'll find out the only destiny possible for these lands is to be ruled by us, his victory against our coalition just a fleeting mistake we'll quickly rectify; we'll make him understand why his grandparents were paying tribute to us.\n\nWe shall try and reforge the coalition among those who suffered at his hands, stronger than the first, for they have everything to lose now. But even without it, we'll throw this invader back to the sea he came from."

 G74_an_oath_twice_broken_title: "An Oath Twice Broken"
 G74_an_oath_twice_broken_desc: "Twice already our Empire trusted the Mudaliars to keep their loyalty, after we showed them mercy. First, they betrayed Olhokar and the oath they made at Periyakq, joining in on the perfidious warlords who sought to depose him in his darkest hour. In the second instance, at the close of the Second Gophiran Empire, they raised the Kalavend in revolt – bringing unparalleled devastation to their lands, as the Red Thunder ravaged them for their treachery.\nThere shan't be a third."

 G74_the_northern_pretender_title: "The Northern Pretender"
 G74_the_northern_pretender_desc: "Urvand is by far the biggest and most successful of the kingdoms that came out of the Fifth Age of Ambition, even going as far as naming their state Larankar, to signal their dominant position on the region.\n\nJust. Another. Pretender.\n\nWe'll take them down like all the others, for we are the only master of Thaychend."

 G74_third_and_eternal_title: "Third and Eternal"
 G74_third_and_eternal_desc: "It's time. It's time to end any leftover pretention of indipendence from any warlord foolish enough to resist us. It's time to show the world the best army ever to ever exist. It's time to cement our rule, and set in motion the transition to a new cycle, one of Iron, not of glory.\n\nIt's time to proclaim the Third Gophiran Empire."

 G74_third_and_eternal_fren_title: "Third And Eternal"
 G74_third_and_eternal_fren_desc: "It's time. It's time to end any leftover pretention of indipendence from any warlord foolish enough to resist us. It's time to show the world the best army ever to ever exist. It's time to cement our rule, and set in motion the transition to a new cycle, one of Iron, not of glory.\n\nIt's time to proclaim the Third Gophiran Empire."

 G74_third_and_eternal_march_title: "Third and Eternal"
 G74_third_and_eternal_march_desc: "It's time. It's time to end any leftover pretention of indipendence from any warlord foolish enough to resist us. It's time to show the world the best army ever to ever exist. It's time to cement our rule, and set in motion the transition to a new cycle, one of Iron, not of glory.\n\nIt's time to proclaim the Third Gophiran Empire."

 G74_a_relic_for_the_fort_title: "A Relic for the Fort"
 G74_a_relic_for_the_fort_desc: "Our nation was born with the Fort, named after it, and for a millennium we kept improving and expanding its bastions, just as the Greenbringer would have wanted.\n\nAfter news arrived that a powerful relic was discovered by a Darkalyndar soldier, capable of creating a weak barrier between him and an enemy, our mages quickly realized it could be a boon for our citadel; Darkalyndar let us know that they're willing to part from the relic for a price, as they don't see an use for it - though whispers say it's because there's already been a death in the court trying to exploit it. No matter, to strengthen the Fort, this and more."

 G74_the_great_kannalulthe_title: "The Great Kannalulthe"
 G74_the_great_kannalulthe_desc: "Oh Kannalulthe! Wonder\nof the Second Empire!\nWalking your roads\nagain, tracing my steps\non your stones, old friend,\nmakes my heart fill up\nwith life, for what has been,\nmy eyes shine\nwith mirth, for what will come.\nThe sorrow for the present\nis ephemeral, a ripple\nin the water over your dam."

 G74_everybody_replaceable_title: "Everybody's Replaceable"
 G74_everybody_replaceable_desc: "At the close of the Second Empire, the combination of the Dannasanhas being too invested in imperial politics, and dynastic disputes engulfing the Sangamar dynasty, joined together to fuel a cataclysmic spiral that eventually led to Gophira's collapse. Our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and his advisor have been deeply aware of this problem, but the fear of decreasing the Ironbloods readiness halted any plans that would tackle the issue. Until now.\n\nOur recent campaigns have shown us that our soldiers, always training or fighting, are perfectly able to go to battle without any "noble generals". While the warlords can still tag along on our conquests, only the best of the Ironblood themselves can be allowed to rise to the very top.\nWith their usefulness greatly reduced and the soldiers loyal to us, the Warlords will have had their influence on the army gutted for good."

 G74_lean_on_the_warlords_title: "Lean on the Warlords"
 G74_lean_on_the_warlords_desc: "We need to face it, we're weak. A pathetic rump state of what was - and the Ironblood Army is a shadow of its former self. We need men, and the warlords have them. They know our need, and will ask for much in exchange. Control of the armies they'll give us, first of all.\n\nBut our history already has seen what happens if the army gets divided in several banners, each his own Dannasan -the commander- private fief. The territory the Iron Banner is supposed to garrison becomes its land, more important to them than the nation; each Great Banner becomes a separate entity from the others, and has no qualms whatsoever in fighting them to the death - countryman against countryman. We can't let it happen again.\n\nIt's better to grant them the other thing they're interested in: land. But in order to do that, and not ruin ourselves in the meantime, we need to take that gift from others."

 G74_train_them_to_perfection_title: "Train Them to Perfection"
 G74_train_them_to_perfection_desc: "The Second Empire proved what having the only professional army in a sea of poorly trained levies and disloyal mercenaries meant. The Iron Banner system may have failed and dragged us to collapse, but even the War of the Six Emperors needed 20 years of brutal civil war before the Empire would finally come apart at the seams, due to the strength of our army.\n\nThis to say, we need to steel, by training or by battle, these so-called "soldiers" we got from the warlords and reestablish the Ironblood Army out of them and the rest of our levies.\n\nWe'll deal with the consequences later."

 G74_a_question_of_loyalty_title: "A Question of Loyalty"
 G74_a_question_of_loyalty_desc: "The decision to lean on the Warlords and invest in a permanent army is already showing its poisoned fruits. Warlords and generals acquired a lot of power and, as power begets power, they are quickly increasing it.\nOne would think it should be imperative to keep those strongmen loyal. Wrong.\n\nTo foster loyalty in someone who's already powerful is always a failing enterprise: unless they're the best of elves, it will be a matter of giving and taking - with always the risk of having somebody able, or willing, to give more who will steal that loyalty away.\nThat's why the focus will be on those who are powerful only in number instead, the common soldier, whose devotion, once gained, is yours to lose.\nBy love, or by fear, their hearts will be ours.\n\nWhat is a Warlord without an army, anyway?"

 #Events
 gophira.1.t: "Like Cat and Dog"
 gophira.1.d: "Since the end of the Second Empire, Gophira had suffered nothing but defeat and humiliation, their once mighty realm weakening, fracturing. After the foreign invader Laskaris cut down Harrihara’s father at Hadasyinlad, even their nominal allies had abandoned them. Now Gophira was reduced to the fort that started it all – and him? The rightful ruler of Taychend, last heir to the greatest empire in history? On the same level as those other wanna-be kings, men closer to bandits than monarchs...\n\nAt least, he still had two saving graces in the world – his childhood friend Vindar, who had stood by him through all he’d been through, and his wife, Azhera, the scorned princess of Darkalyndar, a once-ally turned traitor-city. He had raised Vindar as the second most powerful elf in Gophira to shore up his weaknesses, and married Azhera to gain Darkalyndar – but even in this, there were problems. The two advisors despised each other – ideologically and emotionally they were completely opposed. They argued about policies, faith and Heroes, treaties, animal companions, morality, the weather, his son's education, judgements… how best to reclaim the empire he’d lost.\n\nToday's matter of discussion is, not for the first time, about styles of government, specifically which of the two Empires of Gophira - Olhokar's and The Second Empire - followed the right direction. Vindar argue Olhokar's way of dealing with defeated enemies - being magnanimous and quick to integrate former foes in the fold - is superior, it prevents bad blood and future revolts; Azhera is a follower of the Second Empire style: every threat to the nation needs to be responded quickly, with ruthless and excessive force. Harrihara would lean on his wife's side usually - he has no patience nor piety for anybody who dares to defy his rule - but he knew that he did not have the realm the Second Empire started with. As the argument threatened to boil over, he wondered – was mercy really so poisonous to might?"
 gophira.1.1: "Fine! Azhera, you're right, I agree. Now out, both of you!"
 gophira.1.2: "Fine! Vindar, I see your point, let's go with that. Now out, both of you!"
 gophira.1.tt: "\nAs the firstborn son, Thanal is especially doted upon, and only him will benefit from the best educators."

 gophira.2.t: "A Companion for our Son"
 gophira.2.d: "Harrihara swirled the wine cup in his hand, took a sip. "Well… since his birthday, Thanal has begun pestering everyone to get him a pet: his tutors, his mother, even me. I think it's only right and proper that our heir has a strong animal at his side, but... last night Azhera talked about gifting him a Tydhzegaeda cub. She said, ‘their independence and ferocity would teach Thanal how to rule!’ And, well, I have to admit, few beasts can compete with a jaguar's majesty – and if he bonds with it? Imagine a Gophiran King riding a jaguar to battle!"\n\nHarrihara studied his friend - oh he was imagining it alright! Vindar had the most hilarious expression since the cat was first mentioned -some kind of disgusted horror- and the grimace kept worsening the more he'd talk about it. The enjoyment he was finding in that quickly faded though, when Vindar exploded.\n"You'd give a barely six years old child one of those beasts! Sure, they may look cute when they’re cubs, but in no time at all they'll grow into a bloodthirsty monster! And you want him to ride it too?! Are you mad? A Taychendi King, riding around like some Chendhyan wannabe! Why not a kotakompu instead? A warrior, of course. Those rodents are not lacking when it comes to strength and resistance, but raise them right and they’ll be extremely obedient towards their owner – they see them as one of their queens. How to better teach a young heir to rule than giving him a faithful subject?"\n[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] paused. That's why he liked Vindar. Even at his most outraged, he always managed to produce some good advice. Now he just needed to decide whether to take it."
 gophira.2.1: "Have you really never thought of riding a jaguar?"
 gophira.2.2: "Well, Kotakompu are fine enough…"

 gophira.3.t: "Mother Knows Best"
 gophira.3.d: "Azhera knelt before her son like he was half his age, took his hands into his, looked at him with pleading eyes. “My son, my [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], you're almost 15 -an adult!- we should have a talk about the future. In less than a year you will be old enough to take on all the responsibilities of rulership, but I'm asking you, is it wise? You're smart and strong, you will be a wonderful ruler in time! But you lack experience: ruling Gophira is not just fighting battles and holding court. You'll need to watch for dangers from all sides, "friends" and foes alike; navigate relations with allies, enemies and subjects. Be harsh, cruel even, even if your spirit rebels against it – even if you’re called a monster, a tyrant, an evil witch, by people who don't understand that is what it means to rule!\nCan you really do that, right now? I can – and I can teach you. Won't you let mother shoulder this burden just a bit longer?"\n\nThanal mind raced back to everything he heard lately about his mother: Azhera was a tyrant, much too quick to dispose of anybody who stood against her; a foreigner, dedicated to foisting the Chendhyans into all the position of power; an usurper, that to rule would steal the throne even from her own son.\nHe always dismissed these voices as envious courtiers and lieutenants whom mother had denied from their small selfish interests, but now the doubt was creeping in. Still she was his mother, and it couldn't be argued that the army never was this strong, the state never this solid… But even he had seen what kind of justice Azhera was dispensing. He could hear his mentor Vindar like he was in the room: "Piling bodies nets you only a place on top of the pile." Maybe she was right, or maybe she needed to be saved from herself."
 gophira.3.1: "If you say so..."
 gophira.3.2: "I'm the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and I will rule, mother."
 gophira.3.3: "She thinks I'm not ready. I will show her I am: it's time mother rests."

 gophira.4.t: "And a Chain with It?"
 gophira.4.d: "With the Darkalyndar Succession War finally won and our queen its legitimate ruler, the question that torments Gophira's court is what will be our relationship with Darkalyndar now. Two main camps formed, mostly splitted along their allegiance to either the queen-consort or the chancellor: the first advocating for having Darkalyndar as an independent and strong ally, able to conduct separate wars and dealings according to the queen will; the other want to make a subject out of them, focused on supporting our army, arguing that Gophira spent a lot to put Azhera on the throne, and should get its due payment.\n\nThe tension is palpable in the palace, the two protagonists of the contention unusually void of words to throw at each other, both instead focusing their attention on Harrihara X.\n"Alliances are fickle things my Lord, reason of state dictates that as soon as the nation stop benefitting from it the alliance will be broken. We have to have them as subject, or this war will have been for nothing."\n"Love, it's not any alliance we're talking about here. I'm the nation's ruler AND your wife. This alliance will not be broken, it won't betray you in your time of need or decide it would rather have Gophira territory than its friendship because I'M this alliance. Do you not trust me? You think you need to chain us to Gophira to have my loyalty? Aren't we already chained to each other, me and you, by links stronger than iron?"\n"Even assuming the ruler is trustworthy, will it last? Who can assure us that this one will be able to keep control of her realm, should a revolt break out or a palace coup happen we would be caught unaware. As a subject we would have an ear to the ground and could probably prevent the situation altogether. It would be better for the [Root.Consort.GetTitle] as well, less pressure in ruling knowing she'd always have us at her back."\nThis went on for a few days, while the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] pondered on the choice to take."
 gophira.4.1: "Darkalyndar will be our trusted ally, a light in a continent of darkness."
 gophira.4.2: "Darkalyndar will be our vassal, the first among them, our trusted companion."
 gophira.4.tt: "All §YTaychend§! nations will gain §R5§! aggressive expansion against §YGophira§!."

 gophira.5.t: "A Darkalyndar Brigade"
 gophira.5.d: "The experiment of integrating some Darkalyndar rider units in our army is going extremely well, they have been a powerful asset - our cavalry can't compete with them - and adapted well to the Ironblood training regimen. Our people and soldier have been very welcoming towards the Chendhyans and even our [Root.Heir.GetTitle] has been extremely fascinated by them and their jaguars, frequently disappearing from his tutors' sight only to be found around the Darkalyndars and their mounts.\nBut a small number of soldiers is one thing, having entire companies of foreign soldiers in our army another. Should we take the risk and expand the operation to have an entire Tydhzegaeda brigade?"
 gophira.5.1: "Of course!"
 gophira.5.2: "We don't need them, at least for now."

 gophira.6.t: "Round Two"
 gophira.6.d1: "Harrihara climbed to the vantage point. His armour weighed him down – made the climb difficult – but his soldiers needed to see him in his full glory. Thousands of iron-armored elves were arrayed before him – all looked to him not simply as the hot-headed youth he once was, but as the reclaimer he had become. It was a good feeling.“Gophirans!” He called, as he drew his sabre.“Today's the day we'll right the affront made to us more than a decade ago! Today is the day we take the fight to Ameion!\nMy father Dhalikar III valiantly dueled Laskaris at Hadasyinlad; he lost the duel and his life, but the war against the Ameioni invaders wasn't over. For years my uncle and I strenuously defended Kannalulthe from the besieging Ambheni - and where were the other members of the coalition my father assembled during that time? In their cities, waiting for Laskaris to be done with us – waiting to be picked off one by one.\n\nBut this war will be different! We're stronger now! More determined now! By persuasion or by might, we'll make the traitors and cowards follow us into battle -  and we will be victorious! We'll take back what's ours and more!"
 gophira.6.d2: "Harrihara climbed to the vantage point. His armour weighed him down – made the climb difficult – but his soldiers needed to see him in his full glory. Thousands of iron-armored elves were arrayed before him – all looked to him not simply as the hot-headed youth he once was, but as the reclaimer he had become.

The enemy has to watch its back from our citizens he conquered, who aren't broken yet. And we're stronger now! Even alone, we can win every battle. And we will win them! We'll take back what's ours and more!"
 gophira.6.1: "Ironblood, to war!"
 gophira.6.2: "Ironblood, to war!"
 gophira.6.3: "Ironblood, to war!"

 gophira.7.t: "The Hearth of Taychend"
 gophira.7.d: "Our capital never has been a trade center. Both Old and New Loop do not touch our city, who would instead send its goods to be sold to the rest of the continent - mainly iron products - south to Kannalulthe which was, as Second Empire's capital, a gigantic trade hub. The only alternative route Gophira had was the trail north through Uddachend to connect to the Scrap Loop, but that path never gained much importance.\n\nBut we have learned the lessons of the past – and we know security is far better than wealth. Now, things are finally changing: our resurgence as premier power of the continent coupled with the decision to not dedicate resources on rebuilding Kannalulthe convinced a good number of trade caravans to finally include Gophira as a permanent stop in their route. Paths and roads are being opened, both on the north-south axis and west, towards Darkalyndar. The only unfortunate side effect is that Kannalulthe, already a far cry from its golden age, is further losing importance as a trade center."
 gophira.7.1: "All that wealth shall pass through us."
 
 gophira.8.t: "A New Capital?"
 gophira.8.d: "For a century, Kannalulthe stood as the greatest city of Taychend, a mighty capital that rivaled even Nanru Nakar – but the last Gophiran Emperor, Erradal, the Red Thunder, put the city to the sword in his arrogance. He believed that he could rule by the sword alone – but we now know different.\n\nAfter years of work, on the back of the effort of tens of thousands of workers, free and enslaved, Kannalulthe has been finally restored. It still hasn't returned to what it was: the Dam itself is perfect, its outer side an imposing wall, as strong and solid as it was the first day it was constructed; the Inner District, a semicircular area leaning on the Dam, home to the elite of the city, is - while still beautiful - severely lacking in the opulence that was its pride; the second semicircle, the manufacturing center of the city has been returned to what it was but many of its warehouses are still empty, workshops closed, foundries doused; and the extension is more than a third less of what it was at its peak as the outer semicircle, the biggest one, the slums that housed the workers of the second district, was deemed unworthy to be rebuild for now.\n\nBut the city has space yet to grow. The third circle will grow to fill the old ruins, in time. The workshops of the middle ring will once more be the engine of Taychend, and the mansions of the inner ring will be filled with its great families. It's no longer a sad husk of the past glory, but a new city, brimming with potential, ready to be again filled with millions of people.\n\nOnly one question remains. The Dam City will once again be the biggest in our realm, but should we move the capital there as during the Second Empire, or keep the court and the administration in Gophira - safer, more defensible - like in Olhokar's time?"
 gophira.8.1: "Pack your bags, we're moving!"
 gophira.8.2: "Gophira served us well as the capital."

 gophira.9.t: "Two Nations, One King"
 gophira.9.d1: "A [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has not the right to much time to mourn the death of his parents: mere days after the funeral the coronation ceremony had to take place and then a myriad of tasks awaited him, everything that was delayed to let him officially ascend to the throne.\nAt least the fog Thanal felt on his head was starting to lift, the everyday duties of a ruler of two kingdoms helping in softening the pain of the loss.\nRight, kingdoms. Plural. He will have to formalize the rank of his two crowns, sooner rather than later. There is no doubt in his mind about that at least. He loved his mother's homeland deeply, but he is a gophiran through and through, he grew up running around The Fort, that will always be his home.\nGophira will be the primary title, Darkalyndar's subordinate to it, for him and his heirs as well."
 gophira.9.d2: "Time has passed since the Darkalyndar Succession War was fought, and the following decision to keep Darkalyndar as an independent ally made: circumstances have changed and at least some of the protagonists of that decision are deceased, it's time to revisit it.\nThe rulers of both nations are close relative, in good relations, but it's now needed to have the two nations together in the same hands, to avoid the risk of the nation drifting apart or worse, consuming each others in wars. Having two rulers with a valid claim on each other's title is not a good recipe for peace.\n[J72.Monarch.GetName] graciously agreed to step down and [Root.Monarch.GetName] will be the ruler of both Darkalyndar and Gophira. Positions of power will have to be exchanged, reparations given, but it is a small price to pay."
 gophira.9.1: "Two kingdoms are enough, the next crown will be for an empire."

 gophira.10.t: "Fate Comes Knocking"
 gophira.10.d1: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] could still hear from the window the tingling of a couple of swords clashing in the distance, but it was the cacophony of doors kicked open, broken windows and cries of Urvand's inhabitants that was filling [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] ears. Sounds of victory.\nThey were marching through the palace, him, Azhera as Darkalyndar's ruler, and Vindar as his chief diplomat, straight to the throne room to confront Larankar's ruler.\n[G64.Monarch.GetName] fought tooth and nail for his capital: [G64.Monarch.GetHerHim] and [Root.Monarch.GetName] dueled under the city's walls, without reaching a conclusion, both wounded and unable to continue; the pulsating pain of the deep cut [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] got in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] upper arm would persist for  months.\n\nAzhera and Vindar were arguing of course – but at least they had the decency of doing it before meeting Larankar's ruler. "They must be executed, [G64.Monarch.GetTitle] and [G64.Heir.GetTitle] both. Mercy is a weakness we can't afford, else any little warlord in Taychend will believe it's fine to defy us. They need to be an example."\n"If Olhokar had followed your example, your realm wouldn't exist, nor will ours last if we do. A magnanimous ruler will be respected everywhere my Lord, and respect goes a longer way than fear does. To rage against a defeated enemy shows only poor character.""
 gophira.10.d2: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] could still hear from the window the tingling of a couple of swords clashing in the distance, but it was the cacophony of doors kicked open, broken windows and cries of Urvand's inhabitants that was filling [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] ears. Sounds of victory. They were marching through the palace, directed to the throne room, to confront Larankar's ruler.\n[G64.Monarch.GetName] fought tooth and nail for his capital: [G64.Monarch.GetHerHim] and [Root.Monarch.GetName] dueled under the city's walls, without reaching a conclusion, both wounded and unable to continue; the pulsating pain of the deep cut [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] got in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] upper arm would persist for  months.\n\nThere was discussion among his generals on how to treat the defeated enemies: some were for heavy punishment - kill both the ruler and his heir for their defiance - others hoped the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] would be graceful in victory, and show mercy on the enemies."
 gophira.10.1: "I decree [G64.Monarch.GetName] and all [G64.Monarch.GetHerHis] direct heirs to be executed as enemies of the country."
 gophira.10.2: "[G64.Monarch.GetName], you have been a fine enemy to battle with."

 gophira.11.t: "The Third Empire"
 gophira.11.d: "First came Olokhar, and while his qualities were many big was also his flaw, so much that his own empire collapsed under it.\nSecond came Aldatam, the Reclaimer, his rise was slower but had better foundations to it. But those same foundations ended up betraying his heirs, each Great-Banner of the Ironblood Army fighting for its own pretender, following its Dannasan power games, instead of serving the state.\nThird came Harrihara, he vanquished every enemy that appeared in front of him, no matter if it had the power of a prophecy on his back or the skill to defy fate.\nThird came Harrihara, he reforged the Ironbloods anew, amending the mistakes of the past.\nThird came Harrihara,and there will not be a fourth."
 gophira.11.1: "The Cycle is over, the Empire eternal."
 gophira_stop_bad_events_tt: "We dealt with the warlords, we'll stop hearing of their attempts to gain more power."

 gophira.13.t: "Army Land Grab"
 gophira.13.d: "Some months ago a warlord-officer in our army began, using the Gophiran troops under his command, to subdue a swath of small, village-sized city states and effectively add them to his personal demesne. With the warlord merely seizing farming communities – nonetheless valuable sources of tribute – the land grab escaped our attention, and, seeing no repercussions had befallen the officer, others started following his example.\n\nSome of these copy-cats did not have the original officer’s tact – a coalition of local hero-cults, the only groups left there powerful enough to complain, have come to us outraged by the commanders abuses. Unfortunately, we do not have the strength to deal with these renegade commanders at this time – they are, after all, in charge of the very forces we would try to put them down with."
 gophira.13.1: "There's really nothing we can do."

 gophira.14.t: "Warlord Vying for the Throne"
 gophira.14.d: "One of our most prominent and respected general has in this last year repeatedly been butting head with our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], and has challenged many of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] decisions. Only his popularity among the soldiers saved him from repercussions. But you can poke a jaguar only so many times, and [Root.Monarch.GetName] was preparing to dismiss him.\n\nUnfortunately, the general learned of our plans. Interfacing with a disgruntled member of the Sangamar family, (in a disturbing retread of the very trend that had once destroyed the Second Gophiran Empire), the general then decided to depose our ruler, and place this pretender on the throne.  It seems many of his troops - OUR troops - agree with this inane notion, and have joined him in revolt."
 gophira.14.1: "Just another pretender in the end."
 gophira.14.tt: "10 units of our army in [gophira_betrayal.GetName] join the pretender."

 gophira.15.t: "Garrison Takeover of Local Workshops"
 gophira.15.d: "In the Second Gophiran Empire, the ten Great-Banners of the Ironblood Army, the field armies that secured the Empire’s rule, were garrisoned in only a few specific cities, where their power was entrenched and unassailable. This meant that the city-states under their jurisdiction could get on in peace, even while the warlords who ruled them were forced to keep one eye on the Ironblood army next door.\n\nWe do not have that luxury. Without the existentially dangerous but understandably powerful Great-Banners, we have been forced to spread our forces thinly. The garrison commanders in the capital of [gophira_army_encroaching.GetName], recognizing the amount of money to be made there, have abused their power to force many craft workshops' owners to sell their business, employing their own lackeys there in their stead. Not only is this very upsetting to the local trade guilds, but, being soldiers, they are way worse at managing the shops than the previous owners were."
 gophira.15.1: "We'll tell them to stop - but there is little we can do in practice."

 gophira.16.t: "Army Force-recruit Peasants"
 gophira.16.d1: "The army always found the mass of its recruits among common people, mostly peasants and the poorest of citizens, but it seems that with our recent drive to increase the Ironblood army size the recruiters in [gophira_forcerecruit.GetName] started going too far, forcing people usually exempted from recruitment to join the army anyway.\nFathers with many small children to feed, sons with already too many brothers in the army, peasants recruited right before harvesting time...\nThe locals have begun to harrass or hid from any official coming to their hamlets, which is hampering not only recruiting but tax and fees collection as well."
 gophira.16.d2: "Jahlor was beside himself with anger, and anguish. And yet he was marching on, through his village, away from his home, away from his two precious jewels, who will be  six years old next week, from his wife, his newborn son. Marching to go and fight against people like him, that he had no quarrel with, for people that only ever hurt him and his loved ones.\nThe warlords always had recruited in his village and other nearby ones, but, at least according to his father, there used to be unwritten rules to it. Try and have enough people home in time for the harvest, exempt fathers of young kids, the last son of two old parents, families with already too many soldiers in the army…\nTimes have changed, now the recruiters will grab everybody.\nHe shouted, pleaded, shoved the men out of his meager house, but here he was, marching. He'd want nothing more than to rebel to this injustice but, despite all his rage, he knew he was powerless, like a caged rat. Marching."
 gophira.16.1: "What can you do, we need the men."

 gophira.17.t: "New Equipment Requisition"
 gophira.17.d: "Recently our newly produced armours and weapons don't even have time to cool down before people from the army come to collect them. The spike in equipment required by our men is such that I have suspicions of corruption in our procurement chain. Either the smiths are slackening on the iron quality or somebody is selling the equipment behind our backs. Maybe some quartermaster."
 gophira.17.1: "You did well reporting to me, the higher ups don't need to know about this for now."

 gophira.18.t: "General Demand Power"
 gophira.18.d: "Another day, another warlord thinking he's special.\nOne of our generals is demanding a position as advisor on military matters in our court, for he believes his ideas will drastically improve our army.\nOf course, he require a nice stipend for that."
 gophira.18.1: "No. Let him do his worst, whatever that is."
 gophira.18.2: "I guess some of his ideas are not that bad."
