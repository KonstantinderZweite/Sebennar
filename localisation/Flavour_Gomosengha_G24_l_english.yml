 flavour_gomosengha.1.d:0 "The monks of the order of the Dolenmach hold the sacred task of raising the son of the dragon god Drozmagog. The order have secluded themselves in the mountains of Gomosengha so that no Rzentur lord may subvert the child's education for their own ends. It is well known amongst the Dolenmach that the young Dragon Prince likes breaking into the kitchen to glut himself on food while his custodians are not watching. Amongst the chefs and kitchen staff, the young prince is known as the 'Green Terror' for his antics. Unfortunately, the young dragon overheard some of the chefs while sneaking into the kitchen to get an early sample of tomorrow's lunch. Now the dragon insists that everyone refer to him as such, Varlengeilt."
