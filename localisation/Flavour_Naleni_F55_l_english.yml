 the_riches_of_yetsemira_title:0 "The Riches of Yetsemira"
 the_riches_of_yetsemira_desc:0 "Yetsemira: One of the greatest cities in all of the Mengi realms, major hub of commerce and trade, rivalled only by Dakmender for its size and wealth. Now Harpies walk her streets and patrol her skies as her rulers, a sight as strange for us as it is for the local humans. There is wealth here, seen in every fat merchant and laden ship, wealth almost beyond any single Harpies imagining, and we covet it.\n\nExtracting it will require a radical change in our usual attitudes towards rich traders. Already our port officials are reminding the Odanchesta that pull into port that they can’t raid the place anymore (necessary after one incident that left a full fifth of the piers on fire), but for the wealth to truly flow we must show it that we will be suitable custodians. Convincing the people of the justness of our rule, investing into the city and expanding our burgeoning musical arts there will renew Yetsemira as a booming centre of trade - all for the benefit of our purse, of course."


 cutthroat_diplomacy_title:0 "Cutthroat Diplomacy"
 cutthroat_diplomacy_desc:0 "Not all the neighbours are invaders. To the west Boyebareti stands proud as the last Independant Mengi nation on the Gulf Coast. Unfortunately for them, they’re in our way.  We must continue the offensive against the other Raheni colonisers, and their lands block our armies' passage westward along the coast. Whilst we could ferry troops across the waters of the Gulf and bypass Boyebareti lands entirely, doing so would expose us to the same supply vulnerabilities we have been so neatly exploiting in our foe. Perhaps a ‘civilised’ people would simply negotiate military passage, but our ‘monstrous’ reputation does us no favours in this regard. Not that the fools in Boyebareti would deal with us either way, the Mengi have many choice words for outsiders and they have long considered us a foe. No matter the enmity between us, we will go through them.\n\nSome ‘pragmatic diplomacy’ is called for. Humans have monsters too, and by utilising our criminal connections within Boyebareti, smugglers, thieves, pirates, we can fabricate a pretence for invasion with a support network already in place. Once the area is under our control, there will be no more obstacles to the rest of the coast."

 serenade_our_subjects_title:0 "Serenade our Subjects"
 serenade_our_subjects_desc:0 "Dancing, cheering, drinking. These are not the activities that being near a training hall for fearsome Nalénian Sirens should evoke, and yet our experiences in Tefegben prove otherwise. The local Metebesebi defy all logic in their reactions to our deathly warriors presence and practice, seeing it as entertainment and the song as an unexpected benefit of Harpy rule. \n\nAs strange as this behaviour is, we are nothing if not practical. The Ofehibi humans we now rule in the former lands of Boyebareti have been proving more unruly, and the Matriarch has decided to see whether they respond the same way as their Metobesebi cousins to our Sirens presence. We shall construct a number of new songhalls throughout the region and disperse sirens amongst them, in an attempt at pacification."

 along_the_coast_title:0 "Along the Coast"
 along_the_coast_desc:0 "At last, the colonial heartland of the Raheni is in sight. Here along the Ofehibi coast is where their incursion first began, where they first made landfall, taking Dakmender as their prize. Where it began, and where it shall end. Our prior conquests have taught us the recipe for a successful occupation. Once the coast has been ‘liberated’ from Raheni hands, we will establish our songhalls and begin the pacification of the local Mengi. The Metobesebi have so far proved to be the most amenable to our rule, and so by promoting their cultural values over the other Mengi peoples we can solidify our rule. \n\nThe independent Odanchésta will no doubt be disgruntled by the end of the Raheni shipping and the subsequent drop in trade to plunder, but no matter. A monopoly on the Mengi coast will force all trade through our ports, making us far far richer in the long run. Why work for our gold when it could simply come to us?"

 all_hands_on_deck_title:0 "All Hands on Deck"
 all_hands_on_deck_desc:0 "When the Raheni first invaded Sarhal, we were salivating. Gems, ivory, gold, all packed onto ships and sailed back to Rahen - it was a buffet, a feast for hungry pirates. The independent Odanchésta still see it this way, they have grown fat and lazy preying on Rahen’s scraps. \nThe Matriarch knows better. \nIn the decade since the invasion first began, we have been surrounded, and now Rahen eyes our lands too. All whilst the Raheni have grown wealthy beyond the wildest dreams of any Harpy. They must be resisted, our hands brought to arms, and perhaps the flow of wealth reversed..."

 repel_boarders_title:0 "Repel Boarders"
 repel_boarders_desc:0 "The Iyarhashari threaten us from the south. Their conquest of Berihrica and Pegosi represents an existential threat to our rule over the coast, they and the rest of their ilk loathe our raids - and for good reason. Any attempt to deal with the threat of Rahen must begin with them.\n\nWe shall sweep south, burn their outposts, kill their soldiers and throw them back into the sea. Then when we’re done, we’ll sail after them and take their riches back as our own - a small taste of the future to come."

 a_southern_roost_title:0 "A Southern Roost"
 a_southern_roost_desc:0 "Not since the days of Siadenlen, long before we came to Sarhal, have we ruled over so many humans as now. Our campaign against the Raheni has put many many more humans under our dominion, and already the gaps in our means of rule are beginning to show. Without the presence of Harpies nearby the local humans seem to almost forget they’ve been conquered!\n\nThe Matriarch has a plan to alleviate this by constructing a new roost in our southern lands, along with a new songhall for our Sirens. Relocating some of our people there will enable us to project control over the region, benevolently giving the local humans the privilege of being chosen to serve as husbands. Not to mention listening to our beautiful melodies."

 land_ho_title:0 "Land Ho"
 land_ho_desc:0 "Rahen, the land of the Raj, the porcelain cities, ivory, silks and slaves. Boundless wealth can be found here, trickling down the Kharunyana into the Gulf. The wealthy Raheni trade states think this wealth is their birthright, the fruits of their lands. They see Sarhal as little more than a resource pit, a continent ripe for exploitation. How wrong they are. \n\nThe first step in our plan shall be establishing a beachhead in Rahen, a little colony of our own to serve as a gateway for further expansion, and enable us to begin to syphon the wealth of Rahen back to Sarhal."

 conclave_of_captains_title:0 "Conclave of Captains"
 conclave_of_captains_desc:0 "It is time to resolve our divisions. This conflict between Odanchés and Matriarch can not continue any longer, the strife stifles our ambitions. Effort spent in appeasing our own is effort not spent externally, and the Odanchestas incessant squabbling drains the attention and resources of our state.\n\nWe shall hold a conclave, every independent Odanchés of note shall be summoned to attend a meeting with the Matriarch and her entire clan in the capitol. Here we shall hash out our differences peacefully. Afterall, are we not all Nalénian?"

 the_sirens_title:0 "The Sirens"
 the_sirens_desc:0 "Singing on our ships has long been an important way of raising morale and keeping work in rhythm. Some amongst us however have discovered that song can be much more than that, and have worked to hone their song into a potent weapon. Many a human sailor has last heard an entrancing tune before a Siren descends upon them, stupefying them even as their ship is raided. Others hear deathly shrieks that split the eardrum and cut to the core, making the hardiest of hands drop their blades in fear and shock. \n\nCountless Iyarhashari invaders learnt these facts through first hand experience in our recent war, and the Matriarch has taken notice of their effectiveness as a combat unit. We shall begin to formalise the Sirens as an elite unit by constructing a specialised training area funded by the Matriarch. This will provide us with a new source of quality soldiers, ones with the helpful feature of being uniquely loyal to the Matriarchy."

 raiding_bases_title:0 "Raiding Ports"
 raiding_bases_desc:0 "It is more apparent than ever that our command over the sea is our strength. As our mainland ports have multiplied so too has our fleet, both that of the Matriarchy and the independent Odanchésta who owe us their allegiance, however our expansion has created a new issue. Odanchésta now whine to the Matriarch about slender pickings in our home waters, forcing them to travel further afield for the same chance at plunder, all caused by the reduction in Raheni shipping. \n\nThe Matriarch could of course not care less about the purses of these unruly rebels, but they do raise a real problem. Since settling in Sarhal much of our economy has been based on the lucrative gold stream of piracy, and without new sources of plunder we risk falling destitute as a nation. Luckily the gulf has no shortage of riches to loot, we simply need to access them. By building new ports on islands throughout the Gulf we can extend the range of our raiders, unlocking new coasts ripe for pillaging."

 repurpose_the_slave_port_title:0 "Repurpose the Slave Port"
 repurpose_the_slave_port_desc:0 "The wandering Harimari of Vandipa were long a thorn on our coast. Slavers through and through, their ships sought to contest ours in our very home waters to ensure the safety of their shipping. Not that we even wanted to raid their dingy rat infested boats - slaves are terrible plunder, they eat all the food and are impossible to sell smoothly. \n\nTheir island however is quite the little prize, well developed and full of wealth made off the back of said slave trade, not to mention well positioned off the mainland coast. Now that it belongs to us, it can be put to more appropriate use. Vandipa will be no mere raiding port however, it shall serve us as a gateway to the southern isles, the slaving infrastructure repurposed to colonial ends. Once the Harimari are gone, that is."

 pillage_and_plunder_title:0 "Pillage and Plunder"
 pillage_and_plunder_desc:0 "The humans have a saying, “it's important to remember your roots”. \n\nNo matter how we might advance or who and where we might conquer, at heart we are pirates. Pillage and plunder is in our blood, the thrill of a raid is something every Nalénian has felt, the sway of a ship on the waves, the rush of looting, the satisfaction of a grand haul. These things call to us, and we will never forget them, or our heritage. \n\nWe must make sure the rest of the Gulf doesn't either."

 new_fleets_title:0 "New Fleets"
 new_fleets_desc:0 "As our domain grows, so too do our needs. Patrolling every inch of coast has become a much more arduous task with our recent expansion, and the development of our new raiding ports has opened many new ‘markets’ for our ships. Our influence and control over the gulf is growing immensely, and to retain that control our fleets must grow in kind."

 new_bases_title:0 "New Bases"
 new_bases_desc:0 "Land, ports, fleets - our expansion continues and with it comes new opportunities. There are many ‘uninhabited’ islands in the southern seas, islands we and other pirates have frequented in the past, ones used as havens to stash treasure and rest. These islands, both the twilight and Ringlet isles, will serve as excellent platforms for our continued naval expansion, allowing our ships the range to raid along the Vimdatrong and Tanizu coasts.\n\nOf course there are rivals that lay claim to some of these isles already, the pirates of Pinghoi in particular. Foolish Yansheni, so far from home, who think the waters are their hunting ground. We shall have to show them who is truly the prey."

 the_great_songhall_of_yetsemira_title:0 "The Great Songhall"
 the_great_songhall_of_yetsemira_desc:0 "As the Sirens become Semayabaka and song fills the air of our nation, our people, harpy and human like, only ever crave more. Our songhall-temples are spacious, but none is particularly grander than the other, and our most accomplished Sirens and other performers are clamouring for a platform worthy of their skill, one that will draw audiences from across the realm and even further. Private interests have already built some arenas for non-siren performers, but it would not be proper for our elite to be performing in such spaces. Thus we must provide. Yetsemira has become something of a cultural capital in the time since we first developed it, and there we shall build our grand Songhall."

 song_for_the_people_title:0 "Music for the Masses"
 song_for_the_people_desc:0 "If the Conclave Tragedy has taught us anything, it's that loyalty is a precious thing. If our own people can betray the Matriarchy, then what of the humans we rule? Do they go to bed at night plotting treason too? \n\nFear is how we have ruled in the past, fear of raids, fear of the hunt, fear of our Sirens, but perhaps there is another way. Perhaps loyalty, however precious, can be made. We have seen how the humans enjoy our song, how they pay their hard won coin just for the chance to see our Sirens perform, enthralled by their beauty and voice. There is only one thing the Humans seem to pay more reverence to, their God, and this is a connection that is exploitable. We shall begin to put on religious services for the humans, combining our song with their faith into hymns, establishing ourselves as a part of it - integral to the faith. \n\n For an avian race the Sky Domain faith is rather flattering..."

 harpy_homelands_title:0 "Harpy Homelands"
 harpy_homelands_desc:0 "The Telekenid mountain range has been our home for over four hundred years. Its lofty heights and rocky precipices made it feel like it was made for us, even to those first Harpies who fled the fall of Siaden and arrived here. But our mountains stretch much further than the territory that we control, even after our conquest. They run deep into madriamilak, encompassing a full third of the Mengi realm. \n\nAny Empire must establish a firm grip over its core territories, so we shall sweep across the mountains and replace the humans who think they rule here. Then to cement our dominance we shall build our statues amongst the rock, far higher than humans could ever hope to build, so they may look up and remember we are closest to the skies."

 from_above_to_those_beneath_title:0 "From Above, to below"
 from_above_to_those_beneath_desc:0 "Conquest of the Telekenid has cemented our rule over a full third of madriamilak, and an almost countless amount of the Mengi. Cementing our rule through utilising faith has been an incredibly expedient policy for us so far, our Sirens have begun to develop into a true priest class of their own right supplementing the existing Semayabaka, and humans in our realm pay deference to them. Worship of Amilak through song has spread somewhat beyond our borders, whilst many harpies have even begun converting to Sky Domain in earnest, seeing the natural appeal in a faith of the sky. \n\nWhether the Matriarchy itself adopts Sky Domain as its faith in truth is irrelevant, what matters is that spreading our ways of worship helps us consolidate our control over our new subjects. Thus we shall expand the Sirens' influence, constructing our Songhall-temples throughout the Telekenid, providing a unity of faith the Mengi have not seen since the days of Zenidir and Melakmengi."

 a_new_kind_of_mezhimezhi_title:0 "A new kind of Mezhi'Mezhi"
 a_new_kind_of_mezhimezhi_desc:0 "The Mengi realms have not seen unity since the days of Melakmengi, the empire of the great dragon Zenidir. In those times he was known as Mezhi’Mezhi, king of kings or ruler of rulers, and such a mantle has not been held before or since. \n\nThe prosperity we have ushered into the Telekenid and the increasing importance of Sky Domain in our realm has led to many of our subjects calling for us to attempt to unify Amilak’s domain once more, harpies and humans alike. In particular Siren Semayabaka, true converts to Sky Domain, have been pushing for the state to act, claiming that our people have been chosen by Amilak to restore his realm. \n\nBe it Amilak’s will or not, we shall unify Mengi again. In the Senidmot crater, grave of the dragon, we shall build a new throne and proclaim our monarch Mezhi’Mezhi, Queen of Queens - equal to Zenidir himself!"

 crush_the_mutineers_title:0 "Crush the Mutineers"
 crush_the_mutineers_desc:0 "To secure our reformed state we must be efficient and ruthless. The rebels must be crushed wherever they appear, their forces disintegrated like we have done to so many others already. Though it is painful to spill the blood of our own, they forfeited any kinship when they turned against the Matriarchy. The deaths of our former Matriarch and her entire clan are on their hands, bodies so reduced to ash that we could not even sail them to their final rest. Only once they are defeated will our new monarchy be secure. Only once they are crushed will this wrong be righted."

 privateers_not_pirates_title:0 "Privateers, not Pirates"
 privateers_not_pirates_desc:0 "So called ‘civilised’ peoples are eminently confusing. They engage in much the same behaviour on the seas as we, raiding shipping lanes and trade convoys, yet when confronted they produce tiny slips of paper signed by their rulers with a scribble that they claim makes them a “privateer”, not a pirate.\n\nAs ridiculous a precedent as this may be, it can be of great use to us. By formalising privateering and granting licence to Odanchesta from the Queen to act as privateers, we can tie their loyalty firmly to the state. Any Odanchesta acting out of line will be disavowed and denied access to our ports, absolving us of responsibility for them and creating incentive to keep them in line."

 a_new_naleni_title:0 "A New Naléni"
 a_new_naleni_desc:0 "Naléni shall be reborn under our Queendom, no longer rent apart by division, no longer a monstrous realm on the edge of civilization. We have already proven our might through our conquests, and proven our resilience through our internal struggles. The only thing left to prove is our Majesty. \n\nWe will construct a grand palace, a monument to the Queen that has led us through this time of trouble. From there, we shall make the humans, the harimari, and all others who question take notice. Naléni the pirate haven no more, now and henceforth; Ríva Naléni, proud empire of the Gulf!"

 across_the_gulf_title:0 "Across the Gulf"
 across_the_gulf_desc:0 "Our state is secure, our armies and fleets ready. The dreams of the Matriarchy will be realised, we shall sail across the Gulf and claim the coasts of Rahen as our own, a mocking mirror of their own actions. We shall say we are there for justice, for revenge or whatever the like, but the truth is we go to Rahen for gold. As the riches flow back to Sarhal their merchants will come to curse the day they ever crossed the Gulf."

 to_rule_the_sea_title:0 "To Rule the Sea"
 to_rule_the_sea_desc:0 "“Power comes from the point of a sword and the barrel of a cannon.” - Queen Ríva of Naléni \n\nBeneath the false smiles and shook hands of diplomacy, the paper and ink of bureaucracy, the world runs on might. To rule our Empire, now stretching across two continents and the seas between, we must have might comparable to our glory. \n\nOur fleets and army both must expand to capacity, available resources put into training and construction efforts so that our will may be felt on every shore of the Gulf. The Sirens too must be expanded even further, their martial traditions not neglected even despite their growing role in the Mengi Faith. To rule the sea there must be nowhere that the Naléni flag might not be seen over the horizon."

 the_heart_of_rahens_trade_title:0 "The Heart of Rahens Trade"
 the_heart_of_rahens_trade_desc:0 "The wealth of Rahen is centred in the gulf, the lands around the Kharunyana estuary and along the coast. More than just Rahen in fact it is the heart of all Halesses trade, a wealth beyond any other in the continent, nay all of Halann.\n\nAlready our talons grasp it, our territory there extensive, but the grip must tighten. As veins supply a heart, so too does the rest of Haless feed the Gulf, the gold from distant Shamarkand and Yanshen running with the waters there. To control the heart, we must control the veins. We shall take control of the trade along the coast and own the wealth of a continent."

 the_naleni_gulf_title:0 "The Naléni Gulf"
 the_naleni_gulf_desc:0 "A new age is dawning.\n\nNever before has an Empire spread so far as to rule Rahen and Madramilak in tandem. Never before have such heights been reached, peoples of disparate cultures and beliefs brought together under one flag - our flag.\n\nBesides our authority there is only one thing that unifies our realm, one thing that allows our reach to stretch so far - the Gulf. Our beloved home sea, the taste of its salty waters forever on the lips of each Nalénian. Our sea has long been known as the Gulf of Rahen, reflective of the Raheni’s disproportionate influence over it, but no longer. To crown our new age our Gulf shall have a new, better name - the Naléni Gulf, a name enforced by our utter hegemony."

 professionalise_the_sirens_title:0 "Professionalise the Sirens"
 professionalise_the_sirens_desc:0 "Until now our armies have been ragtag bands of harpy warriors together in loose organisation only, serving the matriarchy out of no true loyalty, fighting with ferocity and courage, but no real discipline or order. The Sirens are something of an exception, fiercely loyal to the Matriarch, now Throne, but even they have been more of a levy force, each hall its own unit, with a lack of overarching structure. \n\nThis must change, and it shall start with the Sirens. Queen Ríva’s ideas will serve as our plans for the new Sirens, a fully professional force, a true elite standing army. One that our foes will quake to see descend upon them, transfixed by song and unable to react as our wings block the sun."

 further_afield_title:0 "Further Afield"
 further_afield_desc:0 "Naval logistics are always difficult, given it involves managing thousands of moving pieces on a surface that itself shifts, but they are immensely easier when there exists the state apparatus to properly catalogue items: bases, ships, and supplies. The centralisation of our state and the transformation of our pirate flotillas into a real stratified navy has thus unlocked the potential to extend our influence far beyond our current waters, now that our logistical capability can support such expansion. \n\nThe waters of Bamaliwuni and Yanshen will soon come to know the sight of our flag upon the masts of our ships. Know it and fear it."

 beyond_the_stormwall_title:0 "Beyond the Stormwall"
 beyond_the_stormwall_desc:0 "The great storm has parted, beyond it a vast new continent. A continent untouched by the larger world, a continent with wealth to be had. Though Insyaa is large, our preliminary exploration has revealed an area to the north of the continent that features a large archipelago. This extensive chain of islands appears to be predominantly inhabited by groups of humans, and there is existing extensive maritime trade. \n\nWere we still pirates, this discovery would have begun a new golden age of piracy. Given that we are now much more respectable privateers, instead it shall begin a new golden age of privateering. The Empire shall move its navy into the region to claim dominance over the trade here, a much appreciated source of new revenue. Bases will be required in order for the fleet to operate so far from our home waters, luckily there are many smaller islands in the region that would be ideal locations."

 an_insyaan_capitol_title:0 "An Insyaan Capitol"
 an_insyaan_capitol_desc:0 "Kanolowele has proven to be a particularly fruitful region for our expansion, however its distance from the core of our Empire is still causing issues. The long trip over the seas makes communication slow even when sending messages via our fastest clippers, with magical communication being the only real viable means of quick connection. \n\nThis results in many logistical and operational issues, with our bases in Insyaa having to act as functionally autonomous for large periods. Clearly this state of affairs cannot continue if we want to expand our influence in the region further. In order to remedy this, we shall embrace the idea of local authority and construct a capitol building from which delegates may exercise rule of the region. Delegates sent from the capital of course. The volcano of Muatlaqua, sacred to the local faiths, will serve as a perfect location."

 naleni.1.t:0 "Charting the Course"
 naleni.1.d:0 "The nation of Naléni is a mess. A crude amalgamation of a pirate republic and a traditional harpy matriarchy, factional politics divide the realm and jam any sort of consensus, making exercising central authority extremely difficult. Power is split between the Matriarchy itself, led by the Nepieuda dynasty, and the various independent Odanchésta, pirate captains in common, themselves arranged in a loose and often fractious coalition united only in resisting the authority of the Matriarchy.\n\nPeace in the realm is maintained by a historic compromise known as the Muréda Accord, so named for the Matriarch who negotiated its terms. Under it the Matriarch retains formal authority, but a co-ruler is ‘elected’ from amongst the ranks of the Odanchésta every four years to serve as Ídar Odanchés, or Dread Captain, a quasi-military ruler who shares power with the Matriarch. These elections are less voting, and more candidates scrambling for the most muscle to support them.\n\nThe accord has served Naléni well until now due to the lack of outside threats, given its isolation on the edge of the Great Horn, but it has begun to fray with the arrival of the Raheni colonisers. The Matriarchy stirs as it sees its realm under threat, whilst the Odanchésta enjoy the bounty of plundering Raheni trade, the two groups' combined interests dwindling.\n\nThe current Matriarch's daughter, Bimogire, has just been elected Ídar Odanchés, providing a rare moment of semi-unity. Despite this, it will take a careful hand to steer the ship of state; bolstering the Matriarchys authority whilst balancing the interests of the Odanchésta."
 L55_naleni.1_tt:0 "Enables the §YMatriarch Authority§! mechanic. Elections and events will provide the opportunity to affect the level of §YMatriarch Authority§! which ranges from §RLow§! to §GHigh§!. The mission §YConclave of Captains§! will disable the mechanic and afterwards grant a different powerful scaling modifier based on its level at the time."
 naleni.1.a:0 "We sail onwards."
 naleni.2.t:0 "Tensions"
 naleni.2.d:0 "A cold wind cuts across the mountainside hall, the faint hint of salt water carried on it.\n\nUpon a rudimentary throne the Matriarch sits, stolen from a displaced human ruler and carried by a team of harpies up here to the cliffside roost some centuries ago. Opposite stands a Odanchés defiant, eyes cast up towards the throne with no deference, the curved blade a shotel upon their hip a visual affront to the Matriarchs authority. Even the magnificent stone statue carved in the wall behind, a grand monument to a ruler past, causes nary the bat of an eye.\n\nOther harpies line the walls of the hall. Half bear the flag of the Matriarch, the flag of Naléni itself, upon their armour. The rest have no semblance of similarity at all, bright colours patched over dull, tattered clothes held together by repeated needlework, the coarse uniforms of sailors.\n\n“You overstep!” The Odanchés shrieks, shrill and irreverent tone eliciting uncomfortable shifting about the room. “We’ve been living this way for centuries, and now you want us to fight, to go to war? We haven’t warred since Siádenlen fell! Our home is the sea, why fight Rahen, why care about humans?”\n\n“Our home is here, where we make our Roosts.” the Matriarch replies, rising from her throne. “None love the sea more than I, but a people cannot live upon boats. It is not for love of humans, but need of them. You forget your place, Odanchés.”  The word is full of venom, and silence hangs over the hall for a moment. \n\n“Get out of my sight.”\n\nThe Odanchés spits on the sunbleached stone, hand twitching atop the hilt of their Shotel, but they simply whirl about face, launching into the air and departing, their followers taking suit. As they leave, the cold wind cuts again."
 naleni.2.a:0 "A worrying encounter."
 naleni.3.t:0 "The Matriarchs Desk - New Lands, New Loot?"
 naleni.3.d:0 "A map of the southern lands stretches out across the table, the recently conquered territories of Naléni marked in green, with several red crosses along the coast. An advisor tells you these mark the site of raids, raids by our people on what is now our land - and our wealth."
 naleni.3.a:0 "Pay off the Odanchésta to stop their raids."
 naleni.3.b:0 "Let them raid, they'll get bored eventually."
 naleni.4.t:0 "The Matriarchs Desk - Ofehibi Pirates"
 naleni.4.d:0 "A message has arrived, on a scroll reeking of salt and cheap ale.\n\nIt comes from a group of the Odanchésta. Whilst the Matriarchy has been infiltrating Boyebaretti, they’ve been doing their own roguery, and have a proposal - a deal with the local human pirates. In exchange for a complete right to continue their raiding, as well as use our ports, they offer to swear absolute fealty and assist in our takeover."
 naleni.4.a:0 "No deals with the competition, we mustn't surrender our authority."
 naleni.4.b:0 "Their loyalty is too valuable to refuse."
 naleni.5.t:0 "To our Tune"
 naleni.5.d:0 "The sun in Tefegeben beats down heavy upon the domed roof of the song hall, glistening rays reflecting off the smooth tiling, a stark contrast to the thatched huts all around. Inside the Sirens train, blade and talon put to good use in relentless drill, voices warmed and tested; honed into a weapon as sharp as any other.\n\nOutside there is no hint of the danger that lives within, none except the music that slips free from window and door, loud enough to be heard all throughout the square where the hall resides.\n\nCurious humans hear the voices and stop, as if transfixed. Many gather to listen, sitting and taking in the song. Haunting melodies bring tears, whilst joyous tunes bring cheers, as if the sounds were not a hymn to death."
 naleni.5.a:0 "Some are even dancing."

 naleni.6.t:0 "The Matriarchs Desk - Odanchésta request Priority Docking"
 naleni.6.d:0 "A missive lands on the desk, rough parchment splotted red - no doubt from a carelessly split wine.\n\nThe broken wax seal atop bears the crest of the Odanchésta coalition. In it is a surprisingly polite message complimenting the new ports, along with a request for priority access. They promise a fair sum of gold in exchange."
 naleni.6.a:0 "They can wait like everyone else."
 naleni.6.b:0 "Well, if they're paying."
 naleni.7.t:0 "The Matriarchs Desk - The Art of Song"
 naleni.7.d:0 "A pristine bleached parchment lies on the desk, placed there by the hand of a close advisor.\n\nThe humans have become so enraptured with our Sirens that they have begun paying their hard won gold in order to listen to the performances up close. Our expanding songhalls have spread this new business across the realm, and inspired by the Siren’s example many harpies have begun turning away from the sea and taking up singing as a profession.\n\nThis has led to a shortage of recruits for the ships, and in response the Odanchésta have been press ganging foreign sailors into their crews - creating ever more disloyal and disruly groups causing trouble in our ports."
 naleni.7.a:0 "We should divert some Sirens to their crews to keep them in line."
 naleni.7.b:0 "It sounds like they have the recruitment issue well in hand."
 naleni.8.t:0 "The Matriarchs Desk - Complaints from the Odanchésta"
 naleni.8.d:0 "A heap of letters and scrolls of all shapes and sizes lie in a heap. Aside from the pile lie two documents both written in clearly hasty hands.\n\nEach message in the heap is the same, complaint after complaint about our expansion along the Ofehibi coast. Raheni shipping has dropped precipitously and the Odanchesta are going hungry without their prey.\n\nThe documents set aside are far more pressing than the rest of the rubbish. Reports from the garrisons of Biribitid and Dakmender telling of Odanchesta crews openly rioting in the streets and looting the cities."
 naleni.8.a:0 "Remind them who rules."
 naleni.8.b:0 "Maybe we should join in..."
 naleni.9.t:0 "The Matriarchs Desk - Murmurs of Discontent"
 naleni.9.d:0 "A neat and tidy small folded paper waits on the desk, its words written in the spy-mistresses' careful hand.\n\nOur conquest of lands in Rahen have set rumours circling the court. Disgruntled Odanchésta huddle in dark corners amongst seedy taprooms in ports across the coast. Whispers of rebellion flit from ear to ear, voices rasp that the matriarchy has betrayed the Odanchésta."
 naleni.9.a:0 "Hunt down these dissenters."
 naleni.9.b:0 "I'm sure its nothing."
 naleni.10.t:0 "A Pirates Life"
 naleni.10.d:0 "A good roost, a sturdy ship, strong mates and a huge heap of gold. Is there anything more a harpy could want in the world?"
 naleni.10.a:0 "There's always more gold!"
 naleni.11.t:0 "The Conclave"
 naleni.11.d:0 "A lone harpy stands against a palace balcony, raised up high on the rock face above the distant city below. Lights twinkle there against the twilight sky, distant flames flickering in the cool evening breeze. Hours ago the Matriarch and the rest of the clan left for the conclave, making the flight below to the designated meeting space. Now Ríva waits alone, the only Nepieuda in the roost. All is quiet around aside from the slosh of wine in Riva’s glass, the sounds of the city too far to be heard. This meeting will decide the fate of the clan, the fate of the dynasty, the fate of Naléni itself.\n\nA sudden crack splits the air.\n\nRoaring noise bellows, waves of heat blasting upwards. A huge fireball illuminates the dark below, centred on the meeting place. Ríva stares wordlessly, hands gripped tight to the stone railing. As the fireball diminishes a plume of smoke rises from the charred remains of the conclave, ashes all that is left of the dreams of peace.\n\nIn the dying orange light black flags rise in the harbour, visible only with an avian eye. They flutter in the wind, mocking and triumphant, as the ships pull away. \n\nRíva screams.\n\nNot out of anguish, but anger. Retribution. Into the night, after those fleeing ships, Ríva screams a promise of justice. Ten seconds, then a deep breath, and a pivot back inside. The Nephieuda dynasty will not end here. She will not allow it. Naléni will not fall to these mutineers. The Matriarch may be dead, but the Matriarchy lives on. The Sirens will answer her, the fleets will come at her call, and EVERY Nalénian shall bow before the queen - else she shall make them."
 naleni.11.a:0 "MUTINY!"
 naleni.12.t:0 "Mutineers sail on the Capital!"
 naleni.12.d:0 "The attacks come swiftly. Reports continue to rush in, mutineer crews assaulting provinces all across Naléni. This is no rogue act of terror, no. It's a coordinated attack, a strike against the very foundations of the confederation, and now they come for our very seat of power.\n\nThese rogue Odanchésta want nothing more than our nation's end, to see us washed away by the tide. They will not succeed!"
 naleni.12.a:0 "Death to the Mutineers!"
 naleni.13.t:0 "Justice"
 naleni.13.d:0 "The mountainside hall is quiet, save for the steady rap of fingers on stone.\n\nQueen Ríva sits atop a newly hewn marble throne, carried to this height by a whole team of harpies, her fingers tapping rhythmically on the arm. The walls are lined with Sirens, identifiable through the bright blue crest adorning their armour, the spread wings of the Nephieuda. On the stone floor beneath the dias, bound in irons and forced into supplication, kneel the two ringleaders of the mutineers. Traitorous Odanchésta who first incited the revolt, the ones who plotted, the ones who butchered. Above the throne Muréda’s stone gaze bores down upon the destroyers of her peace.\n\nThe hall awaits the Queen's sentence, but Ríva is unsure. These two killed her family. The blood might as well still be on their hands, perhaps it would be, had they not all burned. As a daughter, she sees only one option. Punishment.\n\nBut the Queen's eye differs from the daughters. Traitors they may be, but undeniably useful. Some of the finest commanders she’d ever seen in fact, an asset to her new state - an asset to her ambition. Maybe then, another option. Pardon. Though conditional, of course.\n\nThe hall's quiet continues, save for that steady rap of fingers on stone. What shall her choice be?"
 naleni.13.a:0 "There can be no mercy. Punishment."
 naleni.13.b:0 "May service redeem them. Pardon."
 naleni.14.t:0 "Parent of the People."

 naleni.14.a:0 "Sirens make good sounds"
 naleni.15.t:0 "A Queen Ascendant"
 naleni.15.d:0 "The noon sun shines strong in the sky, rays of light illuminating the palace and city below. By the same balcony where her life once changed forever Ríva stands again.\n\nWings tucked neatly behind her she leans forward. Sharp eyes survey her domain as the winds whistle against the cliffside, carrying up the scent of the sea below. All below is Naléni, as it has been four centuries since, as it will be four centuries hence. She has seen to that.\n\nShe taps her fingers gently on the edge of the balcony, staring down at the city. Ships stream in and out of the port, all now bearing Naléni’s flag - her flag. The sound of Siren song carries faintly on the wind even up to this distant height, and with an avian eye she can see even the humans crowding down outside the songhall way below.\n\nBut it's not enough.\n\nRíva’s gaze rises, up across the crystal blue waters of the Naléni pass, out and over the Gulf itself, towards far Rahen. The treasure and splendours that lie there, silks and porcelain and gold, all the wealth of Haless itself. It all calls to her.\n\nA wry smile graces her lips. This must be how the Raheni felt as they first looked south. But Naléni’s conquest, her conquest, need not end with Rahen. Already some in her realm call to expand inland, Sky Domain convert Sirens preach that Madriamilak must be unified, and there are many harpies in the Telekenid not yet united with their kin.\n\nNaléni is a nation of the sea, but its heritage is one of empire. Madriamilak and Rahen both shall fall beneath the shadow of our wing. So decides Ríva, Empress of the Gulf."
 naleni.15.a:0 "We have risen, now it is time to soar."
 naleni.16.t:0 "Enchanting rule"
 naleni.16.d:0 "To walk the roads of Ríva Naléni without hearing singing is a feat only the deaf are capable of, and even they can't help but notice it from time to time. Music in the air near songhalls creates vibrations so strong they can be felt deep in the chest, much as the sound can be felt in the soul.\n\nThough it is the Sirens who began the spread of our ways throughout the Telekenid, synchronising song and sky, the humans under our rule have come to see not only them as spiritual guides, but all of our kind. Throughout our land harpy and human now live harmoniously, the humans paying their rightful deference to us. In turn, their faith has spread amongst us, and many harpies feel a genuine duty to their human flocks, a genuine faith in those same beliefs.\n\nSong extends far beyond the confines of faith however, whilst a hymn may be the most common thing to come to ear singing has become far more than that, entertainment, an industry, a true cultural cornerstone. From the humblest of lullabies to the grandest of shows, singing ties our people together. It keeps them happy. It keeps them in line."
 naleni.16.a:0 "Our authority is irresistable."
 naleni.17.t:0 "On the Dragons Throne"
 naleni.17.d:0 "In the south of the Sendimot crater, where once was covered with half buried chunks of damestear, now stands a great palace. Its white marble walls, lined with sheets of emerald, glisten under the clear skies. Out of it rises a grand spire, one so vast as if it were made to pierce the heavens. Harpies circle it constantly, messengers, soldiers, Sirens, all wearing the blue and orange of Naléni. On the ground beneath humans mill, Mengi treading without fear in the once cursed crater. From atop the spire juts a backless throne, carved of a block of onyx, carried up by wing and will. Upon it Empress $MONARCH$ sits, seemingly content in their dominion.\n\nAs far as the eye can see is Madriamilak. As far as the eye can see is Ríva Naléni.\n\nBelow the Sirens sing, hymns to Amilak filling the air as the humans join in, celebrating the unity of Madriamilak, the restoration of the holy realm, and the great Mezhi’Mezhi who achieved it all. All is well, and yet $MONARCH$ feels unease.\n\nThe people proclaim her Amilak’s steward, a role that only a dragon has held before, a position she took with glee - a useful tool to legitimise her rule. Yet now there is doubt. Is it right to claim to serve a God one is not sure they believe in? Does she rule for herself, or Amilak? Did Zenidir have these doubts too? Or did he believe, as those below do. \n\nShe looks skyward, as if Amilak might provide her an answer himself, but alas she sees naught but the endless blue."
 naleni.17.a:0 "We rule in our own name."
 naleni.17.b:0 "We are Amilaks stewards!"
 naleni.18.t:0 "Ambition Fulfilled"
 naleni.18.d:0 "The city of Sramaya stretches before $MONARCH$. Here the mighty Kharunyana and Dhenbasana rivers meet and merge together to flow out into the bay, whilst across the estuary the great brass dome of the palace gleams, a group of Sirens sat upon its roof. There is life here, perhaps more so than in any other city in Rahen. Merchants and traders mingle amongst the squares, promises pass lips and coins cross hands with every exchange, goods borne by ship and caravan flow through the gates as freely as the rivers run.\n\nOnce her ancestor Bimogíre dreamed of these streets - though rather than standing amidst the winding paths as their mistress Bimogíre no doubt pictured herself leading a crew of pillaging odangánthu. But Sramaya need not fear Ríva Nalénian raids anymore, not whilst the blue and orange flag flies above the city, harpies fly her skies and loyal Mengi patrol her streets.\n\n$MONARCH$ smiles. Soon the sound of song will fill the air, so loud perhaps it may even drown out the merchants' laments - for undoubtedly they will wail as their wealth wafts away, sent south to Sarhal. Sramaya is safe now, firmly in our grasp, but a heart it is no longer, now just another vein."
 naleni.18.a:0 "No longer just a dream, but a reality."
 naleni.19.t:0 "Sea and Sky"
 naleni.19.d:0 "The waters of the gulf lay calm, a tranquil blue mirror of the sky above.\n\nShips of all sizes down from the smallest sloop up to the largest barque cross the expanse without fear, the valuable wares and coinage contained in their holds unmolested. The finest goods: silk and porcelain, ivory and incense, right down to the mundanest of necessities: grain and lumber, iron and nails - all pass safely across the gulf. The black flag is an exceedingly rare sight, whilst the once feared blue and orange, always just over the horizon, now brings not dread in its onlookers, but reassurance. Provided they have paid their dues of course.\n\nAshore, the peoples of two continents know the grace of our rule. They enjoy the safety we supply, the curved roofs of our songhalls present in every settlement, providing not just security but entertainment too. Song the unifying principle soothing the tensions these disparate peoples: the Mengi, content to be one under Amilak’s chosen Mezhi’Mezhi, the Raheni, free of their castes and harimari overlords.\n\nAll along the mountains of the Great Horn, the statues of our ancestors will watch our waters forevermore."
 naleni.19.a:0 "The world lies in the shadow of our wings."
 naleni.20.t:0 "The Matriarchs Desk - Street Brawls"
 naleni.20.d:0 "A missive from a port garrison waits, square and rigid with a wax seal.\n\nCracking the seal reveals the contents, a report from the docks about a fight. Two rival crews have gotten into a dispute after drinking in the same bar, and both Odanchés are loudly blaming the other for the disturbance."
 naleni.20.a:0 "Punish both Crews."
 naleni.20.b:0 "Let them both off."
 naleni.21.t:0 "The Matriarchs Desk - Shipping Raids"
 naleni.21.d:0 "Perfumed parchment that bears the smell of distant lands lands upon the desk.\n\nTraders sometimes pay bribes to the Matriarchy in exchange for safe passage through the Naléni pass. This letter comes from one such trader, who despite their bribe had been set on by one of the Odanchesta on their way through the pass, having their cargo and crew plundered. They are demanding restitution for the lost profits."
 naleni.21.a:0 "Compensate the trader and punish the Odanchés."
 naleni.21.b:0 "Let it slide. We are pirates after all."
 naleni.22.t:0 "The Matriarchs Desk - Bribery"
 naleni.22.d:0 "A large pouch of gold sits in the centre of the desk, a small note attached with a pin.\n\nWhilst Naléni does not have codified laws, there are many informal codes that the Odanchésta are expected to adhere to. Sometimes, Odanches attempt to subvert these expectations with a bit of gold in the right place - today the right place is the Matriarch's desk it seems."
 naleni.22.a:0 "We do not take bribes."
 naleni.22.b:0 "Gold goes a long way..."
 naleni.23.t:0 "The Matriarchs Desk - Relationship issues"
 naleni.23.d:0 "No letters rest on the desk, instead a very desperate looking Odanches stands waiting.\n\nThere is not a Odanches alive who would give up the sea, but life on the waves does pose a problem when it comes to the traditional aspects of life - keeping husbands and raising young. This particular Odanches has become so infuriated by the difficulties splitting life between land and sea they have come today to ask for assistance maintaining their roost whilst on ship."
 naleni.23.a:0 "Do nothing, its not our problem."
 naleni.23.b:0 "Assist them, in exchange for support."
 naleni.24.t:0 "The Matriarchs Desk - Strife at Sea"
 naleni.24.d:0 "Two letters lie side by side, both stained - the ink splodgy.\n\nThe unity of the Odanchésta coalition is a fragile thing, and two Odanchésta have recently gotten into a conflict at sea over plunder rights. This is far from an uncommon occurrence, but in this instance both are aggrieved enough to write to the Matriarchy demanding something be done about the other. Divisions like this are ripe for exploitation, though it will require some work."
 naleni.24.a:0 "Exploit their grievance to destabilise the Odanchésta."
 naleni.24.b:0 "Its not worth the effort."
 naleni.25.t:0 "The Matriarchs Desk - A non-Harpy Odanchés?"
 naleni.25.d:0 "An advisor enters the chamber ponderously, bearing most strange news.\n\nThey tell of a Metobesebi human woman who has risen to command her own galley. According to the crew, including the harpies aboard, the human took command and successfully repelled an attacking Raheni galley after the previous Odanches was slain during a boarding action.\n\nThe human woman is now demanding recognition from the other Odanchésta, intending to stand amongst them. Naléni has no written law, but informally only harpies have been permitted to attain positions such as Odanches, a human doing so would be quite an upset, though it is clear this particular human can be very useful."
 naleni.25.a:0 "Assist her bid for recognition, in exchange for support."
 naleni.25.b:0 "Recruit her to the Matriarchys' own navy, she will be of more use there."
 naleni.26.t:0 "The Matriarchs Desk - Popularity Contests"
 naleni.26.d:0 "A thick scroll bearing the mark of the Sirens awaits attention.\n\nAll Siren commanders are obliged to provide a report to the matriarchy concerning the ongoings in their posts, but this report has made its way here due to its description of a rather interesting phenomenon. The popularity of the Sirens with both the Mengi humans and some of our own has been observed already, but amongst some it has risen to almost fanatical levels. So-called ‘fan-groups’ have been forming, and the names of Particular Sirens of note are circulating throughout our realm.\n\nWhilst novel on its own, the truly fascinating facet of this phenomenon is the behaviour elicited from the Odanchésta. Used to being notorious, many Odanchésta seem to have taken their declining import in our cultural consciousness poorly, and as such have begun to perform ever more reckless and daring actions in competition with the Sirens."

 naleni.27.t:0 "The Queens Court - Fame and Fortune"
 naleni.27.d:0 "A monthly report from an advisor drones on and on, until they happen to mention something interesting.\n\nCulture continues to bloom in our nation, and large amounts of our people, harpies and humans alike, have grown to idolise our most impressive figures - Sirens, Odanchésta, even the royalty. Many, especially amongst the young, dream of becoming ‘famous’ themselves, and the fortune they may amass. These groups loom large in the cultural consciousness, and the advisor suggests that perhaps by promoting one of them, we may gain some sway with the people."
 naleni.27.a:0 "Promote the Sirens."

 naleni.28.d:0 "A human woman, wearing a thick leather button jacket over a half corset stands proudly before the throne.\n\nShe stands tall and straight, hair wild, and requests the Queens blessing to serve as a Odanchés in her navy. She lists her time spend aboard other ships, serving with some well renowned Odanchésta, earning the respect of her harpy fellows. She requests a commission, given that she cannot earn one in the usual way, owing to not being a harpy.

The Odanchés merely shrugs, and offers the quite considerable plunder to the Queen in exchange for a pardon."

Initially it functioned as an oversight measure, but for the loyayer Odanchésta it has simply become a matter of utility. However some Odanchésta take grievance with having non subordinates aboard their ships, and often end up butting heads with the Siren commanders as a result. Likewise, the Sirens can sometimes see themselves as overseers to the Odanchés, exacerbating the problem. In this instance a disagreement has brewed so deep its fallen to the attention of the Queen."

Seemingly the shows are ever more increasingly popular, and access has become such an issue that humans will literally fight over spaces in line. Harpies of course simply fly in. This is particularly true of the religious services, due to the fervour of some of the faithful."

Before Ríva’s reforms the Odanchésta would keep the vast majority of their loot, and only tithe a small amount to the Matriarchy. Now they are expected to hand over the largest portion, but seemingly not all are content to do so."

 naleni.35.t:0 "The death of Ríva"
 naleni.35.d:0 "Mourning wails fill the streets of Jezarpizu, so loud they rise even to the mountain roosts above.\n\nWoe they cry. The Queen is dead.\n\nMemorial pyres light the dark skies and line the path as a team of Sirens carries Ríva’s body, reverently wrapped in a silken shroud, down from the palace towards the docks. Along the path of the procession the people gather, human and harpy alike, united in mourning. Many weep, others stay stoic and stony faced, whilst those who hated the queen look on - many an Odanchés amongst them. However no matter the disposition none can deny her achievements, her will, and for that they gather now.\n\nThe Sirens place her body aboard a small boat at the dock, one laden with casks of oil. A single one amongst them takes a torch and boards with the Queen, rowing her out into the waters. At the harbour's heart, they take flight, rising above the boat and letting the lit torch fall.\n\nThe crowds watch, still and silent, as the torch tumbles - a single light in the dark. It lands, the oil erupts, the boat going up in a blaze. And as the flames lick the sky the Sirens begin to sing."
