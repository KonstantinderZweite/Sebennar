 flavor_smallcountry.1.t:0 "Halflings Revolt!"
 flavor_smallcountry.1.d:0 "Our provinces in the Small Country have long felt that they are being ruled by an oppressive and foreign ruler. This discontent has now finally spilled over into open revolt. The halflings have renounced their oath to [Root.GetName] in order to fight for an independent Small Country. If not put down quickly, more provinces might follow them."

 flavor_smallcountry.3.t:0 "Halflings Declare Independence!"
 flavor_smallcountry.3.d:0 "No doubt inspired by former Greentide adventurers, our halfling provinces in the Small Country region have renounced their fealty to [Root.GetName] and declared Independence! They fight for a new and independent Small Country free from the alleged injustices of our rule!"
 flavor_smallcountry.3.a:0 "How dare they?!"
 flavor_smallcountry.4.t:0 "Halfling Freedom Army"
 flavor_smallcountry.4.d:0 "National fervor is sweeping across the lands of the newly independent Small Country! Halfling freedom fighters from all over have gathered in our capital to repel those who try to infringe on our newly won freedom!"
 flavor_smallcountry.5.t:0 "Halfling Claims"
 flavor_smallcountry.5.d:0 "The newly formed Small Country is looking to incorporate all provinces in the Small Country region, and has claimed provinces belonging to us."
 flavor_smallcountry.5.a:0 "Those insolent... small... fools!"
 flavor_smallcountry.6.t:0 "[Root.GetName] Joins the Free Small Country!"
 flavor_smallcountry.6.d:0 "Rather than to succumb to oppressors from outside the Small Country region, [Root.GetName] has decided to join the newly independent Small Country."
 flavor_smallcountry.6.a:0 "The more the merrier!"
 flavor_smallcountry.7.t:0 "[From.GetName] Joins the Small Country"
 flavor_smallcountry.7.d:0 "Rather than to face the risk of extinction, [From.GetName] has requested to join our new nation."
 flavor_smallcountry.7.a:0 "Together to newfound heights!"
 flavor_smallcountry.8.t:0 "[Root.GetName] Revolts!"
 flavor_smallcountry.8.d:0 "Tired of being ruled by someone who is considered an outsider, the people of [Root.GetName] want to seek their liberation by joining the independent Small Country instead."
 flavor_smallcountry.8.a:0 "[Root.GetName] is ours!"
 flavor_smallcountry.8.b:0 "Good riddance!"
 flavor_smallcountry.9.t:0 "Halflings Defy [From.GetAdjective] Oppressors!"
 flavor_smallcountry.9.d:0 "The halfling people of the Small Country region have had enough of the rule of our hated enemies in [From.GetName] and have broken free! Should we ally with this fledgling state to support their independence war?"
 flavor_smallcountry.9.a:0 "We must show them our support!"
 flavor_smallcountry.9.b:0 "This is not our war."
 flavor_smallcountry.10.t:0 "Our Halfling Brethren Declare Independence!"
 flavor_smallcountry.10.d:0 "The long-oppressed halfling peoples of the Small Country, our ancestral homeland, have revolted against their masters! We have enjoyed the liberties of freedom due to our place within the Empire of Anbennar and they look to us for guidance and assistance."
 flavor_smallcountry.10.a:0 "Let us break our own imperial chains and join the Small Country!"
 flavor_smallcountry.10.b:0 "An alliance will allow us to aid them from within the Empire of Anbennar"
 flavor_smallcountry.10.c:0 "So? We're about business, not freedom."
 flavor_smallcountry.11.t:0 "Proliferation of Halfling Tobacco"
 flavor_smallcountry.11.d:0 "For a long time the halflings of Tipney have planted their so called "halfling leaf", a favourite among inhabitants of the Small Country. Recently however, tobacco imported from Aelantir has become popular all across Cannor, and many are clamouring for something a bit more home-grown. This increase in demand has lead other halflings to start their own plantations."
 flavor_smallcountry.11.a:0 "The Halfling's leaf is quite nice indeed."
 flavor_smallcountry.12.t:0 "End of the Halfling Revolt"
 flavor_smallcountry.12.d:0 "We have successfully suppressed the Halfling insurrection, putting an end to all but the most irrelevant pockets of separatist sentiment. The increased [Root.GetAdjective] military presence in the region has done much to frighten into silence even those who simply sought greater autonomy."
 flavor_smallcountry.12.d1:0 "The Halfling Revolt has escalated far beyond what we had anticipated. The rebels have formed a cohesive state and have begun to seek support from our rivals abroad. We must muster our forces and prepare for war!"
 flavor_smallcountry.12.a:0 "This is far worse than a local rebellion."
 flavor_smallcountry.12.b:0 "The insurrection has ended."
 flavor_smallcountry.13.t:0 "An Artist"

 flavor_smallcountry.14.a:0 "Offer them 400 crowns"
 flavor_smallcountry.14.b:0 "It would be too expensive"
 flavor_smallcountry.15.t:0 "Offer from the Small Country"
 flavor_smallcountry.15.d:0 "If you're the player reading this you should just click no. Clicking yes will get your country annexed by the Small Country. They reached a part in their mission tree where they offer to buy Thílvis."
 flavor_smallcountry.15.a:0 "Yes I want to be fully annexed, ending my game"

 flavor_smallcountry.16.t:0 "Thílvis accepts"

 flavor_smallcountry.16.a:0 "Excellent"
 flavor_smallcountry.17.t:0 "Capital of Viswall"
 flavor_smallcountry.17.d:0 "With Viswall rebuilt and recovered, it seems the obvious place for capital of the Small Country. But even though it is united, there still must be a choice of which side of the river the capital building will be."

 flavor_smallcountry.17.b:0 "The South side of Viswall"
 flavor_smallcountry.17.c:0 "Keep our capital where it is"

 #Missions
 A97_unite_redfoot_title:0 "Liberate the Redfoot"
 A97_unite_redfoot_desc:0 "Redfoot is the term for the halflings from the southern half of the Small Country that has for a long time been occupied by Lorent. Red references the rose colors of Lorent. They must be liberated!"
 A97_unite_small_country_title:0 "Unite the Small Country"
 A97_unite_small_country_desc:0 "For too long the human kingdoms have fought over our land and oppressed us! The Small Country must be united!"
 A97_conquer_iochand_title:0 "Conquer Iochand"
 A97_conquer_iochand_desc:0 "Iochand was a gnomish duchy in the past. Since recent times though it's been an area split between Reveria and the gnomish city state Portnamm. This land includes the halfling city of Turnwell, which would already be a part of the Small Country if not for outsider meddling. The Portroy river which mostly flows through the Small Country enters the western ocean through the city of Portnamm. So any expansion aimed towards the western ocean should start with Iochand."
 A97_conquer_reaver_coast_title:0 "Expel the Reavers"
 A97_conquer_reaver_coast_desc:0 "In the time before, reavers from Gerudia established the kingdom of Reveria. Pushing out the gnome and halfling inhabitants. Finally it's time to retake this land."
 A97_conquer_dragonhills_title:0 "Tame the Dragon"
 A97_conquer_dragonhills_desc:0 "We must strike the first blow against Gawed, and weaken their strength for the coming wars. Claiming the foothills of the Dragon Coast seems like a good start, and will force the gnomes to give us grudging respect."
 A97_floodmarches_fort_title:0 "Fortified Floodmarches"
 A97_floodmarches_fort_desc:0 "The Floodmarches are the perfect defensive location to protect the Small Country from the North. A narrow strip of land, marshy, local salt supplies for preserving supplies, and a coast to import supplies from. This will be the Northern border of the Small Country."
 A97_unite_bluefoot_title:0 "Liberate the Bluefoot"
 A97_unite_bluefoot_desc:0 "Bluefoot is the term for the halflings from the northern half of the Small Country which for many years was controlled by Gawed. The blue refers to Gawed being blue."
 A97_trade_fleet_title:0 "Trade Fleet"
 A97_trade_fleet_desc:0 "The Small Country region is typically considered landlocked, but as our country reaches a coast we get proper access to sea-based trade. We have to protect this trade."
 A97_westport_title:0 "Control Westport"
 A97_westport_desc:0 "Most halfling merchants leaving the Small Country choose between the Damescrown or Westport. Westport is historically associated with Lorent, but now that we're free we'll use Westport to our advantage."
 A97_colonial_dalaire_title:0 "Colonize Dalaire"
 A97_colonial_dalaire_desc:0 "Dalaire is not the perfect farmland halflings of the Small Country want, but it's an issue of distance. Ships can easily reach Dalaire, and there are many halflings that would even be willing to live in Dalaire for the chance of their own farmland. It's not all bad, the South is warm enough."
 A97_colonial_noruin_title:0 "Colonize Noruin"
 A97_colonial_noruin_desc:0 "All halflings wish to own their own farm, but with population growing not all of them can find it in the Small Country. Noruin is the perfect destination for any halfling feeling too crowded. Wide open plains, temperate climate, and even new interesting plants to farm."
 A97_conquer_southroy_title:0 "Expand to the Middanroy"
 A97_conquer_southroy_desc:0 "The Middanroy river runs most of its path through the Small Country. In the southwest it'd be a fitting place to define our border. A fort on the river will defend the Small Country from any southern invasion."
 A97_river_fort_title:0 "Fortify the Middanroy Border"
 A97_river_fort_desc:0 "With our borders expanded, now it's time to define and defend them. The Middanroy shall be where we stop anybody hoping to invade the Small Country from the South."
 A97_defeat_oppressors_title:0 "Punish the Oppressors"
 A97_defeat_oppressors_desc:0 "Gawed and Lorent split us in two pieces. For too long the halflings were divided because of them. We must punish these brutal hegemons and prove our own glory!"
 A97_trade_company_region_abroad_title:0 "A Fleet of Small Traders"
 A97_trade_company_region_abroad_desc:0 "Our ships now trade up and down the Dame and beyond, but stories of Halfmen in the far south spur our traders onwards. It is time to expand their reach with strategic trading posts in Sarhal."
 A97_sarhal_placeholder_title:0 "Sarhal Placeholder"
 A97_sarhal_placeholder_desc:0 "Sarhal Placeholder"
 A97_home_trade_title:0 "Home Trade"
 A97_home_trade_desc:0 "For too long the halflings of the Small Country have been forced to bring their goods to foreign markets for the benefit of others. Now halfling trade is done by halflings for their own benefit. We must keep it safe under the Small Country."
 A97_dragon_coast_title:0 "Northern Trade"
 A97_dragon_coast_desc:0 "When looking abroad for trade partners, our only unique advantage is to go North to the Dragon Coast. The only way goods get from Gerudia to the Damescrown is South along the coast, and often through the Small Country."
 A97_damescrown_title:0 "Control Damescrown"

 A97_import_corn_title:0 "Import Corn"
 A97_import_corn_desc:0 "Settlers in North Aelantir have found a new type of grain they think would grow well in the Small Country. Corn grows in the same places wheat can grow, but at a different time of year. Making a good complement to wheat. Bigwheat is known for... wheat farming. Now they can have Bigcorn too."
 A97_colonial_banished_isles_title:0 "Establish Colonial Offices"
 A97_colonial_banished_isles_desc:0 "With our colonial efforts growing it makes sense to create a dedicated government office for their management. Based out of Portnamm, the colonial offices will be dedicated to ensuring effective governing of colonial efforts in Aelantir, meaning they stay loyal and ensure that goods produced there go to the Small Country first."
 A97_rebuild_viswall_title:0 "Rebuild Viswall"
 A97_rebuild_viswall_desc:0 "Viswall was a great halfling city, sadly split in two after the Viswall rebellion led to Gawed and Lorent cooperating to put the halflings down. In the wars since, including those to unite the Small Country, Viswall has received further damage. Our first priority as a unified Small Country should be repairing this grand city."
 A97_reinvigorate_greymill_title:0 "Reinvigorate Greymill"
 A97_reinvigorate_greymill_desc:0 "The town of Greymill was an important city for the bluefoot halflings.

During the Wars of Dominion Lorentish armies burned many of the mills down. "
 A97_viswall_brandy_title:0 "Viswall Brandy"
 A97_viswall_brandy_desc:0 "Long have the Redfoot Halflings of Appleton made their apples into cider and the Bluefoot Halflings of Pearview made their pears into perry. As a symbol of halfling unification, we have also united their alcohols: combining cider with perry, and distilling the result, has given us an excellent new liquor we have appropriately named after the city of Viswall: Viswall Brandy! While its popularity among halflings owes something to symbolism, its high alcohol content ensures its popularity even further."
 A97_hardoaks_hardwood_title:0 "Hardoaks Hardwood"
 A97_hardoaks_hardwood_desc:0 "The region of Elkmarch (called Lorentish Approach by the Gawedi) is the largest forest in the Small Country. It's the only part where hunting is a common job for halflings. Within Elkmarch, the town of Hardoaks produces very fine lumber, some of it drawn from the rest of the forest. High quality wood allows local building projects to be completed easier, and is great for shipbuilding."
 A97_coppertown_industry_title:0 "Coppertown Industry"
 A97_coppertown_industry_desc:0 "The Coppertown area is known as the most industrial part of the Small Country. Large scale cloth production is done in the city of Barrowshire, while copper mines fill the hills nearby. We should invest in this region to establish an industrial zone for weapons production and more."
 A97_halfling_weed_title:0 "Cultivate Tipney Leaf"
 A97_halfling_weed_desc:0 "Tipney Leaf is a traditional halfling crop grown to be smoked for a relaxing effect. Production has been most prominent in Tipney, and stayed a product consumed mainly by halflings. Once tobacco was discovered in Aelantir though, the rest of Cannor got interested in it. New halfling leaf plantations started around the Small Country shortly after."
 A97_prosperity_title:0 "Prosperity"
 A97_prosperity_desc:0 "The prosperity of the Small Country is what's truly important. Our ultimate goal should be a good life for all halflings."

 A97_conquer_beepeck_title:0 "Integrate Beepeck"
 A97_conquer_beepeck_desc:0 "Beepeck sticks out from the rest of the Small Country as a halfling city that has retained pseudo-independence and safety within the Empire of Anbennar. It is for this reason that they decided to stay out of our newly unified Small Country. But we must bring them in if we are to truly unite the halflings."
 A97_conquer_uelaire_title:0 "Conquer Uelaire"
 A97_conquer_uelaire_desc:0 "Before the war of the Sorcerer-King, the lands now known as Uelaire were part of the Small Country. Halflings suffered during the war, but the League of Free Realms saved the Small Country. However, after saving the Small Country, a large group of soldiers decided to take some land for themselves. That land would become Uelaire. It's finally time to retake the part of the Small Country that's been missing for so long."
 A97_conquer_exwes_title:0 "Extend our Reach South"
 A97_conquer_exwes_desc:0 "With our people mostly united, we need to make sure we have the defenses to maintain it, and coin to pay for it. While extending our domain into Exwes may upset the Emperor, the minority of halflings in their land give us ample justification to integrate their lands, and fortify it from the approach of Lorentish and Damerian armies from the south as well as reap the benefits from its well developed ports."
 A97_beepeck_port_title:0 "The Greatest Little Market"
 A97_beepeck_port_desc:0 "We must build a trade empire that caters to our people, and no longer put the tall as the gold standard of trade or commerce. The port and markets of Beepeck will be built up into a massive sprawling sea of tents and stalls and warehouses, where anything a Halfling could want can be bought and bargained for."
 
 #Tooltips
 A97_buy_thilvis_tooltip:0 "We will send an offer to buy the Aelantiri halfling nation of Thílvis. If Thílvis is gone, we can claim all the Visfoot Halfling provinces in Aelantir they left behind."
