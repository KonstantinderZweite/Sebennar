  sanghariyar_raghamidesh_unification_desc:0 "For too long have our people been divided, a division that has only led to suffering and hardship for all the Raghamidesh. The time is long overdue for the cities and people to be unified under one banner, and we will be the ones to do it."
  
  avhavubhiya_school_of_diplomats_title:0 "School of "Diplomats""
  avhavubhiya_school_of_diplomats_desc:0 "We may not historically be the most wealthy or powerful Raghamidesh state, but we are the most crafty. We should invest in training more of our “diplomats” to further expand our influence"
 
  avhavubhiya_mercenary_reliance_title:0 "Mercenary Reliance"
  avhavubhiya_mercenary_reliance_desc:0 "Other states are moving towards expensive standing armies for their protection. We, however, have deep ties with the mercenary world that we use to field a great army, for a fraction of the cost."
 
  avhavubhiya_a_puppeteer_title:0 "A Puppeteer..."
  avhavubhiya_a_puppeteer_desc:0 "Our agents have worked tirelessly, and our master plan is almost ready. Only a few pieces remain, most notably targets to realign to our interests…"

  avhavubhiya_needs_puppets_desc:0 "The time has come, our men are ready. Tonight we move in the shadows, and bring those who trusted our agents closer to our state than they ever could have imagined."
 
  avhavubhiya_expanding_the_corps_title:0 "Expanding the Corps"
  avhavubhiya_expanding_the_corps_desc:0 "Our agents have proven very effective at manipulating and silently subverting our enemies. We should invest in expanding this branch of our diplomats, for protection of course.."

  avhavubhiya_rival_sarkhashabidi_traders_desc:0 "Sarkashabid have long controlled the flow of trade on this side of the gulf with their deep trade connections. We must demonstrate to the merchants that our ports are a more lucrative destination!"
 
  avhavubhiya_irrigate_the_drylands_title:0 "Irrigate the Drylands"
  avhavubhiya_irrigate_the_drylands_desc:0 "Our great city rests upon the fringes of a great expanse of dryland, stretching to the Marutha desert. If Avhavubhiya is to flourish, we must bring water and life to these harsh lands that surround her."
 
  avhavubhiya_sabotage_the_powers_title:0 "Sabotage the Powers"
  avhavubhiya_sabotage_the_powers_desc:0 "Across Haless the incumbent powers look down upon us, believing they are untouchable. Let us dispatch our agents to remind them of just how easily their facade can be broken."
 
  avhavubhiya_improve_capital_infrastructure_title:0 "Improve Capital Infrastructure"
  avhavubhiya_improve_capital_infrastructure_desc:0 "Our city is great, but it is not yet the greatest in all of Haless. We should increase our investment in the city, so that it may shine like the true gem it is!"
 
  avhavubhiya_a_coastal_highway_title:0 "A Coastal Highway"
  avhavubhiya_a_coastal_highway_desc:0 "The golden highway was a stroke of genius by Jaher, allowing vast wealth and armies to move quickly across the world. We should create our own coastal highway, to better connect the cities, and their wealth, to our capital."
 
  sarkhashabid_questions_of_faith_title:0 "Questions of Faith"
  sarkhashabid_questions_of_faith_desc:0 "Could it be that the High Gods teaching are false? Surely not, though what if there is truth in what Suhan speaks? We must strive to find answers in these trying times, and decide what we believe…"

  sarkhashabid_invite_the_treasure_fleet_title:0 "Invite the Treasure Fleet"
  sarkhashabid_invite_the_treasure_fleet_desc:0 "For many years we have heard tales of the legendary Treasure Fleet, from the lands far to the North. Now after the destruction of piracy in the Raheni gulf and the great reach of our influence, we may be able to invite them to sail to our cities. All we need now is a tempting first offer."
 
  sarkhashabid_elevation_of_the_merchants_title:0 "Elevation of the Merchants"
  sarkhashabid_elevation_of_the_merchants_desc:0 "For a long time our merchants have enjoyed privileges that would never ordinarily have been granted to a middle caste anywhere in Rahen. Today, we formalise the ascent of the merchant caste, from the middle castes to the upper caste, where they belong."
 
  sarkhashabid_merchant_marine_title:0 "The Merchant Marine"
  sarkhashabid_merchant_marine_desc:0 "With the recent rise in overseas operations and our growing ambition, our current trade fleet is under increasing strain. We must focus on increasing the size of our Merchant marine if we are to keep up with our ever growing maritime empire."
 
  sarkhashabid_trade_investments_title:0 "Trade Investments"
  sarkhashabid_trade_investments_desc:0 "Our current trade fleet will simply not suffice for our ambitious goals. We must invest into our fleet if we are to succeed."
 
  sarkhashabid_diplomat_training_title:0 "Diplomat Training"
  sarkhashabid_diplomat_training_desc:0 "Diplomacy has always been one of our strongest weapons in securing and maintaining our position. Let us expand our diplomatic corp to aid in our continued expansion."
 
  sarkhashabid_school_of_diplomats_title:0 "School of Diplomats"
  sarkhashabid_school_of_diplomats_desc:0 "Our diplomatic corp is proving its worth as our empire continues to expand, but as of late we have found new candidates increasingly difficult to find. We should establish a school to ensure we have a continued supply of able diplomats."
 
  sarkhashabid_the_great_port_title:0 "The Great Port"
  sarkhashabid_the_great_port_desc:0 "Sarkhashabid is a shining jewel on the Raheni coast, and a busy entrepot for trade in the Rahen gulf, yet the port facilities are in need of an overhaul. We will renovate the ageing infrastructure to maximise the great port’s potential as the primary destination for traders in South Rahen."
 
  sarkhashabid_emulation_of_the_high_ones_title:0 "As the Ones Most High"
  sarkhashabid_emulation_of_the_high_ones_desc:0 "Our empire stretches across continents, and our quest for Purtana through wealth has thoroughly been achieved as wealth courses unhindered across all corners of our empire. Let us now prove our dedication to the High Gods and erect a temple to outshine all others!"
 
  davharral_modernising_the_fleet_title:0 "Modernising the Fleet"
  davharral_modernising_the_fleet_desc:0 "With our inheritance of Dakmender opening the path for continued expansion in Madrilamak, our fleet of galleys and old transports is in need of modernisation. We should rebuild our current fleet in the style of newer, bigger warships to better protect the sea links between our home and Sarhal."
 
  davharral_city_of_innovation_title:0 "City of Innovation"
  davharral_city_of_innovation_desc:0 "Our city stands upon the great caravansary, and as such a vast array of people flow through our nation on a daily basis. These people could hold the secrets we need to solve our water crisis forever. Let us build the greatest university in the gulf coast to attract these minds to our cause."
 
  davharral_an_elevated_workforce_title:0 "An Elevated Workforce"
  davharral_an_elevated_workforce_desc:0 "The harpies have long been a point of contention for our people, with their frequent raids and kidnappings. However, should they become integrated into our society, their ability to fly would boost our construction capabilities significantly."
 
  davharral_restore_the_flow_title:0 "Restore the Flow"
  davharral_restore_the_flow_desc:0 "There was once an aqueduct that flowed down from the mountains to give our city water in an otherwise barren place. We must restore this aqueduct soon if we wish to continue fostering growth in our great city!"
 
  davharral_extending_the_aqueduct_title:0 "Extending the Aqueduct"
  davharral_extending_the_aqueduct_desc:0 "With the aqueduct restored, Davharral grows freely once more. Now a handful of engineers have approached us with an opportunity to extend the aqueduct to other provinces. Such an endeavour would be expensive, but the growth it would provide makes it worth the cost"
 
  davharral_conquering_the_coast_title:0 "Conquering the Coast"
  davharral_conquering_the_coast_desc:0 "With our position in the gulf secured, it is time we turn our attention to the West. Our great city is dangerously close to the border and should our neighbour decide to invade, it would be an easy target. For the greater good and security of our people, we must seize the coast for ourselves."
 
  davharral_restoration_of_dasmastus_title:0 "Restoration of Dasmatus"
  davharral_restoration_of_dasmastus_desc:0 "Dasmatus was once a great nation on the coast of the Salahad, now laid to ruin by the gnolls. With the coast secured, we are presented with a prime opportunity to drive back the gnolls and restore the Kingdom to it’s former glory, under our careful guidance of course…"
 
  davharral_digging_wells_title:0 "Digging Wells"
  davharral_digging_wells_desc:0 "Our great aqueduct has fallen into disrepair and we lack the resources to repair it. We may have gained a foothold across the gulf but our capital is suffering a catastrophic drought. There are reports of small underground aquifers beneath the city from the royal surveyors. We must build wells to access these reserves urgently. They will not stop the problem forever, but they will buy us time"
 
  davharral_reward_veterans_title:0 "Reward Veterans"
  davharral_reward_veterans_desc:0 "With the city of Dakmender rightfully seized from our debtors, we should look to reward our most senior and long serving soldiers. Such an example of frugality will help boost morale and recruitment, but surely please the High Gods above!"
 
  davharral_improve_capital_infrastructure_title:0 "Improve Capital Infrastructure"
  davharral_improve_capital_infrastructure_desc:0 "Our capital is under-developed for the current expansion plans of our nation. We must invest and foster the needed institutions to ensure our growing empire has a capable heart."
 
  iyarhashar_a_pound_of_flesh_title:0 "A Pound of Flesh"
  iyarhashar_a_pound_of_flesh_desc:0 "We have gained a foothold in Madrimalik but our position is tentative at best. The slavers guild helped us take these lands, and now they expect their dues, though the locals will not appreciate being enslaved."
 
  iyarhashar_maintain_the_status_quo_title:0 "Maintain the Status Quo"
  iyarhashar_maintain_the_status_quo_desc:0 "Our position in the region has been secured, thanks in not small part to the slavers guild’s efforts. We should maintain their position and power in our agendas, though some are warning this will lead to problems later, and they are in the minority. What could go wrong?"
 
  iyarhashar_mengi_relations_title:0 "Mengi Relations"
  iyarhashar_mengi_relations_desc:0 "Our relations with the Mengi people have been poor as of late due to our activities in the Telekenid region. We should work to improve our rapport with some of the states here and see if we can reach a more….amicable arrangement."
 
  iyarhashar_a_gift_to_new_friends_title:0 "A Gift to New Friends..."
  iyarhashar_a_gift_to_new_friends_desc:0 "We have made strong connections with several Mengi states thanks to our diplomatic activities. Now that we have earned their trust we should arrange some gifts for new friends!"
 
  iyarhashar_repaid_with_interest_title:0 "...Repaid with Interest"
  iyarhashar_repaid_with_interest_desc:0 "But of course, gifts are never truly free, and today our “friends” will repay their debt with fealty and servitude. We are their rightful sovereigns, and they will bow before us as friends, or be crushed into submission."
 
  iyarhashar_defensive_preparations_title:0 "Defensive Preparations"
  iyarhashar_defensive_preparations_desc:0 "Our situation is tenuous. Our enemies surround us, our new colonial holdings are unruly, and a rising dragon in Sramaya threatens our mercantile way of life. We must make preparations for what is to come, for war looms heavy on the horizon..."
 
  iyarhashar_bavijay_shipyard_title:0 "Bavijay Shipyards"
  iyarhashar_bavijay_shipyard_desc:0 "The province of Bavijay has long been a producer of some of the finest ships in our navy, but its current facilities are outdated and far too small to meet our growing needs. It is time for us to build new shipyards so that our ship building capacity keeps up with our ever growing navy."
 
  iyarhashar_training_marines_title:0 "Training Marines"
  iyarhashar_training_marines_desc:0 "While many traditional empires would see minimal use for their marine corp, we are different. Their ability to effectively fight at sea and skill in coastal landings makes them invaluable for our ambitious maritime empire. We must seek to grow and expand this corp so our expansion continues unhindered, and give us an edge over our targets."
 
  iyarhashar_a_monumental_fortress_title:0 "A Monumental Fortress"
  iyarhashar_a_monumental_fortress_desc:0 "Sardika has long stood as a bastion of our great nation, nestled against the sea, its mighty walls have repelled countless would-be invaders. Now, however, the rhythms of war are changing, and our mighty fortress must be improved if it is to remain the bulwark of our people. Let us renovate the fortress, so she may stand for many more generations as a monument to our might."
 
  shenral_a_major_heresy_title:0 "A Major Heresy"
  shenral_a_major_heresy_desc:0 "High Philosophy was born from Harimar the Greats conquests and visions for Haless, and it has stood dominant throughout Rahen for over a thousand years since. The faith is not without flaws, flaws that this “Suhan” is using to justify their own heretical beliefs. Several of these beliefs are logical, however, and our people are divided. We must take a side in this great philosophical debate and unite the followers of the High Gods once more, in the name of Purtana!"
 
  shenral_faith_united_once_more_title:0 "Faith United Once More"
  shenral_faith_united_once_more_desc:0 "The debate is over, the crisis resolved. In the name of the High Gods, the faith of Rahen has been united once more."
 
  shenral_repair_the_highway_title:0 "Repair the Highway"
  shenral_repair_the_highway_desc:0 "The once great Golden Highway travels through our lands, lying in ruins, a mere shadow of its former glory. With our expansion and conquests we have come to control a significant proportion of the highway, and our advisors believe restoring it would be in our best interests. It would be a monumental undertaking, but the benefits would far exceed the cost. Let us secure the needed resources and set up a commission to oversee it’s restoration."
 
  shenral_encourage_dwarven_settlements_title:0 "Encourage Dwarven Settlement"
  shenral_encourage_dwarven_settlements_desc:0 "A large population of Peridot dwarves have long resided within the walls of Shenral, working the forges and working in the many iron mines near the city. We should encourage more dwarven settlements throughout the foothills near Shenral, where their expertise may help us find new veins."
 
  shenral_increase_production_title:0 "Increase Production"
  shenral_increase_production_desc:0 "Our recent conquests have borne fruits, with the mining province of Kastiyar coming into our possession. At the same time, recent efforts to increase settlements of dwarves throughout our lands have proven quite successful and a number of powerful clan leaders have now approached our [Get.Monarch.Title] with an offer. In exchange for some degree of autonomy, they would aid us in administering the province, and promise that the mines will flow like never before."
 
  shenral_bolster_the_bloody_gate_title:0 "Bolster the Bloody Gate"
  shenral_bolster_the_bloody_gate_desc:0 "The Bloody Gate is infamous throughout southern Rahen for its red-stained history. Many times invaders both within Rahen and without have been halted here, their blood staining the soils and rivers. It was here the armies of Ramapalar II won their “decisive” victory over the Southern Alliance, gaining our servitude but vastly weakening their forces. With our growing ambitions, it is high time we bolster the defences of the great fortress."
 
  shenral_prospecting_in_tegaksa_title:0 "Prospecting in Tegaksa"
  shenral_prospecting_in_tegaksa_desc:0 "The foothills of Tegaksa have long been a part of our nation, but despite our many efforts we have never been able to find any mineral wealth within them. Our new dwarven settlers within the province, however, believe they may be able to fare better in this search with their knowledge. With some funding from the royal coffers they will scour the hills and are confident they can tap whatever lays within."
 
  shenral_shenrali_steelworks_title:0 "Shenrali Steelworks"
  shenral_shenrali_steelworks_desc:0 "Shenrali steel has been renowned throughout Rahen as some of the highest quality steel for some time, but it has never been able to be produced en masse to provide for anything but the most wealthy and powerful. It is time to change that. We will build a great forge with the help of the dwarves reminiscent of the mighty forge halls of the holds within the Dwarovar. With it we will create scimitars sharp enough to tear through armour and more cannons than ever before."
 
  sanghariyar_open_debates_title:0 "Open Debates"
  sanghariyar_open_debates_desc:0 "The bureaucratic crisis in our government continues to rage on, hindering our parliament's ability to effectively act. Some of our closest advisors have suggested that perhaps we should open debates about how to resolve our crisis to the broader philosophical community. This would naturally cause outrage in the parliament and some instability, but it may be needed if we are to make any progress."
 
  sanghariyar_extend_representation_title:0 "Extend Representation"
  sanghariyar_extend_representation_desc:0 "The consensus is clear, we must open representation up to all peoples of our nation, not just the Raheni elites. This would be two fold in nature. The first would be granting parliamentary representation to the other species of our nation in provinces of their majority populations, and opening up rulership candidacy to some of the Mengi houses. The path to progress is unity of all our peoples, not just ourselves!"
 
  sanghariyar_palace_for_a_god_title:0 "Palace Fit for a God"
  sanghariyar_palace_for_a_god_desc:0 "Our faith in the High Gods has never wavered, despite the tumultuous schism of late within High Philosophy. In light of these events, we should prove our devotion and construct a palace so grand and magnificent the High Gods themselves would wish to call it home!"
 
  sanghariyar_raheni_colonies_title:0 "Secure Raheni Colonies"
  sanghariyar_raheni_colonies_desc:0 "While our Raheni holdings have been consolidated and centralised, the colonies in Sarhal still retain much autonomy from the crown, or are owned by other realms entirely. We must bring these lands under our direct control and consolidate our colonies there too, for the greater good of our people.While our heartlands have been unified directly under the crown’s authority, the various Raheni colonies of Sarhal remain divided among various states. We shall unite these colonies under our banner, so they may be better administered, and for our own gain of course."
 
  sanghariyar_financial_dominance_title:0 "Financial Dominance"
  sanghariyar_financial_dominance_desc:0 "Boyebareti is a relentless thorn in our side. They rebuked Sarkhashibids invasion attempt several decades ago and now stand in the way of a contiguous land connection between our colonies. Invading so soon would draw attention, so let us do what we do best, make money, and with that money, dominate this irritable state into submission."
 
  sanghariyar_crush_boyebareti_title:0 "Crush Boyebareti"
  sanghariyar_crush_boyebareti_desc:0 "Despite our clear economic supremacy and financial pressure Boyebareti refuses to bow before us. We have no choice, this thorn must be excised and the colonies connected. Rally the soldiers, for we march to war."
 
  sanghariyar_in_control_title:0 "In Control"
  sanghariyar_in_control_desc:0 "With the foothills of the Gleti Sedara secured, our position along the northern coast of Meklamengi is solidified. We are in control, now we will shore up our defences and bolster our troops, for this, this is only the beginning."
 
  sanghariyar_spread_the_teachings_title:0 "Spread the Teachings"
  sanghariyar_spread_the_teachings_desc:0 "Sky Domain is the common faith of many of the Mengi people and states. While similar in some ways to our own faith, they are not the same. How can these poor souls ever achieve Purtana if they do not even understand the word? We must spread the teachings of the High Gods to our new lands in Sarhal, for our new citizens' good!"
 
  sanghariyar_sailors_ascent_title:0 "Sailors' Ascent"
  sanghariyar_sailors_ascent_desc:0 "Our maritime empire grows ever larger, and with it sailors and ship captains have become important parts of our nation, so much so that they have lifted themselves out of the lower caste and into the middle caste. Such an event has not happened in a very long time. This truly is the dawn of a new age."
 
  sanghariyar_breaking_the_chains_title:0 "Breaking the Chains"
  sanghariyar_breaking_the_chains_desc:0 "While the practice of slavery has existed within our nation and its holdings for as long as many can remember, not many in power have ever stopped to question if such a thing should be practised. As of late, pressure has been mounting to abolish this barbaric practice and break the chains of slavery, and our [Get.Monarch.Title] agrees. With the recent shifts in the fluidity of the castes, it is time to end slavery. This will cause instability no doubt, but it is the right thing to do in the eyes of the Ones Above."
 
  sanghariyar_southern_section_title:0 "The Southern Section"
  sanghariyar_southern_section_desc:0 "Our holdings in Sarhal have been long established within our de jure domain, but this has done little to deter our neighbours from raiding and skirmishing across our borders. These raids and skirmishes are a headache for local garrisons to combat and are placing unnecessary strain on our resources. Let us construct a great wall that runs across our lands to deter these skirmishers and block raids into our lands."
 
  sanghariyar_cultural_assimilation_title:0 "Cultural Assimilation"
  sanghariyar_cultural_assimilation_desc:0 "A resolution has been reached, though to many it is the worst outcome, those who think different to us must be made to see the fallacy of their ways. We will oust those who are not human or harimari, and aggressively press our culture and beliefs upon those with our borders. This will certainly draw the ire of both our people and other states for these unethical practices, but in the eyes of the ruling class, the ground is shifting beneath our feet, and there is no other way out."
 
  sanghariyar_reform_bureaucracy_title:0 "Reform the Bureaucracy"
  sanghariyar_reform_bureaucracy_desc:0 "Our government and bureaucracy has been reformed, for better or worse, and at last we have reached the end of this dark crisis. The path to the future of Sanghariyar looks bright upon the horizon. With this crisis behind us, we are ready to take the final steps towards total dominion of the seas and the wealth of Haless and Sarhal."
 
  sanghariyar_homeland_united_title:0 "Homeland United"
  sanghariyar_homeland_united_desc:0 "Our control of the Raghamidesh heartlands, our Sarhali holdings and the gulf of Sramaya has been solidified. Our people have ascended to a position of power not held by us in history. The future is bright for Sanghariyar. We will rule the seas and break our foes before our might like rocks before the waves. This is only the beginning."
 
  sanghariyar_dragon_rival_title:0 "Rival the Dragon"
  sanghariyar_dragon_rival_desc:0 "Bhuvauri has long been growing in strength and might, with it’s heart beating in Sramaya, the supposed home of Jyntas themselves. This dragon hoards and grows fat from the wealth of the Kharunyana and the Dhenbasana rivers. They are an existential threat to our way of life, if we are to survive, the dragon must fall."
 
  sanghariyar_dragon_eclipsed_title:0 "Eclipsing the Dragon"
  sanghariyar_dragon_eclipsed_desc:0 "A shadow looms over Sramaya, and the dragon quakes in fear, for they have finally met their match. We have ascended the rungs of power and now stand above the once arrogant Bhuvauri, greater than they could have conceived. Poised and ready to strike, we will seize the heart of their power from them and cast them down. They cow before us now, knowing their end is near. The reign of the dragon is over."
 
  sanghariyar_control_the_estuary_title:0 "Control the Estuary"
  sanghariyar_control_the_estuary_desc:0 "The dragon has fallen. We have snatched its heart from it and now she lies a fragment of their former glory. Now all that remains is to tighten our grasp on the many estuaries around Sramaya. The dragon is dying, we will end its misery, and grow stronger from the remains of it’s would-be empire."
 
  sanghariyar_secure_the_homeland_title:0 "Secure the Homeland"
  sanghariyar_secure_the_homeland_desc:0 "Our position is stabilised, the threats which once loomed over our divided city states have been decimated. The dragon has been caste down, the spoils of her nation and the wealth of those lands fueling our conquest of Telekimid and consolidation of the Rahen Coast. The homelands have been secured, but now it is time for us to look outwards, and forge our kingdom into an empire!"
 
  sanghariyar_dealing_with_pirates_title:0 "Dealing with Pirates"
  sanghariyar_dealing_with_pirates_desc:0 "A number of pirate states have festered and found residence around the gulf of Rahen. These reavers are bad for business, harassing our maritime traders and merchants. We must put a stop to this madness. These pirates must be destroyed and made an example of, so no one else dares strike our merchant marine again."
 
  sanghariyar_southern_frontier_title:0 "Expand the Southern Frontier"
  sanghariyar_southern_frontier_desc:0 "Our colonies in Sarhal have borne fruits, bringing wealth both material and cultural to our nation, but it appears we have but scratched the surface. Our recent conquests have further fueled our Sarhali ambitions, as our grip on the Haless-Sarhal trade routes tightens. There are more lands further to the south, waiting for its potential to be tapped. We must seize the key ports in these lands, so our grip may grow ever tighter."
 
  sanghariyar_dakinshi_trade_title:0 "Dakinshi Trade"
  sanghariyar_dakinshi_trade_desc:0 "The Dakinshi lands have been known to our people since we began trading and operating in the lands of the Mengi people, however, we have never before ventured so far south. Now with these ports secured, we have learned there is one further major trade hub this side of Sarhal. Let us establish a trade state in the Dakinshi lands so they can focus on the exploitation of our conquests, while we begin our final push south. Hoist the flag and rally the troops, our victory is near at hand!"
 
  sanghariyar_tighten_the_noose_title:0 "Tighten the Noose"
  sanghariyar_tighten_the_noose_desc:0 "Biya Mubidya has fallen before our might. We now control a majority of the trade in this area, and with it, our grasp on the trade between Haless and Sarhal is almost absolute. Our hegemony is nigh unquestionable. It is time we tighten the noose, tie up any loose ends, and crush the last of the competition. There is only one market on these seas, and it is ours."
 
  sanghariyar_trade_supremacy_title:0 "Trade Supremacy"
  sanghariyar_trade_supremacy_desc:0 "It is done, our nitikamarja has led us to this place. The competition has been stomped out, our control of the seas is so absolute not even Cinlau dares contest our supremacy. Our mighty flagships command fleets from Bwa Dakinshi to Sramaya to Feiten. All we have done, we did in the name of the High Gods, and with our hegemony secured, we surely have attained purtana for all our peoples. Yet, perhaps there is still more to achieve, there are still more markets to secure, from Aelantir to Bahar; but they will come in time. For now, let us celebrate, for we are triumphant!"
 
  sanghariyar_jungle_training_title:0 "Jungle Training Exercises"
  sanghariyar_jungle_training_desc:0 "Harimar’s cradle borders our great state, under the control of the once mighty Harimraj. Recently, however, it appears the raj has been suffering from success, and now there may soon exist an opportunity for us to snatch the cradle from their grasp. However, the jungles of those lands are fierce and unforgiving, and if we are to capitalise on an opportunity, we must prepare to fight in such hostile lands. We control part of the jungle already, a perfect training and staging ground for our operation."
 
  sanghariyar_stealing_the_cradle_title:0 "Stealing the Cradle"
  sanghariyar_stealing_the_cradle_desc:0 "The time has come, the Raja is losing control. Their grip on their subjects is weak, their empire a shadow of its former might that once marched to claim the Raghamidesh cities all those generations ago. It is time for us to strike. Rally the banners and muster them in our jungle training fields. It is time for us to steal the cradle the Raja holds so dearly, yet so feebly."
 
  sanghariyar_secure_the_jungle_title:0 "Secure the Jungle"
  sanghariyar_secure_the_jungle_desc:0 "Our plan was a success! The cradle is ours, but now we must decide what to do with it. The jungles are a veritable nightmare to navigate, let alone administer. Rabaghekur has controlled these lands for quite some time, and have been effective in their oversight of the cradle as a senapti of the raj. It has been decided that they shall govern these lands for us, their expertise and knowledge of the lands make them a perfect candidate."
 
  sanghariyar_up_the_coast_title:0 "Up the Coast"
  sanghariyar_up_the_coast_desc:0 "Prukakhin and its plague upon Haless has been destroyed, and we have gained control of the Khindi area. While we could rule these lands directly, many have suggested a subject state may prove more effective.

 sanghariyar.0.t:0 "Ending the Divide"
 sanghariyar.0.desc:0 "Ever since the invasion of the Phoenix empire into Rahen in the 12th century, the Raghamidesh have never been united under a single ruler. The five cities have squibbled and squabbled over one another, seeking an edge in the market or the military. A dangerous division that almost cost us all our freedom when Ramapalar the I reunified the Harimraj and marched south. \n\nOnly through deft diplomacy by the Sarkhashibid elites was a coalition formed against the threat, but it was not enough. Shenral fell to the invaders, their armies too strong for the divided armies of the coalition. Shenral and it’s people still remember the day, feelings of betrayal still bubble beneath the surface, begging to be unleashed. \n\nIn spite of this failure, it was a wake up call for the noble houses of the Raghamidesh. Their division would only bring about their ruin in time, unity was the only path to safety. Ever since, efforts have been made to unify the free Raghamidesh states, albeit with limited success. Now as the Jaddari legion grows in power to the West and the dragon of Sramaya looms to the East, our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has had enough. If the other houses will not cooperate willingly, they will be made to cooperate by force. “The tides of change are shifting, and if we do not act now, we will find ourselves split and skewered between the phoenix and the dragon! The time for unification is now, or it may never come!” "
 sanghariyar.0.a:0 "We must act swiftly if we are to survive!"

Currently, [Root.Capital.GetName] stands as the epicentre of our kingdom, but is this really the best location? \n\nHeated debates rage throughout the council chambers for weeks, with various nobles and important figures arguing for this city or that. Eventually, our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] raises their paw for silence, before standing and proclaiming…"

 sanghariyar.2.t:0 "A Temporary Solution"
 sanghariyar.2.desc:0 "Davharral was once irrigated by a great aqueduct that brought water down from the Paravimvata mountains. The aqueduct was destroyed many decades ago, and our people have struggled ever since. The arid climate has worn down our water stores, and we now rely heavily upon traders bringing water into the city to survive, a dangerous precedent. \n\nRecently, a study found that there is an underground aquifer beneath one of the city suburbs. We must build wells as a matter of urgency to tap this water source and alleviate our reliance on the traders. It has been pointed out by several prospectors that the aquifer will only barely meet the city’s current needs, and a more permanent solution will be needed in the future."
 sanghariyar.2.a:0 "These wells will buy us time to find a solution."

 sanghariyar.3.t:0 "Vengeance Served"
 sanghariyar.3.desc:0 "In 1333, barely more than a century ago, the armies of the other Raghamidesh kingdoms retreated from the Battle of the Bloody Gate, abandoning us to the Raja’s will. Despite Ramapalar’s death mere days later, our people had been shackled into the raj, never again to dream of uniting our people beneath our banner. \n\nFate, however, had other plans it seems, for today it is our banners flying above the great cities of our former allies. It is our armies that unified our homelands. It is OUR king who united the Raghamidesh people, not the cowardly descendents of those who abandoned us. We suffered beneath the oppressive weight of the raj and its failing bureaucracy while the coastal states grew fat and plump from their Sarhali investments. It is only just that our people share in this wealth now. We will sack these greedy cities, and share their spoils amongst our people who suffered their betrayal."
 sanghariyar.3.a:0 "They will reap what they sowed, vengeance will be served!"

 sanghariyar.4.t:0 "Sack of Sramaya"
 sanghariyar.4.desc:0 "Sramaya, the jewel of the Rahen coast, a magnificent city of wealth and opulence built upon the backs of slaves; and the heart of the Bhuvauri state who would destroy our people and take our lands if given the chance. The siege was long and brutal, the slave soldiers of the enemy refusing to surrender, fighting tooth and nail for every city street. They fought valiantly, but in the end they lost, our soldiers victorious. Some fighting still persists in the slums and lower portions of the city, but the writing is on the wall, Sramaya is ours. \n\nAll was well as the night fell, the sounds of fighting gradually dying out as the sound of celebration and triumphant soldiers rose throughout the city. It looked as though the city would suffer little in the transfer of power. But then, in the blink of an eye, it all fell apart. The city ablaze, soldiers plundering and looting shops, industries and homes alike. The sounds of celebration were replaced with that of a city being sacked, as the smell of smoke polluted the air. \n\nBy the time the sun rose, the city smouldered, its people weeping with the despair of the night’s events, the once great jewel, tarnished forever as its wealth was ripped from it, carried home by the armies of it’s conquerors."
 sanghariyar.4.a:0 "A tragic end to a city once so great.."

 sanghariyar.5.t:0 "Restoring the Flow"
 sanghariyar.5.desc:0 "The water crisis in Davharral has plagued the city, and by extension our kingdom, for over a century. The wells dug decades ago have eased the strain, but the crisis still persists, a never ending burden upon our citizens. It is time to end this crisis. The great aqueduct must be rebuilt, for so long as it remains in ruins, our plight will never end. It’s reconstruction will be no easy feat, it will take a great deal of resources and time, but it must be done. Already some of our brightest minds from the new university have drafted proposed plans for how best to rebuild and repair the viaduct, with some even suggesting it could be extended to other provinces too. For now, our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has approved the plan to restore flow to Davharral alone and the groundworks have already begun."
 sanghariyar.5.a:0 "The water must flow!"

 sanghariyar.6.t:0 "Aqueduct Rebuilt"
 sanghariyar.6.desc:0 "It is a glorious day in Davharral, as the sound of rushing water is heard throughout the main concourse, as water flows overhead in one of the aqueducts' many channels. Citizens cry out in joy, celebrating the return of running water to the city, a feat long thought impossible, now a reality. Our ruler stands upon a hill overlooking the city, watching with a smile as water cascades through the many channels throughout the city, glistening in the bright light of the sun. It was no small task rebuilding the aqueduct, in many places the damage from time and age was so severe it was easier to rebuild from scratch than salvage what was left. \n\nNevertheless, it was done. Running water had been restored, and the crisis had been resolved in the city for now. Alternative solutions would be needed in the future, should the mountain reservoirs ever run low, but that was a problem for another time. Our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], unrolled the parchment drawings they had received from the university earlier that morning, detailing an extension for the aqueduct into Arrtukerr and Keruhar. Such an endeavour would be vastly more expensive, but after witnessing the beauty of the water below, the only logical answer was clear."
 sanghariyar.6.a:0 "The hinterlands must be irrigated too, the extension must be built."

 sanghariyar.7.t:0 "Lime Roofs"
 sanghariyar.7.desc:0 "”A revolutionary breakthrough has come from our university. A scholar has found a way to create roof tiles that allow water to pass through into channels within to be collected in containers or receptacles. The magnitude of this breakthrough can’t be understated, this could be the key to ending the water crisis forever! Replacing the roofs of each building in our lands with these tiles and constructing underground reservoirs would make our water supplies near limitless, with water stored abundantly throughout towns and cities. Of course, this discovery would also sell for an incredible price to some of our likewise water-deprived neighbours. What shall we do your majesty?”"
 sanghariyar.7.a:0 "Replace every roof in the city at once!"
 sanghariyar.7.b:0 "Sell the technology!"

 sanghariyar.8.t:0 "Question of Faith"
 sanghariyar.8.desc:0 "Suhan has called into question many tenets of the High Philosophy and a heated debate rages in the Hall of Endless Debate as to which faith is the correct interpretation of the High Gods' will. \n\nOn one hand, our path to purtana has always been clear under the teachings of the Silk Turban. We must generate wealth and invest it in ways that best benefit both the state and its people. This is our nikitamarja in life, and to not do so is to condemn our material soul. \n\nOn the other hand, Suhan has exposed flaws in our understanding of the nature of the High Gods and their will. Not to mention that the structure of High Philosophy inherently benefits and promotes the status quo and peoples place in society, and within the castes. With no side gaining an advantage over the other, and tensions beginning to rise, our ruler must settle the debate. They believe..."

Now we have to choose between sacrificing our freedom to them, or fighting when a whole contingent of their army is already within our capital!"

However, they could never have guessed just how deep our spies had infiltrated our “allies”. No state secret was safe, no vault locked, no battle tactic or stratagem unknown. Their rulers are little more than puppets, manipulated by our diplomats in the shadows, blackmailing, extorting and threatening any who stand in their way. But after tonight, they will be in the shadows no longer. This game has gone on long enough, it is time we strike and secure our control over these puppets. The soldiers are in place, having slowly entered the cities in disguise over the last month, hiding in safehouses scattered in the capital. Tonight, our allies will become our subjects, for their own good. \n\nDespite what many say, it is never personal. It is simply business, our business just deals in blood as much as in gold."
 sanghariyar.10.a:0 "The game was rigged from the start."

 sanghariyar.11.t:0 "Sack of Dhenijansar"
 sanghariyar.11.desc:0 "”When Ramapalar subjugated us back in 1333, I imagine he could never have imagined this.”, our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] said as they looked out over Dhenijansar from their vantage point. The columns of soldiers pouring through the breaches in the walls, opened by cannons forged from Shenrali steel. Staring at the golden palace, standing opulent over the city in the distance, our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] spoke softly, “First, we punished our brothers and sisters for deserting us all those years ago. Now, we will punish those who enslaved us.” With a cold look in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] eyes, they turned to their general, “Burn it. Burn it all.”, and turned from the field as the clashing of swords rang out and men screamed."

 sanghariyar.13.desc:0 "The High Gods built the high temples, structures of such beauty and majesty no mortal has ever been able to recreate their magnificence. That won’t stop us from trying, however. Our empire’s ascension to power has opened resources and wealth to us that could not have been conceived in the past. In the name of the Ones Above we must build a new palace for a ruler so magnificent that they themselves would wish to reside there if they walked among us. No expense will be spared, no imperfection tolerated. We will build a palace fit for a God, so opulent and beautiful it will rival the high temples themselves!"

 sanghariyar.14.desc:0 "In less than an hour, dwarven warriors from here will join others from around the region. And we will be launching one of the largest organised campaigns of settlement and conquest in the history of dwarvenkind. "Dwarvenkind." That word should have new meaning for all of us today. We can't be consumed by our petty differences anymore. We will be united in our common interests. Perhaps it's fate that this month is [GetMonth], and you will once again be fighting for our freedom... Not from tyranny, oppression, or persecution... but from cultural annihilation. We are fighting for our right to live in our home. To exist. And should we win the day, [GetMonth] will no longer be known as a Peridot holiday, but as the day the dwarven world declared in one voice: "We will not go quietly into the night!" We will not vanish without a fight! We're going to live on! We're going to survive! Today we celebrate our Reclamation Day!"
 sanghariyar.14.a:0 "Life before death!"

 sanghariyar.15.t:0 "Shenrali Steel"
 sanghariyar.15.desc:0 "For many years, Shenral has produced some of the best steel in all of Rahen, perhaps even Haless itself. This steel, however, never made it into the hands of the everyday soldier in our armies, not even our captains. No this steel was a luxury, only affordable to the most wealthy elites and awarded to the Kingsguard for their service. Capable of cutting through most armours like a hot knife through lard, scimitars and other weapons forged from shenrali steel are the envy of all weaponsmiths. \n\nThe secrets of this steel’s creation are closely guarded by the men and dwarves who manufacture it in the city of Shernal, in a quarter located just outside the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]’s keep. This has meant production of the steel was slow, never keeping up with demand for the elites, let alone able to supply our troops. This has been the status quo for as long as many remember, but that is about to change. \n\nOur imperial possessions have provided us with resources and capital that would have been unattainable barely a century ago. This new found wealth, alongside our booming dwarven population has presented us with an opportunity to create a great forge to produce the steel en masse. Buried deep within the bowels of the city, and operated by the dwarves, with occasional humans sworn to secrecy, we will be able to keep the secrets of its production from prying eyes, while making enough steel to equip every soldier in our armies, no matter their rank."
 sanghariyar.15.a:0 "We will construct a forge in the likeness of those of Aul-Dwarov"

 sanghariyar.16.t:0 "Emulation of the High Gods"
 sanghariyar.16.desc:0 "The high temple of Sarkhashabid has always been a masterwork of beauty, crafted by the hands of the High Gods themselves. As of late, however, it has been noted that many of its embellishments and ornamentations have begun to dull, fading with age. This is an embarrassment upon our state and the people of Sarkhashabid. How can we claim to be walking the path to purtana when the wealth we amass can’t even keep our great temple looking ornate?! \n\nAnd so it was, that a restorative plan was issued. A commission of the most skilled artisans and artists in our realm was assembled, tasked with drafting a plan to beautify the temple once more, restoring her to her former glory, with no budget limits. The draft went through many iterations before a final draft landed upon the desk of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], including an artist depiction of the proposed final product. \n\nIt was beautiful. Polished white marble lined the walls of the temple. Pillars made of solid slabs of jade chiselled into the many faces of the High Gods adorned the halls and chambers. Masterful artworks from every corner of our empire, displayed in frames of mahogany and teak wood hung from the walls, trimmed with gold linings. This was the reason the Silk Turban preached that wealth should be acquired; not so it could be hoarded, but so it could be invested into projects such as this. This was to be a masterwork of creation, and without so much as a bat of an eye, our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] approved the draft, not so much as glancing at the costing sheets attached."
 sanghariyar.16.a:0 "A temple worthy of the Ones Above once more!"

 sanghariyar.17.t:0 "Impregnable Beauty"
 sanghariyar.17.desc:0 "The fortress of Sardika has always stood proudly at the tip of the peninsula, a bastion for our people, undeterred no matter the odds. In recent years, the once mighty fortress has begun to show its age. Large sections of the walls show clear signs of structural damage, from cracks to chunks missing from bricks, even holes in some parts. It is high time the fortress was renovated. \n\nBut why just renovate the fortress, our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] pondered, staring at the many architectural drawings and diagrams. “This is our chance to do better.”, they spoke, commanding that the fortress was to be as much a piece of art as it was a defensive structure, the envy of all the royal keeps across Haless. The final product would not disappoint. \n\nHard granite blocks formed the exterior walls, cut so precisely that the walls looked as if they were made from a whole solid piece of stone almost ten feet thick. Banners made of silk, emblazoned with the national flag and the royal family’s sigil, draped from the walls, fluttering softly in the wind. The tops of the walls are outfitted with cannons made of shenrali steel, with shieldings made of iron and stone to protect them from damage. From a distance, the fortress seemed as if moulded out of solid stone by Pathim himself, a beautiful, shiny masterwork of fortification and artistry intertwined. This was a fortress worthy of the High Gods, and one that would stand the test of time."
