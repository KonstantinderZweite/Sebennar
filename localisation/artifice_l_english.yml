 artifice_events.1.d:0 "There are three broad schools of thought, or philosophies, in how to approach artificery.\n\nThe Philosophy of Brilliant Inventions seek to fulfil the promise of true synthesis between magic and technology, blending the two into creating things entirely new and all the more capable. The Brillites see themselves at the forefront of the science of artifice, and it is no surprise that the most wildest and ingenious inventions come from followers of this philosophy. Their most famous invention is the Sparkdrive Rifle which utilizes elemental essence to shoot lightning with marksman accuracy.\n\nThe Philosophy of Techno-Thaumaturgy see artificery as a new school of magic, treating it through the lens of pragmatic mysticism as the common wizard would. They see artificery as a tool to bridge the gap between the arcane and the mundane, often using artifice to replicate spells without the need of complex rituals and reagents. One such invention are Wandlocks, allowing spells to be fired from the barrel of a pistol.\n\nThe Philosophy of Mechanism are engineers and craftsmen who combine artifice and traditional engineering know-how to push the limits of machinery. Mechanists stereotypically treat the more fantastical applications of artifice with disdain, believing in simple and effective artifice, especially when it can help with mass production. The Mechanists are proud that it is often their inventions that revolutionize society, such as Skyships.\n\nSupporting one of these philosophies will determine what Invention the Artificers hired by our state will create for us.

After all, is artificery not the future? If so, why are we stuck looking at the past?

 artificer_factions.9.d:0 "The ever-fickle, ever-eccentric and ever-annoying Brillites have gone to sulk again. With their faction scorned from the running of the country, many have completely lost interest in the affairs of the state, simply returning to their workshops to work on pet projects that will never see the light of day."
 artificer_factions.9.a:0 "Remind them of their obligations"

 artificer_factions.10.t:0 "Technomancer Intrigues Pay Off"
 artificer_factions.10.d:0 ""These Technomancers. Don't trust 'em. They've like conniving mages, but smarter. 'Cos they caught on with the times."\n\nIndeed so. The many intrigues, plots and half-plots of the Technomancers slowly but surely power in the state has paid off. Eventually you realize that a few Technomancers have appeared in place of officials who have recently resigned, suspiciously disappeared or banished over spelling mistakes in their theses."
 artificer_factions.10.a:0 "We must move swiftly against this"
 artificer_factions.10.b:0 "That's politics, I guess"
 artificer_factions.11.t:0 "Mechanists Call Favours"
 artificer_factions.11.d:0 "In the ancient tale of the Tortoise and the Hare, the Mechanists are the tortoise. They are slow and steady. Resolute. Their influence creeps deep in the foundations of the country.\n\nNeed a solid mechanic? They're a Mechanist. Oh, you need someone to design a sturdy core for your invention? Get a Sending Stone to the Mechanists.\n\nIt seems now is the time that the Mechanists have looked to have their favours repayed, and have pulled strings to gain strength within our bureaucratic offices."
 artificer_factions.11.a:0 "Hold on. We don't do that here."
 artificer_factions.11.b:0 "If people want to help them, then fine"
 artificer_factions.12.t:0 "Mechanists Strip Mining Damestear"
 artificer_factions.12.d:0 "Damestear is raw magic condensed into a stone, and as such incredibly useful as power sources in the field of artificery.\n\nThe Mechanists in our realm have been undertaking initiatives to mine as much damestear as they can within our provinces. The Brillites, fickle as always, have complained that such careless mining will simply lower the quality of the damestear they harvest, making it 'practically useless' in their eyes."
 artificer_factions.12.a:0 "We must gather damestear carefully."
 artificer_factions.12.b:0 "A rock is a rock. Mine it."
