Its rim, known as the Cliffs of Ruin, can only be climbed through perilous natural paths, or with the help of pulley systems the construction of which requires days to make. Neither of these solutions is practical for constant trading or for the passage of armies. By pooling enough resources, we will be able to build a passage that will greatly ease travel from up and down the cliffs, and we will be the sole masters of it."
