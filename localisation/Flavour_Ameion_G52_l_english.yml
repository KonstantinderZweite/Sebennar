 G52_echate_league_title: "The Échate League"
 G52_echate_league_desc: "The nékheis were founded by the kheions over a millennium ago for the twin purposes of seeking resource-rich lands, and settling homesteads in such places for the overflow population of our overcrowded cities. Our own origins lie in the nékheis, and we have always preferred diplomacy with them, if nothing else due to their proximity.\n\n[G62.GetName] recently found itself without a kheion overlord due to the fall of [G61.GetName], and this gives us an opportunity to create an alliance between the two of us and our respective nékheis: [G56.GetName]. With our leadership, the Andic Reach could become a new center of power in the Kheionai world: The Échate League."
 G52_establish_borders_title: "Establish Borders"
 G52_establish_borders_desc: "The first matter to settle to secure the prosperity of the Échate League is to ensure we are on the same page regarding our settling of the Andic Reach. The kheions have long squabbled with each other for the coastline of the Devand, and we must ensure such petty disputes do not fracture us as it has them."
 G52_common_military_title: "Common Military"
 G52_common_military_desc: "Our friends in the Échate League are useful to have as allies, but as Laskaris ruled our city alone, they lack the military standards we have come to expect. We shall organize their armies to our standards, and in the process take the opportunity to cross-reference tactics, mutually developing more effective methods of combat."
 G52_united_diplomacy_title: "United Diplomacy"
 G52_united_diplomacy_desc: "The Échate League settles along common borders, fights with common tactics, and champions the same causes. The only thing left is to unify our efforts diplomatically once and for all.\n\nNaturally, as the largest member of the League, we are the one best suited to lead this common effort, and under our guidance our two compatriots will share in our glory."
 G52_echate_union_title: "Échate Union"
 G52_echate_union_desc: "Many already consider the Échate nations as one, even those that live within them. As we centralize the Devand into one nation, the cities of [G62.GetName] and [G56.GetName] shall always hold a special place within it. They saw the merit of unity amongst the Kheionai people, led by the Devandi rather than the Alecandi. With them by our side, Ameion shall bring its peace to all Kheionai."
 G52_liberate_mainland_title: "Liberate the Mainland"
 G52_liberate_mainland_desc: "The nékheis, founded centuries ago by the kheions, have never known self rule. They have served as colonies of the kheions, existing to take in those who could not fit within the warded walls. We too seek dominion over these cities, but as our ancestors once hailed from them, we know them to be our kin. We once tried to unite them under a crown, but now they shall rule autonomously under our wing."
 G52_southern_toll_title: "End the Southern Toll"
 G52_southern_toll_desc: "Ruinborn as a whole are not too fond of traveling on open water. Fortunately for the Kheionai, the Cleaved Sea is relatively shallow, and full of islands that allow journeys never to venture too far from land. The southernmost of them, the islands of [2716.GetName], have served as a major choke point of trade between the Cleaved Sea and Taychend for centuries.\n\nThe Kheionai are among the most maritime of the Ruinborn, and as their principal nation, we must control the sea that gave us this tradition."
 G52_peace_war_title: "By Peace or War"
 G52_peace_war_desc: "The kheions, the epicenter of the kheionai world, have stood for over a millennium, and quite possibly well beyond that. Our ancestors emerged from them, and it is only appropiate that as we present ourself as the sole nation-state of the kheionai, the kheions themselves acknowledge that fact. Even in the unlikely event they posed a unified front against us, we would triumph over them, and this is clear to them as well.\n\nBringing peace and stability to the deathwind-plagued isle may prove as simple as stationing our armies and fleets nearby and making a demand, but defiance may yet stir them against us just as it has to others."
 G52_motherland_kneels_title: "Motherland Kneels"
 G52_motherland_kneels_desc: "The heartland of the kheionai world is now submitted to our rule. By the principles of Kheionism, these great cities are the prime example of how urban life should be conducted, and thus allowing them to do so with autonomy in their respective kheions will prove culturally beneficial."
 G52_custodian_of_cities_title: "Custodian of Cities"
 G52_custodian_of_cities_desc: "To Ameion, conquest brings responsibility - and the conquest of the west brings perhaps the greatest responsibility of all: custodianship of the Kheions, the cradles of Kheionai civilisation. The crucibles of art, science, history and trade, of prosperity and above all philosophy, it is our duty to protect and invest in the cities of the Cleaved Sea. Only then can our rule truly be justified - only then can we shape the future of Kheionai civilisation as a whole."
 
 G52_approach_mteibhar_title: "Approach the Mteibhar"
 G52_approach_mteibhar_desc: "The Mteibhar gather in their valley peacefully every once in a while to partake in their religious practices. If we were to attend one of these gatherings, we could use their banner of peace to conduct diplomacy with their leadership and lay the groundwork for their incorporation under Ameion like the Taychendi.\n\nThey will not submit voluntarily, but knowing and respecting their customs will relieve any tensions their subjugation will create."
 G52_embrace_humble_title: "Embrace the Humble"
 G52_embrace_humble_desc: "The Devandi value their liberty highly, but as far as the average man is concerned, what matters most is their day-to-day life. We may win easy victories over their armies, but what will keep them from rising again shall be the efforts we take to improve their lives under our rule. There may be glory in raiding, but they shall learn the comforts of a well-tended field."
 G52_western_borders_title: "The Western Borders" # takasaki
 G52_western_borders_desc: "It is Ameion's duty to pacify the Chendhya's raiders for good - but there are others who have also dedicated themselves to the task. The western border region of Taychend, the Guaraddhi, is home to various cities which have spent centuries dealing with the Chendhyans - perhaps it is time to tend to this frontier, and get a leg-up on our fight to secure the steppe?"
 G52_vanguard_taychend_title: "Vanguard of Taychend" # takasaki
 G52_vanguard_taychend_desc: "Every people and state bordering the Chendhya knows it as the spawning ground of dread raiders, who surge from the steppe riding big cats, bringing destruction upon all. Certainly, Rakkabuttai's Bloodcloaks see the Chendhyans themselves as nothing more than thieves and bandits - but we know that there is potential in all peoples, if uncultivated. Perhaps the Bloodcloaks, who profess to be the vanguard of Taychend, can be the stick to our carrot, and we can bring some more Chendhyans on board with our vision?"
 G52_children_valley_title: "Children of the Valley"
 G52_children_valley_desc: "So long as there are Devandi tribes not under our rule, they will continue to raid and pillage each other, fouling each other's hopes of a brighter future. If we are to allow true growth across the Devand, we must extend our rule across it.\n\nThe tribes all trace their origin to a common point, so this burgeoning civilization has the identity necessary to unify."
 G52_summit_ameion_title: "Summit of Ameion"
 G52_summit_ameion_desc: "Ameion has become a patchwork of peoples from the steppes of the Chendhya to the hills of Taychend with our glorious kheion at the heart of it all. Trade routes that were once perilous are now commonly traversed, and while the language of the kheions is becoming gradually adopted across Andeios, the cultures that exist in our periphery are still distinct.\n\nAs the principal city of this state, it is our duty to bring together the peoples of our city into one identity. Let us gather representatives of our various ways of life to knit the separate threads into a common quilt."
 G52_andic_brethren_title: "Andic Brethren"
 G52_andic_brethren_desc: "Unlike any other people in these lands, the kheionai are uniquely accepting of the waters. While even we do not often dare to venture over the open sea, we frequently sail along the coastlines of Alecand, Devand, and Taychend to trade with others.\n\nUnder our leadership, these coastlines have become safer and more profitable to those who sail them. The interconnectivity fostered by this trade has strengthened ties between our holdings, and it is us kheionai who make these journeys."
 G52_devandi_brethren_title: "Devandi Brethren"
 G52_devandi_brethren_desc: "While Taychend was a difficult beast to tame, Devand has proven even fiercer. This is because while the average Devandi had less than the average Taychendi, they were comparatively happier with their way of life before our arrival.\n\nBut we did not allow them to stagnate in their comfort. While they took pride in their raiding skills, we taught them to empathize with the victims of such violence. While their peaks and rivers provided them plenty of water, we taught them irrigation to provide them even more. Our brothers here have come far, but there is farther yet to go."
 G52_frontier_tamed_title: "The Frontier Tamed"
 G52_frontier_tamed_desc: "The wild steppe of the Chendhya has always been richer than most give it credit for - how else, after all, would the Chendhyans be able to sustain hordes of big cats in the way that they have? But it was also a wild and untamed land, where ancient privileges stood in place of civic laws. The Chendhyans lived free - but they lived in chaos. We could not allow this situation to stand. By dismantling the ancient tribes and their way of life in the same way we did in Taychend, we have tamed what was once thought untamable. The Chendhyans are no more, and now the Astolbhen may rise - with a little aid from Ambhen settlers, of course."
 G52_land_chaos_title: "Land of Chaos"
 G52_land_chaos_desc: "At the turn of the millennium, an Oktíbhen expeditionary army landed on Amadia's shores - they brought back tales of swirling, surging storms of uncontrollable wild magic, that had left even the inhabitants themselves prism-marked . They also brought back untold riches in silver and damestear. When the time came once more for Oktíkheion to sail north in desperation, it would be those riches that would drive them - and that chaos that would destroy them. We Kheionai have first-hand experience with the harshness of Amadia. Perhaps it is time to use our power to do something about it, and order the land of chaos?"
 G52_godless_order_title: "Godless Order"
 G52_godless_order_desc: "Where we go, order follows. The foundations first laid by Laskaris and his companions have now been successfully built on - the fires of superstition have been extinguished, and the storm of chaos subdued. And by taking the lessons we have learnt from east and west, we may finally be able to bring the light of godless order to the north - for through command of both the magic of the world and the beliefs of the soul, we can bend even the most destructive manifestations of the Ruin to our will."
 
 G52_antrayenthi_title: "Antrayénthi" # takasaki
 G52_antrayenthi_desc: "Laskaris' conquests in Taychend have given us a sense of history like nothing has done before. Everywhere we march, we see the remains of not only Taychend's many empires, but those of the Slaver-Nobles who ruled before the Ruin as well. Their majestic ruins and terrible legacy have sparked in our scholars an unparalleled interest in the Imperial Precursors, who built the original Kheions and once ruled Taychend from the skies. By investigating the Precursors, perhaps we can rediscover our former greatness - and uncover the role that greatness plays in our new mission in Taychend."
 G52_kheion_past_title: "Kheion Past Alecand"
 G52_kheion_past_desc: "Ameion has grown as a kheion significantly in recent years, fueled by the wealth of Taychend. In many ways it has become superior to the so-called ‘true' kheions of the west, and it is time we gain recognition for this. Bringing representatives from Alecand to showcase our mighty capital will prove to them the kheionai lifestyle is attainable even beyond their home island."
 G52_nation_state_title: "The Nation State"
 G52_nation_state_desc: "The Kylakas of the west dream of a unified state; those in Alecand seek to overthrow their peers and unite their island. Our ancestors in Devand dreamed of uniting the nékheis into a united front free from the control of the homeland. Now, we have built our own state, one that has weakened the barrier between the Kheionai, the Devandi, and the Taychendi.\n\nThere is work to be done before these segments of our society are united, but the foundations have been made for a state primed to rule all of these lands, and to unite them all under one identity."
 G52_new_cities_title: "New Cities"
 G52_new_cities_desc: "As we continue our expansion into lands once held by the Bashobhar, our duty to bring prosperity to these lands comes with us. Where there were once scattered tribes no different than those present when the kheions first settled the nékheis, there will stand new cities, centers of progress in the Devandi interior."
 G52_basis_civilization_title: "Basis of Civilization"
 G52_basis_civilization_desc: "As we continue to coax the Taychendi people away from their destructive deities, disbanding their cults and seizing temple lands, we have also begun enforcing the ways of the Kheionai. Their farms, once organised into communal villages ruled by minor warlords, have been granted to Ambhen settlers and loyal collaborators on a hereditary basis. While irrigation has enabled their already mighty population to blossom, the imposition of serfdom, and thus controls on internal movement, has secured the countryside from bandits and rebels. Soon, the Taychendi will know the gifts of Kheionai civilisation!"
 G52_closing_cycle_title: "Closing of the Cycle"
 G52_closing_cycle_desc: "The Cycle of Warlords inherent to Taychendi history - conquest, consolidation, and collapse - will continue to occur so long as multiple independent realms  exist in Taychend. Though much of this war-torn land is under our rule, northern Taychend still remains under the control of warlords.Though we know it is baseless superstition, already many among the Taychendi believe that our victory is predestined, and that we will end the Cycle of Glory for good, ushering in a new world of order. Perhaps they are right in that last conviction - soon, we will put this state of affairs to an end, and finish what Laskaris started."
 G52_ways_of_west_title: "Ways of the West"
 G52_ways_of_west_desc: "The Taychendi refer to us as the west, and Taychendi who have adopted our customs proudly style themselves as Klereyen, westerners. The preservation of the kheions in the face of armageddon has established them as the truest conservation of what came before, and as the Taychendi tore each other apart, we Kheionai set out to rebuild this world.\n\nWe have honed this craft over centuries, and now in the face of the ruins of Taychend, we have the expertise to restore these lands to the glory that once existed here. We may be from their West, but with our guidance they will someday be the people pushing outwards to rebuild in another direction, and truly be Klereyen."
 G52_roof_taychend_title: "Roof of Taychend" # takasaki
 G52_roof_taychend_desc: "The time has come to march into the Laranakarha Highlands and once and for all prevent any future resistance from emanating from the region. With Larankar broken, we merely need to clean up the fragments left in their wake. Of particular interest are the rugged hills of northern Larankar, home to the Advakhalla. They profess descent from Tacenie - proven by those among them with rainbow hair - and truthfully are not as bloodthirsty as the southerners, making them prime candidates for Kheionisation. Their skill at Kattyam in particular, a method of fighting using sabres as spell-foci, may make them a valuable part of our empire indeed...."
 G52_taychendi_brethren_title: "Taychendi Brethren"
 G52_taychendi_brethren_desc: "When destruction came to Taychend, its people proved unable to permanently restore that which existed here, instead cyclically tearing down whatever they accomplished. We do not hate them for this, but it has necessitated our intervention to bring glory back to these lands.\n\nIt took our people centuries to make the most of the kheions against the Kaydhano, and here we do not even know for what purpose its wonders were built. But we do know that so long as we work alongside the Taychendi, we will help them become as distinguished as us."
 G52_nakyra_kheion_title: "Nákyra, the Kheion" # rewritten by taka
 G52_nakyra_kheion_desc: "Many would argue that no city not built by the Kheionai can earn the title of 'Kheion', but it is becoming clear that the Precursors who built the kheions are the one and same as those who laid the foundations of Nákyra - even though they shared in its construction with the infamous Slaver-Nobles.\n\nSince then, the city has been transformed into a warren of slums and Taychendi temples, winding through the Precursor constructions - but once the city is cleaned and remodeled, even more than the city of Ameion Nákyra will stand as a testament to the might of both the Kheionai and of those who came before us."
 G52_administrative_centers_title: "Administrative Centers"
 G52_administrative_centers_desc: "Ameion has come to be sovereign over vast expanses of steppe, forest and farmland - naturally, one city cannot rule over all this alone, and so since the days of Laskaris the Empire has been broken up into semi-autonomous provinces, called Epaidía. But these provinces rely on strong urban capitals, in which local democracy and government is based, to maintain order - as their size and power grows, so do the challenges of administration. We must see our administration bolstered across these territories, lest the rule of law and power of the kheion be doubted in regions that once held no notion of the capabilities of  civilization."
 G52_unity_last_title: "Unity at Last"
 G52_unity_last_desc: "When the Kheionai set out from their kheions to settle the Devand, it was known even then that their objective was to restore civilization to the mainland. What was not known at the time was just how massive an undertaking this would be.\n\nAs the old kheions began to fight amongst themselves, this higher purpose was lost to our people. It was Laskaris the Conqueror who called Ameion back to this duty, and he set the stage for his nation to bring order and prosperity to both Taychend and the Devand, ensuring peace across all Alecand. After centuries of turmoil, [Root.GetName] stands as a nation the Ruinborn can take pride in, one that stands proudly on the shoulders of the Precursors, knowing every victory brings us closer to their glory.\n\nMuch of Aelantir stands occupied by the humans of Cannor and 'Elves' which claim a legacy they willingly abandoned, but so long as [Root.GetName] stands, the truth shall remain that it is us who have rightfully inherited this mantle."
 G52_second_reflection_title: "Second Age of Reflection"
 G52_second_reflection_desc: "Simply looking at the rest of Aelantir - at the other so-called ''great civilisations'' that arose from the ashes of the Precursors - is enough to make any patriotic Ambhen sick. Everything Ameion has done has been in the service of embodying the legacy of our ancestors, resurrecting the glory and the order of Old Elven rule. But so far, we have merely been doing so under the guise of Ameion, and that can suffice no longer. We shall enact a grand gesture - a proclamation of Restoration - and in doing so, we shall kickstart the second age of Reflection... under the auspices of a reunited Elven Empire."
 
 G52_lords_gopatri_title: "Lords of Gopatri"
 G52_lords_gopatri_desc: "Our foothold has been established, but there is much more to be done. To the west lies Imarchend, a kingdom populated by nobles that claim direct descent from the Slaver-Nobles of old, a kingdom at the edge of the Sarihaddu desert, a kingdom centered around the fertile lands that hug the Gopatri River, and a kingdom ruled by fools. Most importantly, our new subjects in Korrimutren desire their lands. Let us march west and finish them off, and appease the Korrimutreni at the same time."
 G52_river_settlements_title: "River Settlements" # taka
 G52_river_settlements_desc: "The southern coast of Taychend has been well visited by Kheionai traders for over eight hundred years, its urban, wealthy cities slightly more sheltered from the chaos of Taychend than most. That kinship has made them prime targets for integration into our empire, with Nagar Vyechei, the second biggest city in Taychend, a very enticing candidate for our eastern capital. There is, of course, another factor - Nagar Vyechei is home to the Nila Tenvach, or Blue House, the premier Taychendi magical institution. By seizing the city, and appeasing the House's archmages, we may be able to massively expand our own magical power..."
 G52_the_fotistrepei_title: "The Fotistrépei"
 G52_the_fotistrepei_desc: "Taychend is a massive place, tens of millions calling its lands home even in its most chaotic periods. The Taychendi are a warlike people, always ready to mobilise and march off to war. This combination may ruin us, swallow our armies whole as our technological and tactical advantage wanes, or, if we are smart, it may propel us yet further. An important minority of the Taychendi are gradually taking to Kheionisation. By inducting these into special auxiliary regiments, loyal to Ameion - and isolated from their peers by their affiliation with us - we can raise a massive force to defend our territories and bolster our field armies. Already, the Stratéor are calling these new soldiers ''the Fotistrepei.''"
 G52_secure_south_title: "Secure the South"
 G52_secure_south_desc: "From Korrimutren to Vuls Tenvach our banner flies, and civilization is being built. Now we must consolidate our rule here, for we must not leave our backs open to dissidents in a conquered land. Once the consolidation is finished, we will march north and continue what Laskaris and his brave soldiers started. "
 G52_across_hills_title: "Line Across Rolling Hills"
 G52_across_hills_desc: "A line is drawn across Taychend; on one side there is Larankar, the would-be unifier of Taychend. On the other side are we, the 'foreign interloper' meddling in their plans for domination. We both claim to fight for peace, but it is only we who can truly provide it.\n\nWhat makes us different is that Larankar fights within the framework of Taychendi barbarism; they do not hesitate to brutalize those who would stand against them, and ultimately seek only to enrich themselves. We need not such petty goals; we will upend the warlords infesting these lands, and establish a rule here worthy of the legacy of those who came before us."
 G52_river_taychend_title: "River of Taychend"
 G52_river_taychend_desc: "For most of the many centuries since the Ruin, the Kalavend has been the heartland of Taychendi civilisation, home to imposing cities, cultural wonders and sprawling kingdoms. This region contains the highest concentration of relics within Taychend, littered as it is with Precursor ruins - the famous, magnificent city of Nanru Nakar chief among them. If we pacify and Kheionize the Kalavend, it will surely become one of the centres of our empire, its rich fields protected and cultivated by Kheionai laws. All we must do is conquer it!"
 G52_twilight_title: "Twilight"
 G52_twilight_desc: "The Exemplars pretend to have the same goals as us. They say they want to banish the darkness of chaos from Taychend - but their admittedly commendable strength is only matched by their foolishness. Their ancestors deserted this land a millennium ago, and by simply thinking they can butcher and incinerate their way to order, they have proven they know nothing of what is truly necessary. Therefore, we need to halt their advance, and set their blazing sun of righteousness once and for all."
 G52_last_port_title: "The Last Free Port"
 G52_last_port_desc: "Orenkoraim has long evaded our rule, propped up by Cannorians seeking to exploit our people for their own profits. They take pride in this so-called 'independence', calling themselves the 'Free Port' of Taychend. But it is clear to all they are traitors to their kind, and soon they shall be brought in line.\n\nThis will not prove easy, however. The Cannorians will go to great lengths to keep their foot in our door, and while they may not go as far as to fully invade us over the Free Port, they shall certainly send aid to their puppet."
 G52_naval_dominance_title: "Naval Dominance"
 G52_naval_dominance_desc: "The waters surrounded by our heartland, the Chendhya, and Taychend have come to bear our name. Fittingly, even the Cannorians with their ocean-sailing ships have struggled to stake a claim on our shores, as they have to our Ruinborn kin elsewhere.\n\nOur navy is the mightiest known natively in this continent, but if we are to keep the foreigners at bay, we must ensure we have the naval infrastructure necessary to bring respect from the Cannorians."
 G52_arcane_lumber_title: "Arcane Wood, Mystic Ashes"
 G52_arcane_lumber_desc: "Our quest for naval dominance has naturally brought us to the endless expanse of trees to our north. Integrating the secrets of the living jungle is not such a simple endeavor, however - whether we have decided to burn or tolerate the jungle, we will need to dedicate significant resources into understanding exactly how it works. Perhaps then, we can integrate the magics of the Effelai itself into our ships, and create the most powerful fleet the world has ever seen."
 G52_ancestral_legacy_title: "Ancestral Legacy"
 G52_ancestral_legacy_desc: "Since the Ruin itself, the Kheionai have whispered of Tacenie, the long lost flying city that once supported our ancestors. It was thought destroyed, its remnants scattered and surviving citizens disappeared into the chaos of Taychend - but now we know the truth. As we search Tacenie's nearly-intact form, fascination with the legacy of our ancestors has reached a fever pitch, as the citizens of Ameion delve into the arcane secrets of the Precursors. Perhaps it is time for the Synkletos to finally cast itself as the heir to Tacenie?"
 
 G52_collapse_aedzudar_title: "Collapse the Ezhudar"
 G52_collapse_aedzudar_desc: "Before our arrival, another Conqueror was making waves to the west. In the Guarradhi, Zaernsarlan II 'the Ravager' tore through the region at the head of the Ezhudar of Zaernmaera, his armies smashing all before him. A few of his bands even reached as far as the walls of Ameion itself. Thankfully for us, he is old, weak, and in his final years on this plane. And if his rumors are anything to go by, his son will not be the great general his father was. Still, Zaernmaera is a major threat to our ambitions in Taychend, and must be eliminated. We have sent out envoys to the Ezhudar's rivals, Oremvand and Rakkabuttai, who will gladly submit themselves to our new order in exchange for the destruction of their hated enemy. All we must do is march west, and defeat the riders of Zaernmaera in battle."
 G52_calm_before_title: "Calm Before the Storm"
 G52_calm_before_desc: "The west is secure, and now we must begin preparations for the Eastern Campaign. The realms we thrashed years ago to secure our foothold in Taychend have been preparing for the continuation of our conquest. It is time we finish them off and march onwards, for our destiny lies in Nákyra!"
 G52_eastern_campaign_title: "Eastern Campaign"
 G52_eastern_campaign_desc: "When Laskaris led us onto the shores of Taychend, Nagar Vyechei, Sthanan ith Vussam, Tirsin, and Gophira all resisted us - and at Bukénthia, Laskaris cast them aside, slaying the Gophiran King Dhalikar in single combat. While our victory was great, all of these states still stand to fight another day, and it is only a matter of time before they join together again in an attempt to drive us out. We must prepare faster than they can, and push our advantage while we still hold it."
 G52_collision_of_destiny_title: "Collision of Destiny"
 G52_collision_of_destiny_desc: "As Laskaris landed in Taychend, another great conqueror began his campaigns in the north - Erankar, King of Larankar. The northern hero has had his ups and downs, and for a time following his defeat outside Nanru Nakar it was believed his realm would collapse entirely - but he has proven nothing if not defiant.\n\nLaskaris knew his destiny would create a future for Ameion as a whole, but if that is to come to pass, we must face down this empire once and for all, and break it. We will not fail him."
 G52_place_exile_title: "Place of Exile"
 G52_place_exile_desc: "While the vast majority of Taychendi have benefitted from our rule, there are some who are adamant about their desire to rule themselves. Regardless of evidence to the contrary, they insist they would be better off without our intervention.\n\nThose of Vuls Tenvach have been more diplomatic, and offered a proposition: we shall fund and assist their efforts to settle an uninhabited island to the east, to which those discontented with our rule can exile themselves.\n\nWhile peculiar, having a place to put those with no hope of saving from their destructive ways may prove beneficial to the majority who remain here."
 G52_peace_coexistance_title: "Peace Through Coexistence"
 G52_peace_coexistance_desc: "Considering the size of this island, the fact that we have found no evidence of civilization here is quite interesting. While the Taychendi methods are crude, they are vastly superior than allowing the land to sit empty of cities. Under our authority, perhaps their culture can flourish into something other than a wasteland."
 G52_isle_severance_title: "The Isle of Severance"
 G52_isle_severance_desc: "What was intended to be a disposal bin for stubborn Taychendi has proven a profitable venture in and of itself. The taxation provided by the island's government has supplemented our treasury with little further effort needed on our end.\n\nEnsuring they have no worries of border conflicts will ensure this revenue goes uninterrupted, and allow any who resist our rule to live elsewhere while still paying their due."
 G52_faint_chorus_title: "The Faint Chorus"
 G52_faint_chorus_desc: "As we conquered those who inhabited the fringes of Taychend, we have begun to learn what little those peoples knew of the nightmarish jungle beyond the Veyii Sikarhi. Of particular interest are the Dugu'hi, who once ruled the mushroom forest to the north west - they state that the jungle sent monstrous troll-sized elves to exile them from their lands. These ''Lai'i'' exist on the other side of the mountains as well, and if what the Dugu'hi say is true then the jungle itself may be an enemy greater than anything we've seen. Perhaps it is time to launch some exploratory expeditions to probe this potential threat?"
 G52_shattering_crescendo_title: "The Shattering Crescendo"
 G52_shattering_crescendo_desc: "Our forays into the northern jungles have been met with a response unlike anything we predicted. Our worst fears were confirmed with each attack - the jungle itself seems to be alive. Even as we try to contend with the chaos of the jungle and the shattering crescendo of its response to our intrusion threatens to overwhelm us, some argue that perhaps this is not a fight that needs to be had - after all, has the hivemind itself not been a force of order?

 G52_ordered_symphony_desc: "The Effelai is in a way just another aspect of order, bringing a sick, twisted sort of stability to the jungles of South Aelantir. By allowing it to persist and dominate those within its jurisdiction, we can harness the power of the Effelai's Ordered Symphony, raising the strength of our new ally to dominate the foes of Ameion. Some are even saying we ought to give it honorary citizenship - but letting the jungle be seems to be the more proportionate reward."

 flavor_ameion.1.t: "Contemplation upon Vussam"
 flavor_ameion.1.d: "Laskaris gripped the side of the boat as it sailed into port. The city of Kiman Laskaris drew closer, and Taychend with it. Six years of war, four years of peace, and he had already transformed his strip of Taychend into something greater. He'd seized the great ruins of Kannalulthe, defeated the rump Gophirans at Bukénthia... but there was so much more to be done. He had learned how to conquer Taychend - now he just needed to do it.\n\nHe closed his eyes, took a deep breath - for a moment, he recalled his childhood. A Bharbhen father he never knew, a Kheionai mother ashamed of his existence. Destitute and dissolute. Then he remembered his travels in Taychend as a young man, saw in his mind's eye a Taychend in bloom - the river barges sailing full on the still water, the children at play in the furrowed fields, the passion and the beauty of their people. Then he remembered a Taychend at war - the devastation, the senseless war and violence, the burned villages and the charred bodies. He knew Taychend - knew its terrible faults, and its boundless glory - and he left knowing his purpose.\n\n''Laskaris,'' Kerodinsis Arpedan, his second in command, called from behind. ''I've brought a report from that nightblade, Lykos. Imarchend looks weak...''\nLaskaris nodded as he took it in hand, skimmed it, passed it back. ''I'll make my decision when we reach shore.'' Arpedan nodded back, turned on his heel and left. Laskaris had help. He had Kerodinsis, fighting by his side, Irenthenes and his wife Devenithe holding the fort in Ameion, loyal supporters like Lykos - and he had his soldiers, his comrades, those with whom he had shared so much pain and pride. He had an entire nation at his back. And yet...\n\nFifteen years stood between him and death, maybe almost Sixteen with luck. The skeletal form of the Fateweaver of Korrimutren had given him more than prophecy - it had given him certainty. And through certainty? Immortality. The clock ticked. He had fifteen years to expand his domains, fifteen years to build a state that lasts..."
 flavor_ameion.1.a: "...and fifteen years to fulfill his destiny."
 
 flavor_ameion.2.t: "Essence of Governance"
 flavor_ameion.2.d: "Laskaris and Kerodinsis Arpedan were discussing military matters when an albino Kheionai sauntered into the tent. Irenthenes Gakones, late as always, took a seat besides Kerodinsis like he owned the place. ''Long time no see, fellow Eilastes!''\n''Finally decided to grace us with your presence?'' Laskaris teased, grinning. Kerodinsis scoffed.\n\n''Well...'' the albino Kheionai chuckled, clapped his hands together, ''shall we start? The reason I'm here in Taychend, instead of walking the halls of power back in Ameion and schmoozing with your beautiful, neglected, cheated-on, Ormabhen-hustler of a wife, is that I've come up with a bit of what I call ''legal brilliance.'' You want to bring Kheionai-style cities to Taychend, but you want to keep your conquests Ameion's conquests, right? Well, under these proposals, the new Taychendi provinces, the Epaidía? They'll be legislatively autonomous - but their elected governors will be hooked in right to your office. You like them? They'll be confirmed by the Synkletos. You don't? You get to appoint one yourself.''\nKerodinsis cut in. ''And these governors are a strictly civilian role?''\nIrenthenes nodded. ''Eligible provincials will be conscripted straight into the state military. So civilisation for the people on the ground - but the Kylakas, Ameion, and the army still in a position to dominate! There are a few preparatory questions, though...'' Irenthenes passed some papers over. ''Things I wanted your opinion on.''\n\nLaskaris skimmed the documents - they were proposals for new military governors, and ways the eventual new provinces could be tweaked to his liking. For a moment, he grimaced - the ability to affect such change with a single pen stroke felt like the power of a warlord, not a Kylakas. But he pushed the concern aside - authority was the essence of governance, after all - and the decisions he made today might define governance for quite a while. ''Alright...'' Laskaris picked up a quill. ''Let's focus on...''"
 flavor_ameion.2.a: "''...appointing enlightened governors... can't integrate the Taychendi by ignoring them.''"
 flavor_ameion.2.b: "''...improving their ties with our western neighbors. Ameion doesn't exist in a vacuum.''"
 flavor_ameion.2.c: "''...improving their military capabilities. Military expansion and suppression is a priority.''"
 
 flavor_ameion.3.t: "Will of the Gods"
 flavor_ameion.3.d: "Laskaris was looking out over Amphragma when Jaherios Lykos found him. Even a decade after he'd taken it, the grandeur of the ruins amazed him, a vast expanse of blackened stone buildings. One could easily mistake it for the ruins of the Precursors. But at the close of the Gophiran Empire, it had been systematically sacked - its people killed or enslaved.\n\n''If they could accomplish this,'' Lykos began, ''how can we possibly call them 'barbarians'?''\n''The Taychendi accomplished this...'' Laskaris replied, exactly as Kerodinsis Arpedan had a decade earlier. ''And then the Taychendi tore it all down.'' This answer had never quite sat right with him, though. ''They just need correction, that's all...''\n\nFor ten years, Jaherios had served him faithfully, the greatest nightblade and rogue alive. The elf had even married the Conqueror's daughter. ''Correction...? Is that what you call what the Synkletos want to do?'' But Lykos had views the Kheionai weren't supposed to have - views for which Laskaris tried his hardest to hide his sympathies. ''I've read the reports from the Oúraskheion. Irenthenes wants to abolish temple privileges in the provinces - start seizing their lands!''\n\nLaskaris turned to his son-in-law, his face a mask. ''What do you think Kheionai rule means? Its a key part of establishing control... order. Saving Taychend from itself.''\nLykos scowled. ''You've travelled Taychend as much as I have - you've seen the festivals, the sacrifices, the games... if we start, soon the Taychend you loved will be gone. You won't save it - you'll destroy it. And...'' He lowered his voice to a whisper. ''...what do you think the gods will think of that?''\n\nThe gods who gave you that prophecy. The gods who rendered you immortal. Laskaris turned away as irrational thoughts assaulted him. As years of doubts and inner struggle resurfaced. Finally, he spoke."
 flavor_ameion.3.a: "The gods will think nothing. The gods are not real. Do not talk about this again."
 flavor_ameion.3.b: "I'll send a message to Irenthenes... the temples will be protected."
 
 flavor_ameion.4.t: "Heated Argument"
 flavor_ameion.4.d: "Laskaris rushed in alongside his bodyguards, half dressed - he could barely register what he was seeing at first. A bloodied, battered Jaherios Lykos was being pinned to the ground by Kerodinsis Arpedan, who held a spear to his throat. There was another body on the floor, blood pooling - Filinas the Red, one of his guards. ''What is the meaning of this?!''\n\n''The wolf has gone rabid!'' Kerodinsis barked. The Kylakas had never seen him so angry. ''You should have heard him, Laskaris- talking like some delusional Bharbhen fool! Filinas tried to talk sense into him, and the wolf killed him for it!''\nLykos laughed. ''Sense?! You're an idiot, Arpedan- you look at a Kheionai mud-hut and call it civilized, then look at a Taychendi palace and call it sav-!''\nKerodinsis flipped the spear and rammed the butt into Lykos' stomach. The nightblade sputtered blood. ''Insufferable rogue! You fuck his daughter and think you're invincible-?! You'll see-!''\n\n"Enough!'' Laskaris surged forwards, pushed Kerodinsis away. His old friend looked shocked, half betrayed. ''Is this how we win our legacy?! Squabbling over petty disagreements?!''\n''He's a heretic, Laskaris!'' The old general spat. ''Everyone else is blind, but you and I know! We see the truth!''\n''Ha-!'' Jaherios managed to chuckle through the pain. ''A heretic... Filinas said your subjects were fools... that the Taychendi followed you like sheep to slaughter! He said they're like children... they're stupid... they're savage! Is that what you believe, Laskaris? Is it really?!''\n\nLaskaris looked to the corpse on the floor. Filinas and his damned mouth... but he knew there were a million Ambhen who shared his views. Laskaris shook his head, grimaced. With a word, he could exile Lykos... and potentially secure Ambhen superiority forever. But did he really want the Kheionai to dominate the Taychendi, and leave them in their shadow forever?"
 flavor_ameion.4.a: "''Get out of my sight, Jaherios- I never want to see you again!''"
 flavor_ameion.4.b: "''Filinas got himself killed. Lykos is blameless... so let's just move on...''"
 
 flavor_ameion.5.t: "Fate Fulfilled"
 flavor_ameion.5.d1: "How exactly Laskaris passed is unknown - he kept the destined means of his demise a secret for almost three decades. He was found slumped over a tree stump with a content smile upon his lips, as if content with all he had accomplished with the time afforded to him.\n\nHe is to be buried per his requests: alongside the soldiers who died fulfilling his destiny, almost in eyesight of where his forces first landed in Taychend. For now, his grave is adorned by those in mourning, but in time it will resemble all those around it.\n\nHe leaves behind two legitimate children, Evindalus and Istradora, and one notable bastard son, Kelesades. They are expected to continue to play an active role in Ambhen life, and continue the Conqueror's family line, but not to continue his legacy. As was hastily but soundly confirmed in a ''battlefield election'' soon after Laskaris' death, it will be the solidly Keintagogist political diarchy of Kerodinsis Arpedan, his second-in-command and the new Kylakas, and Irenthenes Gakones, the legal genius and consummate political operator, who will now rule Ameion. The senate and people assembled are behind them - but there are also whispers that nefarious actors, like the exiled nightblade Jaherios Lykos, may try to regain their influence."
 flavor_ameion.5.d2: "How exactly Laskaris passed is unknown; he kept the destined means of his demise a secret for almost three decades. He was found over a tree stump, as though he were kneeling by it.\n\nHe is buried per his requests: in the traditional style of the Taychendi upper caste, in a crypt overlooking the beach where his forces first landed in these lands. The foreign gods, if at all powerful, ultimately took no pity upon Laskaris.\nNo matter; the dusk of their era approaches.\n\nHe leaves behind two legitimate children, Evindalus and Istradora, and one illegitimate son, Kelesades. They are expected to continue the Conqueror's family line, but not to continue his legacy. As was confirmed in a ''battlefield election'' soon after Laskaris' death - hastily organized, as to avoid the interference of the followers of Jaherios Lykos - it will be the political diarchy of Kerodinsis Arpedan, Laskaris' old second-in-command and the new Kylakas, and Irenthenes Gakones, ever the consummate political operator, who will now rule Ameion. Their comparatively conservative, Kheionai-supremacist policies make them popular in Ameion proper, but Lykos has garnered massive support among the millions of Ameion's new Taychendi subjects - time will tell if they will be able to hold the nightblade's influence off forever."
 flavor_ameion.5.d3: "How exactly Laskaris passed is unknown; he kept the destined means of his demise a secret for almost three decades. He was found slouched on a tree stump, as though meditating upon it.\n\nHe is to be buried per his request: a modest arrangement paid for by his descendants and placed not too far from where he first set foot in Taychend. He died a very different man from he who first came to these lands as a conqueror, but his destiny was fulfilled all the same.\n\nHe leaves behind two legitimate children, Evindalus and Istradora, and one illegitimate son, Kelesades. They are expected to continue the Conqueror's family line - but not to continue his legacy. As was confirmed in a ''battlefield election'' soon after Laskaris' death, it will be the political diarchy of Kerodinsis Arpedan, Laskaris' second-in-command and the new Kylakas, and Irenthenes Gakones, ever the consummate political operator, who will now rule Ameion. Time will tell if they will successfully carry the torch. Already some whisper that Jaherios Lykos is making moves of his own - nobody yet knows what form they might take."
 flavor_ameion.5.a: "So passes the Conqueror who put Ameion on the map."
 
 flavor_ameion.6.t:0 "The Wolf's Gambit"
 flavor_ameion.6.d:0 "Jaherios Lýkos, the roguish illusion mage and infiltrator, was one of Laskaris' most loyal supporters, even marrying the Conqueror's daughter Istradora. There were always fears about his beliefs, however - whispered gossip that he worshipped Laskaris as divine, and that he believed his descendants would one day rule a great empire from Nanru Nakar, a synthesis of Taychendi and Kheionai culture. Incredibly - inconceivably, to even his greatest detractors - those fears have been proven true. The Conqueror's son in law is a heretic - and to make matters impossibly worse, a murderer and a traitor. Kerodinsis Arpedan is slain by his hand, and now Lýkos has moved to overthrow the republic!\n\nThe capital has been thrown into chaos, as Taychendi auxiliaries and Lýkos' die-hard Kheionai loyalists, smuggled into Ameion as servants and dock-hands, fight to seize the Oúraskheion and the gates of the city. To make matters worse, Lýkos has joined forces with Shacytia Arachne, the bodyguard and long-time mistress of Laskaris, to place the Conqueror's bastard son Kelesades on the throne of Ameion - not as Kylakas, but as King! All know the power would truly lie with Lýkos, however. Should he succeed, it is likely that the true power base of the empire will move to Taychend - where already the Hero-Cult of Laskaris has thrown its support behind Lýkos' effort - and the capital to Nagar Vyechei, whose own assembly, the Valhathikutta, sees the opportunity to reassert Taychendi influence. With much of the army on campaign, only veterans, raw recruits and dusty old senators are available to hold the capital - though should we fight with everything we have, that may well be enough. Regardless, even if we stop him in Ameion, it is likely Lýkos and Shachytia will flee back to Taychend and attempt to gather an army. The fate of both Taychend and Ameion are on the line!"
 flavor_ameion.6.a:0 "Lýkos is stopped and flees the capital!"
 flavor_ameion.6.b:0 "Lýkos' gambit succeeds - the Kheionai rise in revolt!"

 
 flavor_ameion.8.t: "[From.GetCapitalName] Falls"
 flavor_ameion.8.d: "Laskaris slumped to the floor, calling for a wineskin as he breathed hard. The Kylakas was covered in blood - and, as always, only a small amount was his own. He thanked his companion as he took the skin and drank deeply. Then, as he gave the skin back, he surveyed the carnage around him... and his soldiers marching through the dead and dying, restoring order in the ruins of [From.GetCapitalName].\n\nLaskaris always fought at the front when taking cities. The tip of the spear, unbroken and unbowed. As his victories mounted, so did his confidence - but no matter how many thousands fled before his advance, or died before his spear, he knew that confidence could not lead to complacency.\n\nThe Kylakas ran over the siege in his mind, remembered every decision, every tactic. Eventually, he decided they..."
 flavor_ameion.8.a: "...were effective."
 flavor_ameion.8.b: "...could use improvement."
 
 flavor_ameion.9.t: "The Toll of Conquest"
 flavor_ameion.9.d: "The Conqueror took his helmet off, let the blood frame his eyes like war-paint. Before him, thousands of Taychendi lay dead, broken - hundreds by his hand. Behind him, Kheionai bodies were being carried off for burial. He recognised faces he had seen amongst his troops for years - remembered some of their names, too. Lowborn peasants and slum-rats, as he had once been, who had followed him to glory... and then to death.\n\nThe world favoured him. His entire life Laskaris had never known true defeat. He had swept every foe and obstacle aside like nothing. If he were Taychendi, his epithet would be ''Worldshaper.'' But Laskaris was still mortal, still imbued with the flaws of elvenkind. He looked to one of his bodyguards, Shachytia, the mother of his bastard son. Women - and some men too, over the years - seemed to fall before him just as his enemies did. He had failed his wife as much as he had his soldiers, those who had met their own fate in a foreign land because of his own designs, his own ambition, his own destiny.\n\nBut when he laid in bed with a woman not his wife, he could only think, ''what can I do?'' He was flesh and blood, he hungered, he lusted. He had only so long to live. When he thought of his soldiers, who fought and died for a cause so close to his own and yet so distant, he could only think ''what can I do?'' When his time came, and he faced either ascension or oblivion, his destiny would become memory. There was nothing he could do about it - and maybe that was for the best."
 flavor_ameion.9.a: "For the first and only time in Laskaris' life, he couldn't wait for it to be over."
 
 #Mission Events
 flavor_ameion.11.t: "Leaders' Meeting"
 flavor_ameion.11.d1: "After a comfortable journey through the Mteibas Valley, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] met with [G63.Monarch.GetTitle] [G63.Monarch.GetName] in the latter's seat of power in [G63.Capital.GetName]. The Kylakas listened intently as their Bharbhen counterpart told them of their traditions of independence, of how they shaped the very ground itself to defend their liberty, how they strove to defend the ideals of their ancestral leader, whom they called Munazhlan, and the Kheionai call Munakles.\n\nAs the conversation progressed - and, thanks to an extremely intelligent interpreter, it was indeed a conversation, with [G63.Monarch.GetTitle] [G63.Monarch.GetName] talking at length on matters of history and culture and freedom - it became clear that the Mteibhar were not only proud of their Bharbhen ways, but willing to defend them with everything they had. No doubt, a military solution will be difficult.\n\nIf the only way for the Mteibhar to accept Ambhen rule is to treat them as equals, and give them significant concessions until such a time as they voluntarily accept Kheionai civilisation, then that may be the best course of action - but it must be remembered that the Taychendi too once seemed undefeatable in battle. Perhaps these Bharbhen can be cowed like any others?"
 flavor_ameion.11.d2: "After a comfortable journey through the Mteibas Valley, Laskaris had met with [G63.Monarch.GetTitle] [G63.Monarch.GetName] in the latter's seat of power in [G63.Capital.GetName]. He had listened intently as their Bharbhen counterpart told them of their traditions of independence, of how they shaped the very ground itself to defend their liberty, how they strove to defend the ideals of their ancestral leader, whom they called Munazhlan and the Kheionai call Munakles.\n\nLaskaris had been captivated - as he spoke at length with [G63.Monarch.GetTitle] [G63.Monarch.GetName] on matters of all kinds, he could see so many points on which the Mteibhar and Kheionai were fundamentally aligned. While to the Kheionai, liberty had been ''legalised,'' confined to the realm of institutions and property and legal rights, to the Mteibhar it seemed so much... more real. It poured through their lives, their ideologies.\n\nCould Laskaris really take that away from them? When he had turned his back on his father's kin, the Basobhar, he did so in the belief that the Kheionai way of life - urbanised, ordered - had superior qualities to that of the Bharbhen. It was simply better, safer, richer. But over the years, he had learnt that elves cared for far more than basic needs of wealth and security. He could bring the Mteibhar Kheionai civilisation by the sword, as he had in Taychend - but he couldn't help but feel both the Mteibhar and Ameion would be poorer for it."

 flavor_ameion.13.d: "The nékhei closest to us, Deyeion, is ruled by [G56.Overlord.GetName] despite its considerable distance from Alecand proper. [G62.GetName] found liberty after its founder fell in wars with its neighbors, but now we must move the wheel forward to see self rule in the Andic Reach fulfilled."
 flavor_ameion.13.a: "To arms!"
 
 flavor_ameion.14.t: "Échate League Agrees to Borders"
 flavor_ameion.14.d: "As Kheionai settlers push into the interior of the Devand, they compete not only with the Basobhar for land, but each other. Today, the three members of the Échate League: [G62.GetName], [G56.GetName], and of course [G52.GetName] gather to set aside their differences so that they can focus on the growth of their states. The focus on natural borders ensures there will be little room for future conflicts, and signatures between the three [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] seals the fate of the Andic Reach."
 flavor_ameion.14.a: "For the growth of the League!"
 
 flavor_ameion.15.t: "Civilization of Exiles"
 flavor_ameion.15.d: "It was an ingenious plan, one that only learned philosophers and scholars of government could devise - if there were always to be those who would reject our rule, and reject the value of Kheionai civilisation, why should we suffer their incessant whining and rebellious schemes? As in the realm of law, exile is more moral than death - and so that shall be our solution.\n\nAlready, the first Taychendi ''settlers'' have arrived on the island, devoid of any form of civilization. Not even primal tribes wander across the trees and cliffs on this landmass. Here they will build a place for their values, however backward, to survive - already, they have established a government they believe mimics the last issued law-code of Vul Tenvach. So long as this reserve exists, those who foolishly challenge our rule on the mainland will have no allies to muster, and will ultimately submit, or come here."
 flavor_ameion.15.a: "A containment zone for their barbarity!"
 
 flavor_ameion.16.t: "Taychendi Request Land"
 flavor_ameion.16.d: "Following the Ameioni conquests of Taychend, some within the nation have sought refuge in [2324.GetName], where they seek to establish a place for those against Ameioni rule to live. However, this outpost has been supported by Ameion itself, and will at least nominally be loyal to it."
 flavor_ameion.16.a: "Allow them to purchase the land."
 flavor_ameion.16.b: "Deny their request of autonomy."
 
 flavor_ameion.23.t: "The Delegations Arrive"
 flavor_ameion.23.d: "The Chendhyans, with their swift feline mounts and proximity to Ameion, are the first to arrive for the Summit. Their mounts seem timid in an urban environment unfamiliar to these steppe-native animals. The tribal leaders are reminiscent of their mounts, tame but eyeing those unfamiliar to them with suspicion.\n\nOur fellow kheionai arrive next; the [G56.GetAdjective] and [G62.GetAdjective] of our League are the most familiar with Ameion proper, a city much like their own but showing its magnificence and influence in the streets alone.\n\nThe Mteibhar come also by boat, but in smaller river vessels following the river from their lands to ours. They are the most familiar with the style of gathering this Summit invokes, with their own tribes partaking in a smaller scale activity within their valley.\n\nThe most distant of our subjects, the Taychendi, arrive last. Hundreds of ships enter Ameion's harbour from the great ports of the east, as our subjects make a point of showing off the power they have retained through our conquests - though the city they enter is no longer a peripheral trading outpost on the edge of their world, but the master of that world's future."
 flavor_ameion.23.a: "The Summit begins..."
 
 flavor_ameion.24.t: "The Chendhyan Delegations"
 flavor_ameion.24.d: "Though the Chendhyans, bearing gifts of tobacco and gold jewellery, have come wearing Kheionai clothing out of respect for our sensibilities, they still proudly display atop their tunics their characteristic jaguar pelts - a reminder that though they may acknowledge our authority, they will not bow down to it. Indeed, just as they are swift and fierce in battle, they are quickest to bring their concerns to the table, and their determined efforts have dominated the Summit's first days.\n\nMore than anything, they value their freedom, and even now would rather fight to the last than become second-class citizens under our rule. Above all, they wish for their ancient rights and privileges to be respected, and for Ambhen settlement on the steppe to be kept to a minimum. Though some accept their concerns, and wish to protect their lands from further colonisation, others are doubtful - maybe simply cutting their tax burden would allow them to prosper in a new, Kheionised world?"
 flavor_ameion.24.a: "We shall reserve their lands for their tribes to prosper."
 flavor_ameion.24.b: "We shall ease their taxes."
 
 flavor_ameion.25.t: "The Kheionai Delegations"
 flavor_ameion.25.d: "The representatives of [G56.GetAdjective] and [G62.GetAdjective] are scarcely distinguishable from our own, much to the confusion of the Devandi and Taychendi. To resolve this issue we have color coded our outfits with cloth produced by each of our cities. Likewise, we bestow such cloths to the other delegates, along with preserved foods suitable for voyages or winter storage.\n\nWhile our friends in the Échate League have the fewest complaints, they have taken this opportunity to call attention to the waterways through the 'Sea of Ameion' connecting the Devand to Taychend. We have made many developments in our new lands, but according to the two cities we should give the waters such attention."
 flavor_ameion.25.a: "We shall build new ships to strengthen trade ties."
 flavor_ameion.25.b: "We shall build new ports to facilitate trade."
 
 flavor_ameion.26.t: "The Mteibhar Delegation"
 flavor_ameion.26.d: "The humble Mteibhar have learned much from us - rather than purchasing Kheionai clothing like the Chendhyans, they have made an effort to weave their own woolen clothes in imitation of Kheionai style - richly decorated and quite beautiful, though many Eilastes have noted that they are still marked by their Bharbhen character. As a gesture of goodwill they bring incense and small stone statues.\n\nThe Mteibhar have been attempting to centralise their own confederal society along Kheionai lines for many years now, but a lack of support from Ameion and the dogged resistance of the tribes themselves have hindered their efforts. Thus the Mteibhar delegates have pleaded for more support, in particular noting the lack of a judicial framework and centralised military force with which to enforce the control of the central government."
 flavor_ameion.26.a: "We shall help them codify common laws."
 flavor_ameion.26.b: "We shall teach them to demonstrate their might."
 
 flavor_ameion.27.t: "The Taychendi Delegation"
 flavor_ameion.27.d: "The delegations of the Taychendi were among the largest and most extravagant of all sent. Clearly, our Thekvrystana and Yodhanpir subjects - alongside a notable number of Klereyen -  have used the Summit to show off the might and power they have retained through our conquest,  bringing along with them masses of servants and guards, flanking gifts of spices, teas, fine silks and cloth.\n\nNegotiations and meetings with the Taychendi have taken up a large part of the Summit, as the various disparate interest groups jockey for Synkletos support - perhaps the biggest issue, however, lies in the the question of resource allocation, particularly in efforts to support economic development. While those in the cities simply request more funding, confident that they can pursue their own projects, those in the countryside have been asking for more Ambhen personnel in order to enforce their designs on their ever-restless kin."
 flavor_ameion.27.a: "We shall send additional personnel to oversee development."
 flavor_ameion.27.b: "We shall send additional funding for such efforts."
 
 flavor_ameion.28.t: "The Summit Concludes"
 flavor_ameion.28.d: "After two months of fraternizing, the representatives return to their homelands, laden with goods from their counterparts. The city's alcohol reserves may be empty, but groups that once considered each other alien and hostile will remember these days of diplomacy and nights of revelry. Some are even eager to learn our language to foster communication between their newfound friends.\n\nThe time now turns to work, however. Promises were made to our subjects, and fulfilling them will necessitate keeping the goblets empty."
 flavor_ameion.28.a: "From strangers to family."
 
 flavor_ameion.29.t: "The Effelai Delegation"
 flavor_ameion.29.d: "In the Dry Coast to the east, the Exemplars upon landing found the scattered remnants of a group called the Oono'i. Their descendants, who now only share partial ancestry, have explained to a curious reception how their forefathers set their homeland alight to fight against the jungle's influence. The Dugui'hi, who now travel Taychend as traders and mercenaries, have retold once more the story of their exile from the Mushroom Forest. These speakers have almost always been joined by ambitious Eilastes known for their support of northern expansion. The message is clear: we must take the fight to the jungle before it takes the fight to us.\n\nBut there is an alternate opinion. A few locals, mostly travelling from Cannorian ports along the coast, have told of the benevolence of the jungle - they say that it is not the mindless nightmare that the Oono'i and Dugui'hi frame it as. In fact, they say that a state such as ours may be able to come to an arrangement with it. Perhaps it is worth investigating this possibility?"
 flavor_ameion.29.a: "Perhaps these locals can be trusted?"
 flavor_ameion.29.b: "We must push into it ourselves!"
 
 flavor_ameion.30.t: "The Amadian Delegation"
 flavor_ameion.30.d: "The Amadians live in a land of chaos and wild magic - but, as many senators and notables have been espousing over the last few weeks, while parading around the victims of Cannorian colonisation, ''while their conditions are poor, even they do not deserve to be despoiled and exploited by these barbaric invaders from across the sea!''\n\nNo doubt the Amadians themselves are saying the same thing - though the keynote addresses have often been dominated by their benefactors. While many are sympathetic to the Amadians' plight, with the foreign, up-jumped bharbhen Cannorians much maligned, the plight of Amadians has become a sticking point between supporters of the military (who advocate sending military aid to the Amadians) and supporters of economic revitalisation (who advocate giving the Amadians economic support in return for limited kheionisation). It may be down to us to decide which faction wins."
 flavor_ameion.30.a: "To defeat the Cannorians, they must first become more like us!"
 flavor_ameion.30.b: "All the Amadians need is some guns, some plate, and some grit!"
 
 flavor_ameion.31.t: "The Cannorian Delegation"
 flavor_ameion.31.d: "Throughout the Summit, the Cannorians have found themselves the subject of much gossip and slander, as each party looks on them with suspicion - they are, after all, no doubt a perfidious and dangerous foe, who believe themselves more ''civilised'' than they actually are. But still, they have been invited as guests, in order to see the might and majesty of the Ambhen Empire - and to understand that we are in every way their equal.\n\nThat seems to have been accomplished - but the actual meat of discussions and negotiation with them is more contentious. The Cannorians seem to want assurances and guarantees of free trade, primarily to satiate their hunger for Precursor relics. In return, they are promising gifts of new technologies - but it may well be a poisoned chalice, and their presence in our land will surely undermine our economic position. Ultimately, we must decide if we want to continue to entertain their overtures, or reject them outright in a testament to our independence."
 flavor_ameion.31.a: "The Cannorians can go back to their own continent!"
 flavor_ameion.31.b: "Sometimes progress must come before pride..."
 
 flavor_ameion.33.t: "Finishing Laskaris' Ambition"
 flavor_ameion.33.d: "As we reorganize our forces to complete our unification of Taychend, a familiar name has risen through the ranks. Kelindas Laskaris, a descendant of Laskaris the Conqueror, has emerged as a formidable commander of the Ameioni forces, and professes his eagerness to complete what his ancestor has started in these lands.\n\nThe house of the Conqueror has been a constant if sidelined presence in Ambhen politics since Laskaris' death, as Móloíst fears over another potential monarchist revolt have stymied their ambitions - nonetheless, Kelindas' skills are comparable to his forebear, so perhaps he may prove himself to be a Conqueror yet."
 flavor_ameion.33.a: "Onwards, to Nákyra!"
 
 flavor_ameion.34.t: "The Nékheis of Devand"
 flavor_ameion.34.d: "We have driven the Alecandi from the mainland, and now the era of self-rule in Devand has arrived. While the nékheis may have aspirations of total independence, they fully acknowledge that rule under us shall be more beneficial to them than any other realistic alternative.\n\nUnder our wing, they shall flourish as more than the second-class kheions they have hitherto been treated as."
 flavor_ameion.34.a: "They shall know peace and self governance."
 flavor_ameion.34.b: "Consolidate western Devand into a united polity."
 flavor_ameion.34.c: "This is unnecessary."
 
 flavor_ameion.35.t: "Cleaved Sea Admirality"
 flavor_ameion.35.d: "[G59.GetName] has always held a unique position among the nékheis, as it was founded entirely in the islands within the Cleaved Sea. This gave its citizens an unparalleled maritime tradition in the kheionai world. Some have considered giving them a unique position within our domain.\n\nTheir expertise could help us ensure dominance in the Cleaved Sea, but the nékheis have vocalized a desire to rule the islands for themselves."
 flavor_ameion.35.a: "Grant [G59.GetName] the position of Cleaved Sea Admirality"

 flavor_ameion.36.t: "[From.GetName] Demands Fealty"
 flavor_ameion.36.d: "[From.GetName] has conquered many lands to the east, and now it sets its eyes to the west. It has declared an ultimatum to the kheions to submit and allow for unity to cross the kheionai peoples.\n\nFew are fond of this idea, but it is questionable if we have the strength to resist their rule."
 flavor_ameion.36.a: "Kneel, there is little shame in being ruled by our kin."

 flavor_ameion.37.d: "We have received word from [From.GetName] that they have accepted our demands of fealty. We are one step closer to uniting the kheionai, and this step was taken without bloodshed."
 flavor_ameion.37.a: "We are glad they were sensible."
 
 flavor_ameion.38.t: "[From.GetName] Rejects Fealty"
 flavor_ameion.38.d: "We have received word from [From.GetName] that they have rejected our demands of fealty. We cannot back down from our ultimatum, so it is merely a question if we are to subjugate their existing government, or conquer their land and reorganize it later."
 flavor_ameion.38.a: "We will make them kneel."
 flavor_ameion.38.b: "We will topple them, then raise them to their knees."
 
 flavor_ameion.39.t: "The Kheions Bend the Knee"
 flavor_ameion.39.d: "Since the days of Laskaris our realm has been at the forefront of the Kheionai world, the fruits of Taychend, both material and philosophical, sent back to the Kheions that once birthed our civilization - but the homeland itself has been divided, weak, as the individual cities bicker amongst themselves. It was only right that we stepped in - and now, finally, our efforts to restore order to our ancient homeland have borne fruit. Even the western bharben have bent the knee to [Root.GetName]'s might!\n\nNow, we must decide what to do with them. There have been sparse calls for direct annexation, but the costs of ruling such storied, ancient cities are high indeed. Instead, many call for the retention of the Kheions' ancient autonomy, traditions and privileges, either under a united federal League, as once briefly existed under Ormam or Kimanis, or under individual agreements that bind each Kheion to our state. Bills to each effect have been proposed in the Synkletos - all we must do is ensure one of them goes through."
 flavor_ameion.39.a: "They shall know peace and self governance."

 flavor_ameion.39.c: "Integrate them directly into our state."
 
 flavor_ameion.40.t: "Leader of the Kheionai World"
 flavor_ameion.40.d: "After four hours of self-congratulatory speeches, the Kylakas finally stood. They had much to celebrate, of course - but the Eilastes had a tendency to go on and on. ''Elves of [Root.GetName]!'' [Root.Monarch.GetName] began, as the Synkletos settled. ''We have come far indeed! It was only a millennium ago that our ancestors were fleeing west from the father-cities, that our founder - a Prince, not a Kylakas - began the long process of granting both liberty AND security to our new home, at the edge of the world! For centuries, we enriched ourselves, through hardship and invasion. We built on what we were given - and thrived.''\n\n''And, for a time, we were content... but Laskaris the Conqueror shook us awake from our complacency! Made us aware that the greatness of our civilisation could be brought to those beyond our borders- to all those who lived in the savage, oppressive, empty desolation of Bharbhen life!'' The Kylakas gestured to one of the Kleyeren senators in the chamber, ''...and so we did - and Taychendi and Basobhar and Chendhyan alike were lifted from their destitution. But we were missing something still! It was not only the Bharbhen that cried out for order, for aid - our own homeland needed our guidance! And we, my fellow Eilastes, have marched west and delivered it!''\n\nThe senators cheered as the Kylakas continued. ''And now, we must decide what to do with our new status - our new role, as the spear and shield of the most learned civilization, the most dutiful civilization, the most sophisticated civilization - as the leaders of the Kheionai world! For these decisions are now in our hands, and our hands alone, and what we say today may affect the greatness and glory of history itself for the rest of time! And for that reason, it is my belief that we must...''"
 flavor_ameion.40.a: "''...allow the ancient wisdom of the Kheions to guide us into the future!''"
 flavor_ameion.40.b: "''...allow our kin to be shining examples of Ambhen stewardship!''"
 flavor_ameion.40.c: "''...allow our firm rule to show the benefits of Ambhen hegemony!''"
 
 flavor_ameion.41.t: "Pacifying Orenkoraim"
 flavor_ameion.41.d: "Since we came to terms with the Cannorians, Orenkoraim have flourished from their ill-gotten gains, serving as the hub and heart of Cannorian influence in Taychend and getting rich and populous in the process. Cannorian and Taychendi mercenaries alike stream from the dockyards of the Untaken Island, the imposing Gathyanavaida welcoming thousands of so-called ''adventurers'' - really ''plunderers'' - every year.\n\nBut it is time to put a stop to that. This is our continent, this is our region, and Orenkoraim is our city. Ameion bows to no state, and we will not bow to the Cannorians. Unfortunately, it seems that the Cannorians, in conjunction with the decadent Taychendi nobles of Orenkoraim, are not willing to back down.\n\nThe lord of Orenkoraim has called in every favour and connection he has, armed every citizen, bought every mercenary company on his books - and most worryingly, they have also called in their protectors, their puppetmasters. Soon, the Cannorian powers will be sailing down to Taychend with their fleets and ships, braving the waters of South Aelantir - and the dent to their military budgets - to secure this last bastion of their influence.\n\nNo doubt, they think it will be an easy victory - and so it is time to show them just how wrong they are!"
 flavor_ameion.41.a: "They may be vultures, but we are no corpse!"
 
 flavor_ameion.48.t: "An Empire Born of Ruin"
 flavor_ameion.48.d: "Aelantir is a land known for its chaos. Its modern history is defined by its apocalyptic destruction over a thousand years ago. For most of the period since then, the lands we now encompass never settled away from this chaos: raiders and warlords dominated Taychend, the kheions were bombarded by the Kaydhano, and even the city of Ameion was once humble, a riverside patch of dirt settled by the losing faction of a war.\n\nIn more recent times, we took it upon ourselves to end this chaos, to restore the peace our ancestors maintained for millenia. Those who found comfort in the disorder resisted us, afraid of the bright future we had in mind, but just as eyes adjust to daylight after time indoors, they found themselves living lives of comfort their grand-parents could not comprehend.\n\nEven still, we are but one corner of Aelantir. The chaos has not been vanquished in the Effelai to our north, the Kaydhano still rages, and many of the Elves reborn in the Ruin find themselves subjugated by powers who have no right to these lands. Our victory stands regardless, for we have made ourselves the bedrock of Aelantir, the foundation from which the Ruinborn shall rebuild the legacy our ancestors destroyed."
 flavor_ameion.48.a: "Laskaris drew out the sword, and now we sheathe it."

 flavor_ameion.50.t: "Thirendires Holds Rally"
 flavor_ameion.50.d: "The noble family of Laskaris has been influential in Ameion since the death of the Conqueror himself, and over the years many of its members have served Ameion with distinction - but it has been centuries since his death. In that time, some of his descendants have taken Taychendi spouses or mistresses - clearly, that is how Thirendires Laskaris, a Klereyen, came to be.\n\nOf obscure background, he was accepted by the wider Laskaris' family - and Ameioni society as a whole - after demonstrating his valour in battle, despite his status as a bastard. Now an influential commander known to have a similar temperament to his ancestor, he has taken to holding military parades in the recently conquered Nákyra. While such events are not unheard of, some have raised the concern that Thirendires may be promoting his own leadership over that of Ameion's. We could put a stop to the gatherings, but the local forces would not take kindly to it."
 flavor_ameion.50.a: "Our armies deserve this victory."
 flavor_ameion.50.b: "Suppress this propaganda."
 
 flavor_ameion.51.t: "Thirendires in Politics"
 flavor_ameion.51.d: "After Thirendires left the military, making the move to a successful career in politics was simple for him. Quickly becoming the governor of Nákyra, Thirendires has overseen the transformation of the city from a war-torn heap into a kheion surpassing any other, claiming to fulfil the dreams of his celebrated ancestor. This has continued to bolster his standing with the residents of the city and surrounding countryside.\n\nThirendires, however, has not just been focused on economic growth, but also political reform. The elite of Ameion, the ''pureblooded'' Ambhen, enjoy wide privileges and tax exemptions across the various provinces of the Empire, granting Ambhen settlers a leg up on their Klereyen countrymen. Laskaris' most recent proposal aims to eliminate these exemptions and standardize taxation across the province.\n\nDespite persistent legal challenges, the move is undeniably within his rights as governor - but many are saying that this may upset the delicate power balance that has kept Ameion's empire together, and strengthen Thirendires' hand should he wish to further his own position."
 flavor_ameion.51.a: "They are citizens like any other - let it pass."
 flavor_ameion.51.b: "Veto the bill - harmony does not always mean equality."
 
 flavor_ameion.52.t: "Nákyra Supports Thirendires"
 flavor_ameion.52.d: "As his influence grows, Thirendires has begun to intensify his rhetoric, casting himself as the protector of the Klereyen within Ameion. Klereyen across Taychend, long having lived in the shadow of an Ambhen elite suspicious of their power, are beginning to support Thirendires' faction - and Nákyra, now a major hub within Ameion, has become the core of his support.\n\nCandidates supporting Thirendires' platform have sprung up across Ameion's Taychendi provinces, as pamphlets espousing the Laskarian scion's political platform circulate across the empire - some of these pamphlets even call for Thirendires to proclaim leadership not only over Nákyra, but the nation as a whole.\n\nConcern over Thirendires' power has reached a fever pitch, as many are beginning to say that his focus on Nákyra is eerily reminiscent of the superstitious prophecy that once drove Jaherios Lykos, the mad nightblade and companion of Laskaris, to attempt to overthrow the republic. Politicians in [2620.GetName] have called for him to be arrested to prevent further unrest, but some, believing the swirling rumours of a power grab to be nothing but bluster - and understanding that many of the Klereyen's grievances are valid - worry such a measure may only provoke a stronger, perhaps even violent response."
 flavor_ameion.52.a: "Why should we care that the Klereyen have learnt how to do politics?"
 flavor_ameion.52.b: "This has gone on long enough - arrest him!"
  
 flavor_ameion.53.t: "Rebels Free Thirendires"
 flavor_ameion.53.d: "Mere weeks after Thirendires was imprisoned for suspicion of treason against the Republic of Ameion, his supporters have laid siege to the prisons and allowed him to walk out of its walls!\n\nTo many in the Synkletos, some of the more lurid rumours surrounding Thirendires have been proven true - utilising the power they have built up in local government over the years, Laskaris' supporters have now taken up armed resistance to our rule, demanding Thirendires be instated as our ruler!"
 flavor_ameion.53.a: "We stand at the edge of conflict."
 
 flavor_ameion.54.t: "Thirendires Proclaims Emperorship"
 flavor_ameion.54.d: "For years, the rise of Thirendires Laskaris has consumed Ameion's political life, as many have watched his growing power with frightful concern, and just as many with hopeful enthusiasm. Thirendires' ambitions have cleaved right through numerous fractures in Ambhen politics - Keintagogísts and Móloísts, Klereyen and Ambhen, east and west - and at last, it has cleaved through the Republic itself.\n\nFrom his seat in Nákyra, Thirendires has proclaimed himself Emperor, and his supporters have seized provinces across Ameion's Taychendi territories. To his Kleyeren supporters, he is the successor to the great Taychendi Emperors of ages past; to his Ambhen supporters, he is the successor to Prince Syrenthos and Laskaris the Conqueror, and Ameion's mythical past. To his detractors, he is the successor to the tyrant and warlord they had once thought vanquished.\n\nIt matters little what people think anymore, of course. Now, all that matters is armies and generals and bloodshed. The Emperor Thirendires vows to reforge Ameion into an empire never before seen by the Kheionai, and the Synkletos vows to crush him - war awaits, and there is no doubt it will be a bloody one indeed."

 flavor_ameion.58.d: "Over a millennium ago, the Kheions overthrew their monarchs after the First League War showed such figureheads to be incompetent.

 flavor_ameion.59.d: "After the failure of the Wolf's Gambit that followed Laskaris' death, rumours that the Conqueror was a secret heretic persisted, spread by the Cult of Laskaris - but as Ameion's efforts at Kheionisation succeeded, they fell by the wayside along with most Taychendi superstition. However, the rise of Thirendires has lead to new rumours arising that this new conqueror may have inherited more than Laskaris' political mantle.\n\nRecently discovered documents seem to prove Laskaris had doubts about the existence of the Taychendi gods, and that he saw in Nanru Nakar more than simple mortal ambition, but divine destiny. Though these documents are questionable in provenance, they could be easily seized upon to claim divine legitimacy for the new emperor's rule. For the masses of Taychendi peasants who still privately cling to superstition, that may be very worthwhile indeed, even as it would inflame his Kheionised supporters. A proclamation on Thirendires' part would earn him the fealty of Taychend, but sow chaos within much of the Kleryen. He has returned to the city briefly from the frontlines to settle the matter, and as his city waits with in-drawn breath, he proclaims..."

But it is also a poisoned land, with the insidious chaos of wild magic having long seeped into the land itself. The Amadians are blessed with innate magical power - but that power is torn to and fro by wild magic's surging storm. Centuries ago, a Kheionai expedition from Oktikheion explored Amadia, and encountered a primitive federation of cities - but they were torn apart by the ambitions of mages empowered by the land itself.\n\nSince we have begun to expand our influence into the region, pushing out the Cannorians who thought to encroach on the ancestral land of the elves, a contentious debate has broken out among the Eilastes. On one hand, some argue that the Amadians should be given some autonomy, allowed to preside over their adoption of Kheionai civilisation and continue it at their own pace - they have not, after all, displayed the same warlike inclinations of peoples like the Taychendi.\n\nBut there is always a chance that they could... 'regress.' Fall back to the same impulses that once destroyed the Onisqado Federation. Were that to happen, our efforts may be set back considerably - and the steady supply of silver and damestear shipped down from Amadia's southern coast would be cut off. A body blow to our economy, to be sure. Is it truly worth it to indulge in sentimentality, when the problems of reality - and the potential damage to Ameion's wealth - could be so dire?"

A philosopher debates another, stuns his foe with arguments drawn from a millennium of strife and conflict, the wisdom of those who once stumbled. A landowner dines with a settler's family - noting the way they look askance at his blonde hair, despite the fact that his skin is only a shade of blue away from theirs.\n\nSince Laskaris led his soldiers into Taychend, Ambhen rule has relied on Taychendi collaborators. People who, even if they did not believe in Kheionisation, acquiesced to Ameion's rule, upheld their laws - then, as time went on, and they began to value security over cultural liberty, began to place their faith not in the gods, but in the elven mind, in reason. These collaborators began to wear Kheionai clothing, speak the Kheionai language, adopt Kheionai philosophy - and marry Kheionai women, granting their children the ruin-marked teal skin of their subjugators.\n\nThe latter isn't a requirement for joining the Kleyeren yet - though there are those in the Synkletos who would like it to be. There are many Ambhen - settlers and officials, generals and administrators - who view this new Kheionised class with suspicion, question if they truly hold Ameion's ideals in their hearts, if they truly can become Kheionai. The Kleyeren, however, already know the answer. They already give their all on the battlefield as Fotistrepei, fill Ameion's coffers and granaries as landowners and merchants, vote in local elections as citizens of their Epadía.

So too had the rest of Andeios, the rest of South Aelantir been revitalised, brought under the light of the only true civilisation in the world.\n\nBut this was not simply ascension - this was reclamation. And there was one height of the past that had not yet been reached. They still couldn't, of course - not for any significant time - but the wonders of magic enabled more miracles by the day. The Kylakas stepped out onto the tower, looked out at the vast expanse of the steppe before [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] - then [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] gave the signal.\n\nThere was a blinding flash of light, as the sound and power of a spell nearly beyond comprehension erupted.

 flavor_ameion.83.d: "The Cult of Neravali is as sprawling as it is ancient, a massive Taychend-wide rogue's guild whose members dedicate themselves to breaking the law in the service of the primordial god of shadows, Neravali - or, if you happen to be a Kheionai member, in service to the Cult-in-Shadow itself. The Cult is divided into five Sects-in-Shadow, with each Sect dedicated to a different roguish discipline.\n\nThe Na'Cailana are the foremost assassins in Andeios, the Na'Sharan the bravest thieves, the Na'Vaidana the most dedicated smugglers, and the Na'Sendali the most well-connected notables, nobles and warlords. But there is one Sect that stands above the chaotic machinations of the others - the Na'Casul. Masters of information gathering, the Na'Casul act as an invaluable information broker to anyone willing to pay the correct price, and they use this to keep the other Sects in line - and protect them from retaliation.\n\nDuring his travels in Taychend, Laskaris himself apparently fell afoul of the Na'Cailana - and in being saved by the Na'Casul, who even before his ascendancy saw his boundless potential, received a ''black favor'', to be called in at a later date. With our forces having seized Nagar Vyechei, rumored to be home to the Na'Casul's central sanctuary, they are now calling that favor in, promising to give Ameion privileged access in exchange for a promise not to attempt to uproot the Cult.\n\nMany are saying that we should reject this insulting offer outright, but to do so would mean we would forgo the considerable resources of the Cult-in-Shadow. The Sects are more malleable than they may seem, as evidenced by their ability to thrive even amongst the Kheionai - would it not be wiser to accept their offer, and extend our influence even to the shadowy underbelly of Taychend?"

The largest surviving city of the Precursors, its smooth-stone towers have become choked not by green vines, but by slum-housing and Taychendi temples, built up and inside and around them. The city has had nearly a million living within its walls for a millennium, and it shows. In Nanru Nakar, the immortal order of the Precursors and the ramshackle chaos of the Taychendi blend together.\n\nBut the city of Nákyra - renewed, rejuvenated, reclaimed - will embody the spirit of elvenkind itself. Kheionised in structure and soul, the wood and salvage-steel slums will be replaced with rows of whitewashed tenements, the stone temples with marble philosophical schools and tombs of great statesmen, the old structures cleared, restored to their former beauty. In Nákyra, the spirit and soul of Ameion, our legacy and our guiding philosophy, will shine beacon-like over our empire, as its beating heart, as the great eastern Kheion - and our new capital.\n\nKelindas Laskaris has retired to the city, dedicating himself to shepherding the process of fulfilling his ancestor's legacy. In the meantime, there is much to be done. The city that Laskaris once looked upon will soon be no more - and in its place, his vision of what it could be will be fulfilled."

 flavor_ameion.85.d: "With their influence concentrated in the city of Orenkoraim, Cannorian traders have been shipping resources of all kinds out of the Kalavend, most notably Precursor relics, for which they pay a premium. Both Cannorian and Kalavendhi have been enriched by this, but those relics will undoubtedly be used for the destabilizing innovations of artificery, not to mention the simple fact that Cannorian encroachment in Taychend will doubtlessly undermine our rule - our efforts so far have failed to turn the trade to our advantage, so sooner or later we must crack down on it.\n\nBut there are... problems. The Cannorian powers enjoy an unparalleled naval advantage. We may be able to beat one alone, but were all of them to come down on us, our navy may well be scattered against the Taychendi coast. Then there is the issue with smugglers - were we to try and crack down on the Kalavendhi trade, it would only invite further Cannorian encroachment elsewhere. The birds would fly their nest.\n\nAnd so, loathe as we are to admit it, there seems to be only one choice - containment. The Cannorians seem receptive to a deal in which we will allow them to operate out of Orenkoraim - the last free port of Taychend - and in so doing avoid our taxes and tariffs. It will ruin our trade position in the Kalavend, but it should keep the Cannorians isolated there for now.\n\nFor now... until we are ready to strike. Then, they shall find out just who is the true master of Aelantir."

 flavor_ameion.86.d: "The senators accused the defendant of breaking truces, making war on Ameion, supporting insurgency, dishonor in war, employing disproportionate force, a dozen massacres and crimes-of-battle. But the defendant gave his responses calmly, passionately. Even in humiliating defeat, bloody and bruised, Ecaris Ecarizuir refused to bow to indignity. To be fair, a trial before the assembled Synkletos was an honor few ever attained - every Eilastes of Ameion was in attendance, the elite gathered to pass judgment on the Herald of Light. ''Finally,'' the Kylakas announced, ''the Synkletos assembled charges you and your people with desertion!''\n\nBut at last, the Herald looked indignant. ''Desertion?!''\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] continued. ''Your ancestors fled your homeland of Aelantir. You shirked away from the duty of rebuilding this land!''\n''Shirked-?! Slander me but don't- twice I answered the Phoenix's call, twice! Did I shirk my duty when I fought with Corin?!''\nAn Eilastes heckled ''a Human's duty!'' The Kylakas continued. ''You violated the Call of Reflection. In doing so, you and your people have forfeited your claim to Aelantir.''\n''Our- our claim-?!'' Ecaris looked outraged, dumbfounded. ''We- I came to save you-! Save all of you! The blood I've shed- the innocents- no, I won't let that be sacrifice be insulted! Never!'' Ecaris stepped forwards. ''And I will NOT let it be in vain-!''\nBut a guard struck him in the gut, and the elf doubled over, spluttering blood as he clutched at his stomach. The Kylakas stood. ''I move that Ecaris Ecarizuir and the Remnant-Fleet Elves are found guilty of all charges presented - and that all such persons under Ambhen jurisdiction will be held on notice! If they do not adhere to our laws, then they will be deported without trial!'' Then [Root.Monarch.GetName] looked down, smirking. ''Do you have anything to say in your defense?'' Ecaris glanced up - but then he dropped his gaze, utterly defeated, and Dawn's Edge shattered at last. ''Good. Then shall we vote?''"

Certainly, our finances have taken a hit. But few dared to openly defy us - few, excepting the Na'Vaidana.\n\nIt appears the entire Sect-in-Shadow has begun to make a fortune off smuggling Taychendi relics to the Cannorians, slipping away from hidden coves along the coast to meet their buyers out at sea. The Na'Vaidana are a criminal organization, of course, and we can't expect them to obey all our laws - but we have a particular arrangement with the Cult of Neravali, and we can expect them to obey our demands.\n\nWe sent a message through the Ambhen underworld - do not deal with them, do not trade with them - and they ignored us. Now, the Na'Casul, the information brokers who hold significant weight over the rest of the organisation, are calling in every favour we've accrued with them - begging us not to crack down on the Na'Vaidana, to temper our response. Plans have been drawn up to purge every last smuggler cell in our lands, including finding and sacking their sanctuary headquarters - now the only question is if we carry them out, or bow to our shadowy partners once more."

 flavor_ameion.88.d: "For 800 years, the Taychendi have known Ameion as a solid, stable trading partner, the go-between with the wealth of the west. The seizure of Anakalnakori by Laskaris came as a surprise - when Laskaris slew the Gophiran King Dhalikar III at Bukénthia, it came as a terrible shock. The Kheionai were coming to invade, like the Chendhyans before them.\n\nBut Ameion is not like the Chendhyans - and as the Chendhyan horde of Zaernmaera lies shattered beneath Laskaris' advance, a wall of Ambhen pikes setting their jaguars to slaughter, the people of the Guaraddhi seem to have realized that. Rakkabuttai, whose sacred mission is to defend the steppe against the Chendhyans, recognise good work done - and recognise that Laskaris has proven himself exceptionally capable of defeating them.\n\nAnd then there is Oremvand. If Ameion ever had a friend in Taychend, it would be them. It was with Oremvandian aid that Ameion once seized Kosphineion and Paraidar, and it would be alongside Oremvand that Ameion would make its first - abortive and disastrous - foray into Taychendi politics in the midst of the wars with Gophira. But their partnership endured. And the Ambhen ambassador - the former general Serondorus Rhadinos - happens to have ''ingratiated himself'' with Queen Vesimathi III. His son with her is half-Kheionai.\n\nIs it any wonder, then, that both have decided to come to join Ameion willingly? In a stroke of diplomatic genius (and with a little help from his ally in Ameion, Irenthenes Gakones), Laskaris has brought both Taychendi cities into his great project - the first of many to come."

 flavor_ameion.89.t: "Wars of Two Heroes"
 flavor_ameion.89.d: "When Laskaris landed in Anakalnakori, and began his attempt to conquer Taychend, another storm was gathering in the north. Erankar Kaonrippavar, the lost last-scion of Urvand, returned to his city, expelled the Enlarmadar garrison, and reclaimed his birthright - within a few years, he had conquered all Larankar.\n\nBut when Laskaris captured Kannalulthe and set the rump Gophira to flight, Erankar had lost everything again - a failed invasion of Nanru Nakar and the resurgence of Enlarmai nearly destroyed his kingdom. Yet still, he clawed it all back. By the time Laskaris landed in Taychend once more, the rebellious Enlarmai burned - and Erankar was ready to renew his conquests as well.\n\nHe is not called Erankar the Defiant for nothing - and his kingdom will allow no state nor warlord nor foreign invader to stand against them. With Ameion's meteoric rise, Larankar knows that if it does not cast us down, then they will be engulfed by the fires of Kheionai civilisation. The war drums of Larankar beat, the riders of the north gallop south..."

 flavor_ameion.90.d: "The vast expanse to the north of Taychend has long been known as a nightmarish quagmire of terrible monsters, uncooperative Bharbhen and vine-threaded undead - not to mention the fact that the entire jungle seems to be alive! For decades, potential methods for dealing with the singing jungle have been a source of intellectual fascination for many of our mages and more daring settlers. To that end, they've come up with a variety of different ideas that generally end in the same conclusion: a very liberal application of fire. Burn the entire place to the ground, then settle the ashen waste left in its wake.\n\nBut recently a section of the elite has been investigating a different possibility, all stemming from one observation - perhaps the unseen force controlling the jungle is actually one of order, not wild, natural chaos? Upon studying the many tribes inhabiting the jungle, it seems clear that their isolation and lack of power seems to be by design, not simply the chance of the environment. Left alone, the jungle seems to be a self-perpetuating, self-contained system.\n\nAnd not to mention that some of those investigators believe that the jungle's mind may be less ''nightmarishly unapproachable'' than first believed. Some even believe that we may be able to entice certain arcane benefits from the jungle. Perhaps the floral symphony of the north can be turned to our advantage?"

While mages normally find themselves allured and drawn to the magical energies of keyanilián, ours find themselves calm and sharp-witted in the presence of this supply.\n\nThe only downside to this material is that we cannot determine how to make more of it, so while it lasts our mages may find themselves the most capable in the world.

 flavor_ameion.114.d: "Unlike many of the other ruins of Taychend, the Steel-Scorched Citadel at the heart of [2500.GetName] was utterly annihilated rather than simply falling into disrepair. The culprit was none other than the last chaotic gasp of the Slaver-Nobles, Ebenanth Starshear. Much of the citadel ruins has already been uncovered, its relics and scrap either sold or salvaged, and it has taken much work to reconstruct a picture of what the ruin looked like before its destruction, but already the findings have piqued our interest, confirming in physical reality what myth had only recalled in murmur - the Steel-Scorched Citadel stands as yet another graveyard of the survivors of Tacenie.\n\nIt appears that most of the Tacenie precursors who followed Liandarha to liberate Aercel (now Nákyra) did not follow her into underground exile - instead, they fled to the safety of this ruin, led by one named Aldatarel. These were powerful mages and warriors, and brought with them esoteric magical techniques - indeed, there is some evidence that they may have been trying to raise a force of non-mage wastelanders to help defend against Ebenanth.\n\nWe have found canvases, enchanted with illusory magic to depict an elf spellcasting, while others seem to perform some form of yoga. Though our mages are able to feel their magic surge as they mimic the tapestries, much more pertinent is how some non-mages have seemed to discover an untapped well of magic by following them. Results have proven less spectacular when attempted away from these training grounds, but allowing potential mages access to this place may substantially increase the number of mages in our society - with this knowledge, we will make sure the sacrifice of these honoured ancestors is not forgotten!"

 flavor_ameion.115.d: "The militaristic ruling class of Degakheion, the Phylaxana, have always professed descent from an ancient class of warriors that guarded the Kheions before the devastating Isolation that followed the Ruin. It was only as we Kheionai began to understand that the Kheions were actually prisons, that their true original role as wardens became clear. But the purpose for such colossal prisons has always eluded us.\n\nDeep chambers within [2736.GetName] have led us one step closer to an answer. The kheions' wards against the Kaydhano were made to keep the entire area safe from external threats, but comparable devices found alongside prison cells indicate they were also made to keep threats of similar magnitude within them. Also, records indicate these wards were built well after the kheions themselves, implying a relatively sudden need to contain such magical strength. \n\nAmongst these subterranean chambers is a library containing knowledge of military doctrine of the applications of magic in warfare, likely intended to serve as something for the inhabitants of this prison to entertain themselves with. It is safe to conclude these instruments were made to contain Precursor mage-generals in a great civil war.\n\nMore curiously, the few books not concerning war-magic seem to detail the politics of the ‘ascendant' one these generals served, who alone could oppose the false gods the Precursors believed in. Our peoples' lack of theology has always seemed normal to us, but this being a deliberate effort of our ancestors is a fascinating discovery.

They are penned in the thousands, implying an incomprehensibly long lifespan, and possibly even an inability to die as the result of aging, with no record marking it as the cause of death.

But everybody knows that Nanru Nakar has a deeper history, the city-once-called Aercel standing as a shining beacon even before the Ruin.\n\nThe Mudaliars, who claim to be scions of Tacenie, have been studying the history of their city since they came to rule it. Our excavations and investigations have proven their base assumptions correct: that Aercel was essentially the capital of Pre-Ruin Andeios, and Tacenie's primary skydock, with the towering Vanetavanem used to teleport unimaginable quantities of goods to the flying city.\n\nBut as we investigate further, and scour the massive undercity (no doubt once used to house Tacenie's considerable supplies), we are beginning to put together a fascinating picture of Pre-Ruin life - alongside an understanding of the tensions between the Precursor Slaver-Nobles, whose ideals would greatly influence the Taychendi, and the Tacenie Precursors, who no doubt were once aligned with those who would become the Kheionai.\n\nThe investigations into Aercel have raised an interesting question, however - what happened to the flying city that was once Aercel's partner? The Mudaliar's claim of descent seems to be undeniable, as does that of the Advakhalla in the north - and so if Tacenie survived intact enough for them to leave that magnificent city, could it be rediscovered today?"

Uyarbaid is home to a Precursor ruin that stands apart from most others in Taychend - though Slaver-Noble stone surrounds them, the core of the ruins is believed to be from a different source altogether, with the towering storm-spire (Uyasmarai) and the seven 'thrones' that encircle it made of a strange, oily black stone.\n\nSome say that the ruins were built by the Storm Giants to channel their magic - evidently, the Precursor Slaver-Noble who came into possession of them believed that too. He adapted the defunct artefacts to become a powerful matrix by which conjuration magic can be channelled - should a relatively powerful mage sit on each of the thrones, their magic can be wielded by a mage standing atop the Uyasmarai (a figure the locals called ''the Uvalarayokar'') and directed at any who come near. The entrance to the Uyasmarai is guarded by a towering Challúmaton, cast in the shape of a Storm-Giant.\n\nThat Challúmaton has since been captured and shipped off to Nagar Vyechei for further testing, while the seven tribes of Uyarbaid, who each built their capitols around their own throne, have been gradually adopting Kheionai practices. This has naturally left the magic of Uyarbaid to our command alone, giving us the opportunity to not only study Precursor methods, but also perhaps others who had once stepped foot in Aelantir."

Though on the outside it clearly follows many of the same architectural patterns of the Slaver-Nobles, once one steps inside one can clearly see the differences - for Ethanan does not represent a continuation of the legacy of the Slaver-Nobles, but of Tacenie.\n\nAfter significant exploration and excavation, including a deep dive into the Khalla Nanri's historical archives and mythic legends, it has become clear to us that the Advakhalla's stories about being descended from the Tacenie Precursors are true. Following the Ruin, it appears that the survivors of Tacenie fled to the hill tribes of Larankar, with whom they had a good relationship. Vanquishing the Slaver-Nobles who still dominated Larankar, they left a distinct cultural imprint on their Taychendi descendants.\n\nEven more so than their cousins among the Mudaliars, the people of Ethanan keep the courtly and artistic traditions of Tacenie, and have even preserved some of their arcane traditions, practising the art of ''Kattyam,'' in which they use their sabres as spell-foci. It seems the legacy of our ancestors indeed lives on in some parts of this land."
 flavor_ameion.119.a: "Our views of Tacenie are based in fact!"
 
 flavor_ameion.120.t: "Gommo Interested in Relics"
 flavor_ameion.120.d: "The International Gommo, an organization founded by short-statured gnomes from Cannor, has sent representatives requesting access to a cultural site of ours to better learn about the Precursors. We are well aware of their hoarding of elven cultural artifacts across Aelantir, but with appropriate oversight may prove a useful resource of information regarding what we find here."
 flavor_ameion.120.a: "They pose interesting questions."
 flavor_ameion.120.b: "Our artifacts are not their trinkets."
 flavor_ameion.120.c: "They will never be welcome here."
 
 flavor_ameion.121.t: "Elves Interested in Relics"
 flavor_ameion.121.d: "Elves, rather those who had fled Aelantir and have lived in Cannor in recent centuries, have come to our land expressing interest in what they consider to be their heritage. While it is true their bloodlines also come from these lands, many in [Root.GetName] argue they have abandoned their stake in Aelantir when they fled east."
 flavor_ameion.121.a: "They are also descended from these lands."
 flavor_ameion.121.b: "They abandoned these lands, and are not welcome."
 flavor_ameion.121.c: "They will never be welcome here."

 flavor_ameion.122.t: "[6753.GetName] Dig Complete" # parakendram. Dust Tear experiments in the vast relic graveyard that the Sarihaddi tribes once revered. Maybe by destroying the last vestiges of normal Sarihaddu life, they can destroy their bharbhen-ness for good too.
 flavor_ameion.122.d: "The Sarihaddu desert dominates central Taychend, an arid expanse in which the hardy nomads of the Sarihaddi roam. Our efforts to bring Kheionisation to the region have been frustrated by the difficulties of bringing sedentary, civilised life to this desolate place - but one of our saving graces has been the large 'relic-graveyards' of the desert, from which the fixed local scavenging industry provides some basis for urban living. It seems that the Slaver-Nobles used the sands of the Sarihaddu as a dumping ground for useless and failed experiments, with the dangerous or malfunctioning artefacts being consigned to the Bukkana Varanya, and the inactive ones to the Parakendram.\n\nBut - ignoring as one must the Sarihaddi's bharbhen superstitions about the sanctity of the Parakendram's relics - perhaps the tribesmen were wrong to consign these relics to a grave and treat 'inactive' as 'worthless.' In a hidden corner of the Parakendram, our archaeologists have discovered an inert Precursor relic that at first seemed to have no value, shaped like a small metal tear. When a mage attempted to divine its nature with magic, however, the relic - the ''Dust Tear'' - began to levitate, and sprung to life.\n\nThe Dust Tear has inexplicitly begun to transform the desert, bringing regular, life-giving rain to the once-arid wastes. As the Sarihaddu blooms, the province's governor is already drawing up plans for new farms and cities, and incentives to attract the tribesmen to them. This certainly raises interesting questions - after all, if the conditions of the land are what is holding back total Kheionisation, perhaps it is the conditions that need to change?"
 flavor_ameion.122.a: "As the desert blooms, a way of life withers."

 flavor_ameion.130.t: "The Search for Tacenie"
 flavor_ameion.130.d1: "Tacenie, a floating bastion of Precursor civilization which evidently fell from the skies as their civilization ended, almost certainly exists in ruins somewhere in the vicinity of our territory. As it has not been found by chance in the centuries since, this grand prize of our ancestors must be sought out by a dedicated effort. .\n\nEvery valley, every forest, every mound of sand may contain the remains of our birthright, and so this will likely take years. The only question is where to begin our search?"
 flavor_ameion.130.d2: "While we have not yet found Tacenie, we know there are still lands where she may lie. As soon as our men are reorganized we may send them to search elsewhere. In the meantime, their next movements must be planned."
 flavor_ameion.130.a: "Prepare to search in the Veyii Sikarha"
 flavor_ameion.130.b: "Prepare to search in the Larankarha"
 flavor_ameion.130.c: "Prepare to search in the Kalavend"
 flavor_ameion.130.e: "Prepare to search in the Kaydhano"
 flavor_ameion.130.f: "Prepare to search in the Devand"
 flavor_ameion.130.g: "Prepare to search in the Chendhya"
 
 flavor_ameion.131.t: "Searching in the Veyii Sikarha"
 flavor_ameion.131.d: "The Veyii Sikarha, or Thousand Peaks, shielded most of Taychend from the worst of Aelantir's calamity. While they could not protect Tacenie from this, the numerous valleys between the mountains hold many unexplored pockets which may hold Tacnie's ruins. With a lot of ground to cover because of this, we must organize accordingly."
 flavor_ameion.131.a: "Prepare Mages to Scry the hard to reach places."
 flavor_ameion.131.b: "Gather ropes for climbing."
 flavor_ameion.131.c: "Recruit the local Effelai for assistance."
 
 flavor_ameion.132.t: "Searching in the Larankarha"
 flavor_ameion.132.d: "The Larankhara Highlands constitute a rough and untamed territory. Their dense jungles and barren hills could easily hide secrets the uncivilized Larankhara could not uncover. The fauna of such terrain may prove hazardous to our explorers, and necessitate a plan to deal with them."
 flavor_ameion.132.a: "Observe them, their behaviors may highlight places worth exploring."
 flavor_ameion.132.b: "Hire adventurers to smite such creatures."
 flavor_ameion.132.c: "Mobilize the army to wipe them out."
 
 flavor_ameion.133.t: "Searching in the Kalavend"
 flavor_ameion.133.d: "The Kalavend river, flowing through both [2495.GetName] and [2500.GetName], has always been a hotbed of Precursor discoveries. While this has helped our cause greatly, it may hinder our attempts to find evidence of Tacenie specifically. How should we distinguish more regular relics from those potentially from the great city?"
 flavor_ameion.133.a: "Have Mages determine which are most powerful."
 flavor_ameion.133.b: "Have Philosophers determine which are more important."
 flavor_ameion.133.c: "Have Artificers determine which are the oldest."
 
 flavor_ameion.134.t: "Searching in the Kaydhano"
 flavor_ameion.134.d: "The Kaydhano, or deathwinds, are the bane of Kheionai, but credit is due to them for driving our people from Alecand to bring civilization to the rest of Aelantir. It may very well be Tacenie's magic which has corrupted the sands into the lethal force we know them to be. In order to determine this, however, these sands must be ventured into."
 flavor_ameion.134.a: "Use ships to find the epicenter of their lethality."
 flavor_ameion.134.b: "Have mages protect our soldiers from the sands."
 flavor_ameion.134.c: "Have the explorers covered from head to toe, even their mouths."
 
 flavor_ameion.135.t: "Searching in the Devand"
 flavor_ameion.135.d: "The Devandi interior is a steep but friendly terrain. Its forests are dense but peaceful, and mountain air thin but crisp. Some have raised the concern that the pleasant nature may distract the explorers from their end goal of finding Tacenie."
 flavor_ameion.135.a: "Keep them reminded of the splendor of our ancestors."
 flavor_ameion.135.b: "Drill them to detest nature and long for the cities."
 flavor_ameion.135.c: "Allow them shifts between searching and relaxing."
 
 flavor_ameion.136.t: "Searching in the Chendhya"
 flavor_ameion.136.d: "Many would consider the Chendhya an empty land, but even grasses can hide many secrets. Look to their blades and you will find bugs, look to their roots and you may see mice or even snakes. Should Tacenie be within these steppes, it will be under this sea of sod, so how are we to best dive into the veld?"
 flavor_ameion.136.a: "Wait for a dry spell, then set it to flame."
 flavor_ameion.136.b: "Use sticks to poke for hard material."
 flavor_ameion.136.c: "Hunt in the manner of the local felines."
 
 flavor_ameion.137.t: "The Search Finds Nothing"
 flavor_ameion.137.d: "After marching in circles and becoming familiar with the terrain, it is proven that Tacenie does not lie in these lands. Our men, while exhausted, do not yet falter, for there are more lands to be foraged through."
 flavor_ameion.137.a: "Tomorrow is another day."
 
 flavor_ameion.138.t: "Tacenie, a Gleam in Darkness"
 flavor_ameion.138.d: "[GetYear] years ago, the skies from which we ruled this world were cast to shadow. While the warmth of the sun would return, the civilization elvenkind built remained in darkness.\n\nIt was within this umbra Tacenie awaited us, and we found her perched between two hills already explored and known to be hiding no such secrets. Several were convinced it was a mirage, for on first sighting it seemed to be untouched, as though we had wandered into the past to the world of our ancestors.\n\nAs we approached, however, the lucid dream returned to reality, as we were met with grayed stones and rotted wood."
 flavor_ameion.138.a: "At last..."

 flavor_ameion.139.t: "Tacenie, a Kheion Awoken"
 flavor_ameion.139.d: "A hollow wind took to the air as we surveyed our surroundings, unaccompanied until a singular bird emerged and began to sing. Turn your head left and you saw a tower still standing and glinting in the sunlight, turn it right and you saw a similar tower decayed to rubble.\n\nIt is clear that Tacenie did not survive the Ruin in one piece, but she was not obliterated in the same manner as the rest of her civilization. As far as one can tell the city has slept here unperturbed since she landed, scant records indicating her surviving inhabitants abandoned her for Aercel, where supplies could be found. Even as they left her, they left her in peace, using what could have been the last of their great magics to conceal her so that she may remain in grandeur when they return. So too did they leave their dead, gently but swiftly laying their departed so they may rest alongside their city.\n\nThe chaos invoked by the Ruin would not see them return to their city, but after many years we have come in their stead. She may never again be spotted in the cerulean skies, but what remains of her buoyant architecture will see us raise our own civilization to new heights."
 flavor_ameion.139.a: "Sleep no longer, dear Tacenie."

 ameion_parliamentary_reform_desc: "The state of Ameion comprises a network of semi-autonomous provinces, called Epaidía, each of which are dominated by a regional capital city and ruled by an elected civilian governor. Each province has its own Synkletos (senate) and Public Assembly, with legislative authority over many devolved areas. The capital maintains overarching control via the position of Kylakas and its numerous powers: command of the state-military, the right to confirm gubernatorial appointments, authority over foreign policy, and in extreme cases unilateral veto over new provincial laws.\n\nBut the growing vastness of the empire has meant that the Epaidía are becoming increasingly out of step with the central government - for that reason, a new parliamentary body has been devised, to which each Epaidía can send an elected representative. This body is dedicated to the efficient coordination of the numerous provinces across the state, allowing them to enact their own policies and voice concerns on the national level."
