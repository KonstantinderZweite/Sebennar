 snecboth_prepare_for_winter_hardship_title:0 "Prepare for Winter Hardships"
 snecboth_prepare_for_winter_hardship_desc:0 "Our weaker neighbors know nothing of a difficult life. Snecboth revere and worship Winter, but that doesn't mean we ignore the hardships that it brings.\n\nMany of our people are in a precarious situation as the season approaches. Communities depopulated by war or famine can be entirely wiped away as the temperatures drop; unless, of course, the sovereign intervenes."
 snecboth_encasement_of_frost_title:0 "Encasement of Frost"
 snecboth_encasement_of_frost_desc:0 "We are perhaps best known to our warmer cousins for our imposing fortresses of ice. These fortresses have long secured us against unwarranted violence from our southern neighbors, but they could stand to be improved.\n\nAdvancements in architectural magic will allow a larger population inside the fortress, while giving us the opportunity to abandon the countryside to an encasement of frost. With luck, any aggressors will tribute Winter with their lives."
 snecboth_arctic_legion_title:0 "Arctic Legion"
 snecboth_arctic_legion_desc:0 "The Tuathak aggression may not go unanswered. We may not have a proud military history, but Winter forges her own warriors. Snecboth are used to scavenging, and they won't demand nearly as much from us as our pampered foes."
 snecboth_boreal_cavalry_mission_title:0 "Boreal Cavalry"
 snecboth_boreal_cavalry_mission_desc:0 "Due to the lack of quality pasture, it has historically been quite difficult for us to maintain substantial herds of horses. However, if we prioritize the creation of cavalry regiments, we will surely find them to be well-suited to the flat expanses of the frozen north."
 snecboth_snow_yet_unthawed_title:0 "Snow Yet Unthawed"
 snecboth_snow_yet_unthawed_desc:0 "The military institutions of the Snecboth are not like those of other peoples. Every soldier knows they fight an existential conflict against the enemies of our people. Our foes would see us dispossessed and driven from this land.\n\nWith such a keen awareness of the stakes, we must ensure our officer corps is prepared to stand fast against the enemy and resist foreign incursion at all times."
 snecboth_necessary_fratricide_title:0 "Necessary Fratricide"
 snecboth_necessary_fratricide_desc:0 "We cannot continue to stand divided. Some Snecboth hold to Immarel's new, more violent Winter Court, others practice the old ways, and yet more of our people toil under the prejudicial hand of foreign rulership.\n\nNo matter how this situation is resolved, unity is the only way our people can survive. Some may have to die to forge that unity, but making such sacrifices is the cost of effective statecraft."
 snecboth_reclaim_darblath_title:0 "Reclaim Darblath"
 snecboth_reclaim_darblath_desc:0 "Darblath and the surrounding countryside are the rightful and ancestral holdings of the Winter Court. Traditionally, it has marked the boundary between our people and our neighbors of the Autumn Court. It has been captured by the invaders and made a staging ground for further incursions into our territory.\n\nIts continued occupation by Tuathak heathens is a source of burning shame for all righteous Snecboth. Let us turn our united forces to the correction of this great injustice."
 snecboth_revenge_on_tuathak_title:0 "Revenge on the Tuathak"
 snecboth_revenge_on_tuathak_desc:0 "Many feel that Immarel's violent reconceptualization of our faith is wrongheaded and foolish, but the ongoing resentment of Tuathak violence has made it highly persuasive, even in those communities that nominally follow the old ways. No matter which way we feel, exacting vengeance on the Tuathak for their transgressions will give us the authority to decisively mend this split once and for all."
 snecboth_a_new_capital_title:0 "Establish the Winter Throne"
 snecboth_a_new_capital_desc:0 "A united Winter Court must have a seat of power that is appropriate to its majesty. A castle of pale-blue ice will tower over the horizon, beckoning all righteous servants of Winter. Our people will know that they are no longer prey, but are instead citizens of an enlightened and modern state that demands respect."
 snecboth_thawing_point_title:0 "Thawing Point"
 snecboth_thawing_point_desc:0 "Snecboth are well known for having relatively tranquil demeanors, but that has not historically helped us with international diplomacy. This will have to change, as the very independence of our people is at risk due to the Tuathak invaders. We must make efforts to establish formal alliances with other nations so that we will be respected rather than derided."
 snecboth_stronger_together_title:0 "Stronger Together"
 snecboth_stronger_together_desc:0 "We must unite what remains of the independent Snecboth realms so that we can take the first steps toward building a proper state to represent Winter's interests."
 snecboth_liberate_jhorgashirr_title:0 "Liberate Jhorgashirran Snecboth"
 snecboth_liberate_jhorgashirr_desc:0 "Tuathak invaders hold dominion over many of our brothers and sisters. Let us teach these invaders a critical lesson that all our children learn: Winter is the season of death that brings rebirth. In this case, it is their death, our rebirth."
 snecboth_snecboth_diaspora_title:0 "Snecboth Diaspora"
 snecboth_snecboth_diaspora_desc:0 "There remain a number of dispersed communities of Snecboth that are yet outside our reach. We cannot claim to be the rightful ruler of all of Winter's righteous servants until we rectify that situation."
 snecboth_sarbann_title:0 "Sarbann Border Port"
 snecboth_sarbann_desc:0 "We have dreams of expansion to the north and east. The development of a port city in warmer waters is key to ensuring we can take full advantage of the economic benefits of these potential colonies."
 snecboth_recover_the_tribesmen_title:0 "Recover the Tribesmen"
 snecboth_recover_the_tribesmen_desc:0 "Our people have long-established, cyclical migration paths. At any time during the year, you have a pretty good idea where any individual Snecboth tribe is located. With that level of regularity, surely it will not be too hard for them to make the transition to settled life?"
 snecboth_make_contact_with_anholtir_title:0 "Make Contact with the Anholtir Snecboth"
 snecboth_make_contact_with_anholtir_desc:0 "We may have dominion over the Snecboth who have begun to settle down, but our people have traditionally been nomadic and they are widely dispersed across the north. We have chosen Anholtir, the site of a significant Precursor ruin, as a suitable site for the reintegration of these tribes.\n\nThe natives of Anholtir share our culture, language, and religion; unfortunately, we may need to teach them some manners if they are to fit in properly with modern civilization. Such efforts are the burden of wisdom, but we will doubtlessly reap the rewards as well."
 snecboth_pretenders_of_pelomar_title:0 "Pretenders of Pelomar"
 snecboth_pretenders_of_pelomar_desc:0 "To the south are the pathetic imposters, the so-called Champions of the Fey. For too long Pelomar has exploited its long defunct title, it is time that they are put down and replaced by those truly worthy."
