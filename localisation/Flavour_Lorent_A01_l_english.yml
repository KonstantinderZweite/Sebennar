 #Events

 flavor_lorent.1.t:0 "The Ruby Crown Awakened"
 flavor_lorent.1.d:0 ""My [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], are you sure you want to do this?"\n"Yes."\n\nAnd that was it. The mages of the Ruby Order performed their unbinding ritual on the crown, in hopes of freeing whatever entity or spirit was trapped within it. It was said that the elf Ioriel, the founder of the House of Siloriel and Mother of Lorent bound her soul to the crown in order to guide the future of the country for the rest of time, and now, hopefully, she would be free.\n\n"The ritual is complete. Did anything happen, my [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]? Is there anything different?"\n"No. I guess it was a fable after all," you reply."
 flavor_lorent.1.a:0 "I was lying to the mage, of course. Now I am free."
 flavor_lorent.2.t:0 "Resistance to Ravelians"
 flavor_lorent.2.d:0 "The Regent Court clergy in Lencenor have long seen the Corinites as an eastern threat, just as Cannor did to the Greentide. It was, for them, a corruption of the faith. For the Lencori, faith should be an equal part of life, not something that dominates it as the self-righteous Corinites believed.\n\nIt was bad enough that the Corinites sought to redefine what they saw as just and righteous, but now the Ravelian Church, an offshoot of the Corinites, now seek to bring religion to the forefront and control all our actions, and of course: under one central authority... theirs!\n\nEven the most moderate of clerics have voiced concerns of this fundamentalist threat, and have banded together to help defend the realm from further religious upheaval."
 flavor_lorent.2.a:0 "We must survive these changing times."
 flavor_lorent.2.b:0 "If Lencenor changes, so be it."
 flavor_lorent.3.t:0 "The Shofa Protectorate"
 flavor_lorent.3.d:0 "As Lorentish ships became a common sight around Noruin, the bat-nosed elves living there became aware that not all invaders were equal; even to them, it was obvious all respected the power of those bearing the Rose.\n\nThe Shofa tribe has bent the knee to the Bone Citadel for decades, and yet with the Citadel under threat from the Onyx Legion, they feel the winds of change. They turned to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] that rules from above a bloody river instead, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] who commands the mightiest armies of the world and whose ships blot out the sun, or so they've heard, and humbly requested protection and perhaps less harsh tributes.\n\nWhile they don't have a lot to offer in exchange for our protection, some of our advisors point out it would give us a foothold right next to the rich Trollsbay, and have already nicknamed the territory Núr Ionnidar."
 flavor_lorent.3.a:0 "They shall become a protectorate under the Lorentish crown."
 flavor_lorent.3.b:0 "We have no need of such lowly barbarians."
