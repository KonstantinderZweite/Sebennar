 U08_ekha_the_chase_desc:0 "1426, the year the nightmare started. The year  Viakkoc first started their incursion into the mountains, south of Khasa; when our sisters asked for help, the Amsachel at the time - Sharil - refused their call in a cynical act of defiance against our old overlord. He knew what the consequences of said refusal would be, and he knew that hundreds would die by that decree; but the prospect of profiting from the Khasani’s plight blinded him, thinking that he could succeed where they failed. After Khasa fell he was among the first to bend the knee to his demonic masters.\n\nWhere Sharil himself failed we have succeeded, however. We have broken the gnolls’ leadership and driven most of the pack to the Salahad, but the pests still infest our lands… It is time to fix this. Sound the Oliphant horns, call the Tretunics and the Vernman in the name of the old alliance: tonight we hunt, tomorrow we will feast."

 U08_ekha_amend_the_ancient_laws_desc:0 "“The mechanisms of our republic are rotten to the core. Traitors and opportunists have managed to infiltrate our institutions and bend the pillars of our republic to their whims; from the greedy Bhiahan and Shukkhan, to the old guard of the Akrohan, we are surrounded by traitors. As Amsakas of the republic I carry the solemn duty to act as speaker for all Ekhasi - my voice is the voice of our people and my position is granted by their wishes. Their verdict is clear - change is required. So, my fellow councillors, and the rats that hide among us, I present two options to you: either we effectuate the change from above, or they will enforce it from below.” - Amsakas Sayir 1450"
 U08_ekha_break_the_chains_title:0 "Break The Chains"
 U08_ekha_break_the_chains_desc:0 "Wine was first introduced to Akasik by our Sormanni friends during the times of Lorenan. They taught us some of their techniques and gave us the means to start our own vineyards, and while we may not be as great at their craft we take pride in our production. The gnollish invasion disrupted all of this, however, turning the flourishing fields of Akasat and Bus-Akasu into slave ports where our people were worked to death and sold. Break the chains of our people! Slay the invaders and return the glory to our lands! We will celebrate the sweet taste of vengeance with wine-stained lips once more."
 U08_ekha_consolidate_the_sects_title:0 "Consolidate The Sects"
 U08_ekha_consolidate_the_sects_desc:0 "The many sects that dot Akasik, hundreds in number, have always been both a boon and a blessing to the Republic. On one hand their constant refusal to obey our secular authority has been a thorn in our side for a long time, as their uncompromising nature and great power has meant that more pragmatic laws and actions have been beyond our reach. On the other hand, it is this uncompromising nature and authority that has saved the republic in its darkest hour, as the orders expelled the gnollish puppets from power.\n\nThe deal we have struck with the Deshati sisterhood now promises to achieve the best of both worlds; with the consolidation of the sects we will not have many disparate voices in the council, but one united voice, able to push for the will of the orders without fragmentation and concession and thus less likely to be influenced by external factors and internal divisions. This will also further unite the state and the orders, giving us a greater amount of control over their actions and institutions, allowing us to allocate them as we see fit for the good of the people, and put the militant arm of the orders to the use of the state."
 U08_ekha_silver_for_gnolls_title:0 "Silver For Gnolls"
 U08_ekha_silver_for_gnolls_desc:0 "Much Akasi blood has been spilt for this moment to arrive, but it is finally here: the scourge of the seas is dead, and Akasik is free once more from the vile grasp of the Kult. However, even if it is a time for celebration, not all is done yet. Some packs still remain in our lands; they are disunified and volatile, but even one kultist with dreams of becoming a Xhazobine can become a disaster if they are not struck down swiftly. We  lost everything once, and we will not bear to lose it again. Additionally all the infrastructure the gnolls destroyed must be rebuilt, and of course the Tefori king still looms in the distance, no doubt planning to strike us down, using our sisters in Deshak as an excuse for our annexation.\n\nIn these times of mingled happiness and uncertainty there is still one matter that dwarfs the rest. The last heir of the kingdom of Khasa has come to us seeking an audience with the council. Bashal Khekasa is still a young boy, but even at his young age he shows great promise, charisma and something more dangerous. Ambition."

 U08_ekha_support_an_akasi_monarch_desc:0  "The Deshaki are pragmatic by nature, that is known to all Akasi. When they invited the king of Eborthíl to their lands after the Packmistress of Brrtekhu had devoured the royal family, many decried them as traitors to our people and cowards, but we see the wisdom and the wit in manoeuvres such as these. However now that Akasik is free from the grasp of gnolls and we are ascendant, we present them with another choice: they may join us in the coming age and we will advance into the future as equals, or they may choose to remain loyal to their newfound king and perish in the coming storm. We can only hope they choose wisely again."

 U08_ekha_drive_them_back_desc:0 "Our sisters indeed chose wisely; the fight against the Tefori was not an easy one, but it was without a doubt a worthy investment, for now all of Akasik is free of foreign actors. Their intentions may have been good and their actions were certainly more benevolent than those of the gnolls. But at the end of the day they were foreign conquerors seeking to take these lands, as so many have done before.\n\nNow that we are rid of them, however, it is time to collect our dues. We have granted the Deshaki freedom from their overlords/ all we ask of them now is that they swear to serve alongside the rest of their people, not as lessers, but as equals. A new storm must come, and it will only come to be when we all advance to the future together."

 U08_ekha_rebuild_the_mountain_temples_desc:0 "The mountain tops of the Akasik may seem like an inhospitable and lifeless place, and indeed they are that way now. But before the gnolls invaded and the kult slaughtered our people they used to be full of life, with hundreds of stonewing villages and monasteries. Those days seem far away now, but we will strive to rebuild the damage done and return the villages and roosts to their previous form… even if these homes will remain empty for years to come."
 U08_ekha_sway_our_kin_title:0 "Sway Our Kin"
 U08_ekha_sway_our_kin_desc:0 "Despite all our efforts up to now, our brothers and sisters in Khasa and Deshak still refuse to fully unite with us in a united Akasik. They cite their concerns over the administrative capacity of the silver council to administer the whole of Akasik, the perceived notion that they will be left as lessers in a union of our peoples despite our best assurances regarding representation. Most importantly they do not trust the integrity of the republic and its capacity to remain true to our purposes as proven during the gnollish invasion of Akasik.\n\nWe expected these concerns of course, and we expected even more the stubborn refusal of our kin to acquiesce to our calls for unification. We are three branches cut from the same tree after all, and we are as hard headed as they are. Thus, on this day our $MONARCHTITLE$ makes a vow before the Mother herself with the blessing of the orders - we will unify Akasik with quill and ink. To prove to all that we have redeemed our name, we will be traitors and cowards no longer."

From Aelantir to Orisopot, from Sigilan to Ekha, our glory is felt, as the herald of civilizations again rises to its rightful place among the peoples of Halann. Akasik stands tall once more, pridefully towering over all, united not as lessers under a monarch, but as equals, all of the Mother’s children working in unison towards a greater purpose.\n\nYears ago we were called traitors, rats and cowards, names we had begun to call ourselves in our shame, but now we have proven that we can be more than mere opportunists, that we ARE more than that. We are brothers and sisters, we are friends and cousins, but above all we are the sons and daughters of this lands. Mother, are you proud of what you see?"
 U08_ekha_bringing_back_the_silver_armada_title:0 "The Silver Armada"
 U08_ekha_bringing_back_the_silver_armada_desc:0 "For millennia Akasik was the naval arm of Kheterata and the greatest navy in the south Divenhal, arguably the greatest in all the Divenhal in fact. Since the days of Sedoric when we were granted the title of “Imperial Admirals”, Ekha has enjoyed the position of foremost naval power among the Akasi; with all the resources we were granted from both Kheterata and Akasik we were able to build the greatest navy that the Divenhal has ever had the pleasure of witnessing - the Silver Armada. This fleet has served the republic faithfully, from the almost constant voyages to Fangaula in search of commerce and riches, to the crushing defeat we inflicted upon the Businori in the Third Cinder War, our proud fleet and sailors have seen their fair share of glory and triumph.\n\nThose days of uncontested glory remain in the past now however, as the rotting remains of our glorious fleet rest beneath the waves along with the gnolls that stole it from us. This has been the only true sadness we have felt in our extermination of the kult, but it's no use lamenting over what we have lost. We have managed to recover our age of glory, and we will rebuild our fleet to even greater heights than before."

Truth be told, a great portion of our population had already been preparing to flee to this new frontier in case the gnolls ever turned their desires of conquest to ones of genocide. With our recent triumph over Viakkoc and the expulsion of all gnolls from our lands, not to mention the renewal of our fleet, we are now in a perfect position to use the assets of this lost Dechani movement to jumpstart our expansion in the new, old world."

 U08_ekha_promote_dechan_pioneers_desc:0 "Our efforts in Aelantir are certainly bearing fruit; our initial foray into these uncharted lands has been even more successful than we had previously imagined. This success is in no small part thanks to the efforts of the Dechani. These intrepid explorers have been at the forefront of our westward expansion; why they would still have such an impetus for exploration beyond the Mother’s Shadow despite the newfound security of Akasik is beyond us, but we see no reason to constrain their wanderlust as long as it remains profitable."

Under normal circumstances these outstanding individuals would act either as independent agents or under the control of the holy orders - now, however, we may use them for more secular affairs. The law is already being drafted and the will to enforce it is palpable even among our detractors in the council. The only question remaining is: where should we centre our efforts?"

Two empires and thousands of years of history have come and gone and yet our kin still seem oblivious to the truth that should have become evident long ago - these lands cannot be ruled with might and power alone. Aro and Biakata ruled with power and might, yes, but they also ruled with a much more powerful tool, gratitude. That is the key to power - for people to be indebted to you without feeling like they are, a gratitude the heirs of their empires seemed keen to undermine, and to which the new warlords of the land pay no mind. Now it falls to us to restore this land and teach a lesson to our cousins, starting with the lands they never paid any attention to."

A people almost as foreign to the rest of Fangaula as we are, they have strict codes and rules they enforce upon themselves in search of redemption for past crimes; and yet with all the virtue and kindness they’ve shown, the rest of Fangaula still sees them as criminals and outcasts. We must strive to fix this rift, however long it takes, and like all reconciliations it must start with small acts of kindness; we’ll take the first step."

 flavour_ekha.0.t:0 "The Silver Tarnish"
 flavour_ekha.0.d:0 "It was two years ago that $MONARCH$’s predecessor, Amsakas Sharil, opened the gates of the city to Viakkoc and pledged servitude to them, two years since we began sending our own to die in the pyres of the kult. Two eternal, soul-wrenching years, watching our kin in Khasa being worked to their deaths and shipped off as slaves; in the midst of this situation the Republic finds itself in a state of utter chaos unlike any we’ve experienced before - factionalism is rampant and our state is in no way prepared to face the turmoil of these last years.\n\nWith the ongoing civil war in Kheterata raging in the east, we have heard whispers of a possible betrayal from the gnolls in Brrtekuh - and the recent moves by our overlord seem to corroborate this story. This may be our last chance to throw off the gnollish yoke and regain our freedom, but we have little time to act\n\nSeeing the dire situation of the republic and fearing the worst should the gnolls perceive further weakness in our states, the various holy orders remaining in Ekha have united in a push, led by the Maddakas. They have invoked one of their ancient rights to force a re-election,  a highly unorthodox move, and the Shukkhan, Bhiahan and Akrohan will no doubt try to repel their attempts at reform. $MONARCH$ is working with borrowed time, but that is all we can ask for now."

 flavour_ekha.1.t:0 "A Planar Offer"
 flavour_ekha.1.d:0 "The leader of one of the Deshati Sisterhood has come before $MONARCH$ with a borderline heretical proposition; she will lend the full strength of her order to the state in exchange for future privileges and the eventual collusion of the many orders of Akasik into a singular voice in the Silver Council.\n\nThis is of course against the laws that have maintained impartiality among the holy orders for a century, and which guarantee all of the orders a fair share of representation under our system, and it would be in direct contradiction with the aspect of resilience. But the situation we find ourselves in is desperate, and she knows that.\n\n“The other orders remain too passive in their approach, even in the face of death! even the Madakas, the oh so holy defenders of the land, advise slowness and to wait for the next aspect…  but our people cannot be saved by clinging to the old order. In this moment when the perfect opportunity for vengeance lies before us we cannot simply wait and hunker down; this is a time for action!”\n\nHer words resonate with $MONARCH$; can we afford to wait and weather the coming onslaught while the body of Akasik herself is being defiled? No. It is time for action. There will be no more soft words, no more compromises and half hearted measures - change will come to Akasik!."

 flavour_ekha.2.d:0 "Today one of our spies managed to contact a member of the Khasani resistance in Viakkoc; we were pleased to discover that it was none other than the governor of Khasa, supposedly a puppet under gnollish control, though that seems to be far from the truth considering the transcript our spy has sent us from their conversation.\n\n“I can still hear her screams, sir. She was a girl so full of life, just 8 years of age, ready to spread her wings, and they took that life from her in front of my eyes, in front of the Mother’s eyes. And the thing that came out of her… It cackled, sir. It asked them to let me live, and said that I am little more than a broken puppet that it can feast upon at any time. Perhaps it perceived weakness and a lack of will in my eyes at that time, I do not know, but I do know that what I felt was not hopelessness, it was determination. I am a defender of this land, I have taken the vows of the Maddakas and served to guard our prince in these dark times, and I have made a vow sir, for the mother and for my daughter, I will not rest until I see these curs driven out of our lands”."

 flavour_ekha.3.d:0 "A diplomat from the kingdom of Busilar has decided to “grace” us with their presence today. The disdain he feels for us is clear and yet his words are soft and measured. The message he carries is short and simple - in exchange for a series of commercial concessions, the kingdom of Busilar will support us in any rebellion against the gnolls; he speaks of redemption, the chance to free ourselves against the gnolls and renew our glory. It is clear to all the members of the council present that his words are little more than poison, a calculated scheme to invest sufficient resources to make the deal enticing, but nothing that will affect them if our revolt goes awry - whereas if we do succeed they will hold a considerable amount of power over the gate of the Divenhal and the riches that flow from Fangaula. And yet, are we in a position to deny aid and bite the hand that feeds us?"

We will dance with the kultists in the same way they started this ode, with a sudden and merciless strike. We will show no mercy to these demons as they showed none to our people. For every innocent sacrificed, for every day of humiliation, we will exact our due. Silence their cackles, now and forever, spare not the children or the elders. When we are done, every miserable kultist that dared step their wretched paws in our land will be dead, or wishing they were."

 flavour_ekha.5.t:0 "Free From Demonflame At Last"
 flavour_ekha.5.d:0 "The days after the initial confrontation with Viakkoc were received with a deafening silence in Ekha. Many had watched their sons and daughters, their parents, husbands and wives leave their homes to lead a desperate revolt against what seemed like an unbeatable foe; no one knew if they would ever see their loved ones again,  what would be of them after this was all over. There would be repercussions if they were to fail, there was no doubt about that.\n\nThen came the dawn of $DATE$, when soldiers came back to their families, bright eyed and smiling, despite the bruises, the pain, and the losses - it was done, the scourge was dead. The city fell into ecstasy as a full day of celebrations and cheers began, a day to share stories and recount the battles, the acts of heroism and the losses. Then dusk fell and the city began to mourn, for all the lost and the fallen, the ones that gave all they had so the rest may live free, so the ones they loved may see a new storm come. The day began with happiness and ended with sorrow, then came the next day, and the only thing that was left was gratefulness, for the ones that left us and for the ones that didn’t.\n\nThe dawn of the next day, a boy made his case before the council - a boy, 16 years of age, that had fought and bled in this revolt for the freedom of his people, and then joined the celebrations on the city after our triumph just like the rest. A boy by the name of Bashal Khekasa, last of his dynasty. The prince asks for his throne back and to be more than the prince that was lost, to be given the chance to be the king his people deserve. Bashal is young, yes, but his charisma and intelligence is undeniable, his support among the people, even our people, is undeniable. But he is ambitious and could become an obstacle if given free reign. The final say, as always, lies with $MONARCH$."

This will not do. Even one Xhabzokultist on the loose is enough to cause a catastrophe if they ever manage to rally enough support behind them.

Hundreds of years of precedent, of laws that our ancestors made to keep Akasik safe, undone in the stroke of a quill… do you think we may be making a mistake?”\n\n“I can not say I do. Thousands of years of precedent were broken when the war was waged and we refused the teaching of resilience, and yet we succeeded. We have risen beyond what we thought we could do, and we have done what we must. It is too late to think of the implications of a simple piece of secular legislature when we have already broken sacred laws.”\n\n“I suppose so… and I sincerely hope you are right.

I would ask before the council that my claims to the palace be recognized and my lawful domain restored.”\n\nHis words are swift and cutting. All know what a rejection of the prince would mean; the alternative is not too enticing, either as the Deshaki have only recently come into the fold and drawing their anger may be unwise.

The fact that until now the republic has survived with little to no reform in a more than good state speaks volumes to the great fundations which it was built upon.\n\nSadly these same strong foundations have also become a great thorn in our side, as any attempt at serious reform is blocked by even the progressive factions, but that must change now. The gnollish invasions have proven that the republic is unable to survive in its current state and our people know it. The general public is galvanized enough that reform will have the complete approval of most factions.

Today we have managed to revoke the title of these last incompetent idiots; we will now dedicate ourselves to finding people more suited to these positions, and make sure to set legislation in place to revoke their position if need be.\n\nEven if this has been monotonous and unfulfilling work, what’s left for us promises to be far more interesting.

The Shukhan were not especially malicious when they precipitated the fall of our army to Viakkoc; instead, through petty struggles of power and sheer absolute incompetence they managed to both fail to protect the republic and force us to recur to the help of holy orders for military matters.

 flavour_ekha.16.d:0 "$MONARCH$ begins speaking standing on a raised platform in the council.\n\n“Today we face a most regrettable trial, for we have come to face a reality that in truth had been festering for a long time. The heirs of Sedoric, people that come from lineages that helped build us to what we are today - in truth they have been part of our downfall. Their role in this tragedy may not have been as active as that of the Bhiahan, but it has had equally devastating implications for our people. Their sheer incompetence and mismanagement has been catastrophic for our military and defence capacity, their petty squabbles in the field fundamentally sabotaging all coordination  and leaving our army in a disorganised and useless state. They may not have organised the coup themselves, but they have been participants in our downfall, willing or not.\n\nFor that reason I propose a new decree to relieve the following list of nobles of their titles…”"

 flavour_ekha.18.d:0 "The courtroom is packed full with attendants. From all corners of the republic people come to behold what is surely the most important trial Akasik has witnessed in its last hundreds of years of history, and which will go down as one of the most relevant in the centuries to come. On the side of the defendants there is a lone man, tall and finely dressed in traditional Fangaulan style. The elected representative of the Bhiahan stands tall even among the sea of murderous gazes that glare at him, and begins to speak.\n\n“My kin, you accuse us of traitorous behaviour not only to the Republic but to our people as a whole; we deny both accusations. You would like to paint us as the villains in this story, “the ones that sold Ekha” but we are more than that, for in truth we are the saviours of this city. Do you think that our walls could have withstood the gnollish assault? That they would have even doubted for a moment  to massacre the city? Despite what all present here would like to think, we made the pragmatic move, the wise decision that was hard to make, the one no one had the guts to make. For our noble $MONARCHTITLE$, are they not traitors to the same law you accuse me of defiling? Did they not break the law of the Mother and our ancestors?”\n\nDeafening silence falls over the courtroom; these last words cut deep into a truth many saw. In the gallery a woman interrupts the silence, raising her voice the leader of one of the Ekhasi roosts speaks.\n\n“And what of you Sharil? You would soon try to draw blame to our $MONARCHTITLE$ and draw a comparison between the two of you, but actions speak louder than words. They were not the ones that opened the gates of the city and allowed the common folk to die while they stayed in their palaces. They fought in the streets with the Madakas to help the people flee, they did not concede the roosts for their “low population density”, you did, and they did not order that citizens of the republic be presented as tribute for the gnolls to appease them. You, you filthy rat and your cohorts were the ones who did that. There is no salvation for you, no punishment fit for your crimes, sweet words will do nothing to help you - you wrote your own destiny in bloody characters long ago.”"
