 ###EVENTS###
 undergrowth_goblin.1.t:0 "Gaslight"
 undergrowth_goblin.1.d:0 "The scouts we sent out of the caves to explore the outside world have returned! They bring food, some rusty coins, an endless amount of complaints about the sun... One of them, [Root.GetUndergrowthAdvisor], has even managed to learn their common language! The court is in heated debate about the details, but the thing that echoes in Grozumdihr among the populace is this... There is a great Raj, and many humans who they rule over."
 undergrowth_goblin.1.a:0 "Interesting."
 undergrowth_goblin.2.t:0 "Goblins of the Tree"
 undergrowth_goblin.2.d:0 "The Tree of Stone, some say it is the origin of Goblins from Grandmother Earth itself. It is an ancient region, with the most labyrinthian and largest cave networks known to the Serpentspine. Goblins have inhabited the region for millenia, and for as long as Goblins have been in the Tree, they have been squabbling with each other over who gets to be the boss.\n\nIt has not been since the times of Grimka the Despoiler that a powerful enough ruler has risen to unite the Goblins within the Tree for long. In that one instance, Grimka almost destroyed the Dwarves. Since then, many Goblins have tried to unite the tree, most of them met with a dagger to the back, or poison in their cup. No goblin proved to be able to avoid that fate for millenia.\n\nWell no more! In the recent centuries, as the Dwarven roads to the west fell silent, the Tree of Stone has seen three clans rise to prominence.\n\nAmbersniffer, the newest of the clans, rising as a clan shortly after the Topaz Dwarves stopped coming down the Roads as a raiding clan, they're even known to attempt raids on Ovdal Kanzad to this day and are constantly lurking around the Ambermines, looking for opportunities to strike out and finish the hold for good through uniting the other clans.\n\nPoisoned Rock, a conniving clan that broke out from the orcish camp of the Anduz Quarry through poisoning their enslavers, using poisonous rocks. The story has been passed down orally for generations, inspiring fierce independence, unwilling to bend the knee without a fight and staking their claim to protect themselves.\n\nDirtwater, the oldest of the clans in the Tree, being experienced travelers, their Shamans passing down tales of their travels and even things such as great battles against the strange tiger-like men who called themselves Harimari. Housed around the ancient site of the Earthseed, this clan has seen the rise and fall of many other tribes, and wishes to put forwards their stake. \n\nIn the Tree of Stone, clans rise and fall often, but these powerful clans, driven by the second fall of Grôzumdihr and of Ovdal Kanzad's stagnation have consolidated their powers, and have openly staked their claim to the whole of the Tree of Stone!"
 undergrowth_goblin.2.a:0 "[Root.GetName] will be victorious!"
 undergrowth_goblin.3.t:0 "A Goblin Hold"
 undergrowth_goblin.3.d:0 "The hold of Grozumdihr is a metropolis of many kinds - Harimari stand guard, dwarves toil in the mines, humans bring goods to trade from their farms... All closely watched by their goblin overseers, with different markings showing which goblin they belong to.\n\nIt is a paradise, for those who don't look too closely."
 undergrowth_goblin.3.a:0 "Our home, our tree."
