 tunnel_events.7.t:0 "The Tûngr Tunnel"
 tunnel_events.7.d:0 "In the days of the war between the Aul-Dwarrov and the Precursor Elves, Ovdal Tûngr was lost. The hold was collapsed and all connection to the rest of the Serpentspine was cut off. The hold was rediscovered and has been developed by the dwarves who fled the incursion of the orcish hordes and their successors. We found the remnants of the passage that connected Ovdal Tûngr to the Dwarovar and despite it's condition, we have been able to restore this ancient road. Ovdal Tûngr can again be the port of the Dwarovar."

 tunnel_events.9.t:0 "Carving out the Havoral Divide"
 tunnel_events.9.d:0 "Our efforts in creating a passage through the Havoral Divide has finally borne fruit.

 tunnel_events.11.t:0 "Breaching Silent Repose"
 tunnel_events.11.d:0 "We have breached into the heights of Silent Repose, the sacred elven monastary. The elves of the monastary and the other elfrealms certainly do not approve of the defiling of their sacred lands. However, this tunnel provides an easier passage to the peak of the mountain. Should we expand the tunnel, the economic benefits are certain."
