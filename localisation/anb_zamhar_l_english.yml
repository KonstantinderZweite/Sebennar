 estate_mages_intertwined_with_army:0 "Mages Intertwined With Army"
 estate_mages_intertwined_with_army_desc:0 "The mages have become a small part of Zamhar armies increasing the morale of troops wherever they go. While the mages may be in a way forced into the military they are still loyal to the state that lets them continue as mages as well as if they do well in the army they can still do their experiments. To the mages this is just a speed bump to get them back into the good graces of the state, whether or not this is true has yet to be seen."
 
 z2z_more_caves_to_explore_title:0 "More Caves to Explore"
 z2z_more_caves_to_explore_desc:0 "As we take more and more control over the caves we have found them to feel kind of endless. While we are quite use to endless caves theres oddly enough ruins and railroads that expand ever southwards. We should check these out and properly re-arm them and ensure that there will be no issues moving forward from any enemies from the south"
 z2z_a_supposed_dead_end_title:0 "A Supposed Dead End"
 z2z_a_supposed_dead_end_desc:0 "As we moved further and further south the expanding caves tended to find their ends and all the branches go quiet. All except for the railroad going solitarily further south. We should find out where exactly this road leads to and if its important enough to bother sending troops to take control over."
 z2z_more_goblins_in_the_caves_title:0 "More Goblins in the Caves"
 z2z_more_goblins_in_the_caves_desc:0 "As we have removed the accursed dwarves from their homes we have found yet another group of goblins. These ones are just as run down and undeserving of holding the goblin cities as the ones we took our home from. It will be a quick effortless job to remove these wretched beings from our land"
 z2z_fixing_the_system_title:0 "Fixing the Systems"
 z2z_fixing_the_system_desc:0 "We may be more centralized than the other countries within the serpentspine but it appears to have come at a heavy cost. Our armies are ineffective and many years behind our opponents. Our government can hardly function during war. Both of these need to be fixed but right now we can only afford to do one or the other. Whatever we do also wont be nearly enough, just the first step of many to having a properly functioning government but the most important step is the first one."
 z2z_scouting_for_knowledge_title:0 "Scouting for Knowledge"
 z2z_scouting_for_knowledge_desc:0 "There seems to have a massive amount of land outside of ours with extremely efficient armies and administrations. We should send spies out there to try and learn what they can and report back to us so that we may catch up to the rest of the world"
 z2z_effectiveness_of_ranged_weaponry_understood_title:0 "Effectiveness of Ranged Weaponry Understood"
 z2z_effectiveness_of_ranged_weaponry_understood_desc:0 "For years all weapons have been made to get up and close to our enemies that whenever we saw ranged weapons it was originally taken to be easy pickings because why kill from afar slowly when you can kill close up and quickly? Ranged weapons were tempermental, inaccurate, and overal even when they did hit didnt tend to kill their enemy. We have then found out that we are blind. Not just in the literal sense but in the military sense too. While once that may have been the case now there are weapons that can accurately blow a person to pieces further away than something can be thrown at them. While we are still blind and unable to properly use such weapons the idea of using them in the future will hopefully not be in vain."
 z2z_testing_new_systems_title:0 "Testing New Systems"
 z2z_testing_new_systems_desc:0 "Now that we have had time to test our systems over the past few years and its successes have shown itself many times over the rest of the suggested changes should be implemented. Finally we have the money and stability to implement the rest of the changes catching us up ever closer to the other countries in the dwarovar."
 z2z_caves_well_defended_title:0 "Caves Well Defended"
 z2z_caves_well_defended_desc:0 "Now that we are in full control over the eastern dwarovar its time to ensure that no outside forces are ever able to interact with us. We have a grudge to settle with the obsidian dwarves and we will not let anyone stop us from enacting it."
 z2z_a_new_type_of_goblin_empire_title:0 "A New Type of Goblin Empire"
 z2z_a_new_type_of_goblin_empire_desc:0 "Goblins have found their roots all over halann from the city state of bayvic to the allclan in western dwarovar, to the overclan, and finally to the remaining hobgoblins in rahen. These nations however are nothing like ours. We are the largest and most successful of the goblin's dispite not being grouped with them. They called us savages and beasts, invaders of the serpentspine, and brutes that dealt with every problem by smashing our heads against it too hard. That old system is gone now though, we are technologically advanced, we have dropped our old ways, we are the supreme kingdom in the dwarovar. There is no other goblin empire quite like ours and we will show the world that it will forever be changed by us."
 z2z_a_new_land_title:0 "A New Land"
 z2z_a_new_land_desc:0 "This land is expansive and empty just like our homeland with one major exception. There seems to be goblins here and a lot of them. Not the normal goblins but a weird darker and taller version. They seem to build great cities like we did as they made the great goblin city that we took and also had made a mining tunnel that seems to go on forever. Right now we are still securing the lands we took but once that is complete we will look towards exploring these mine shafts"
 z2z_old_enemies_new_territory_title:0 "Old Enemies New Territory"
 z2z_old_enemies_new_territory_desc:0 "We have found them. They seem simpler and smaller than the dwarves that we are use to fighting but there are still dwarves here. Our time for revenge is nigh as we must remove this threat before the actual dwarves show up. The dwarves that removed us from our homes and ensured that our only way to survive was up here. We will now remove them from expanding up here with us where we have finally found sanctuary in that goblin city."
 z2z_new_training_grounds_title:0 "New Training Grounds"
 z2z_new_training_grounds_desc:0 "Now that we have control over what seems to be the majority of this area we need to ensure that we can defend it. By building barracks all across the kingdom we will be able to ensure that there will never be a disaster as large as the dwarven invasion"
 z2z_drinking_problems_away_title:0 "Drinking Our Problems Away"
 z2z_drinking_problems_away_desc:0 "Scouting the caves has brought us into an interesting location. There seems to be specific things that each hold specializes itself in but none have quite an interesting creation as this. This hold seems to have made a type of drink that eased those that drink it kind of like how our god controls our population except this is without any kind of holy power. Perhaps this will keep our people under control?"
 z2z_building_an_army_title:0 "Building An Army"
 z2z_building_an_army_desc:0 "We know of the dwarovar now and we know of all the current standing armies that inhabit it. It is time for us to show why we are the dominant power in the region and have the largest army that any nation in the serpentspine can muster. Only then can we continue our route of domination to exact revenge on the obsidian dwarves."
 z2z_new_deepcity_revived_title:0 "New Deepcity Revived"
 z2z_new_deepcity_revived_desc:0 "While we are well aware that these holds are not our deepcities they bare a hefty resemblence to them and as such we will bring our capital city to the same status of the deepcities of old and rename it over one of the many cities that had fallen to the obsidian dwarves."
 z2z_dwarven_armies_dwarfed_title:0 "Dwarven Armies Dwarfed"
 z2z_dwarven_armies_dwarfed_desc:0 "Now that we have been seen as the main power in the serpentspine it is time to ensure that there are no dwarven nations that can even think of conquering us. They may not be the obsidian dwarves that haunt us but they are close enough and as such we will ensure that they will never openly attack us."
 z2z_a_proper_government_title:0 "A Proper Government"
 z2z_a_proper_government_desc:0 "After all these years it is finally time to rebuild our government in a proper and stable way. No longer will corruption sweep the nation and no longer will the common goblin act so harshly against each other. We have reigned in our worst tendencies and have perfected our better ones. With the administration acting as a well oiled machine there is nothing that can stand in our way"
 z2z_all_caves_owned_by_deep_goblins_title:0 "All Caves Owned by Deep Goblins"
 z2z_all_caves_owned_by_deep_goblins_desc:0 "Now that we have nominal control over the caves here it is time to ensure that the caves all the way in and out are ours. No more shall there be a question of how deep do the caves go because we will light the way and find it before arming it and ensuring that no dwarves come magically teleporting in"
 z2z_keeping_the_hobgoblins_out_title:0 "Keeping the Hobgoblins Out"
 z2z_keeping_the_hobgoblins_out_desc:0 "While the hobgoblins may have once kept control of these caves they have since been removed and replaced by us. Now that they are outside and we are inside it should be easy enough to ensure that they never come inside again. Or we can just ensure that they stop existing and root them out once an for all. Either way it will bring stability back to the caves"
 z2z_claiming_control_of_nearby_holds_title:0 "Claiming Control of Nearby Holds"
 z2z_claiming_control_of_nearby_holds_desc:0 "We have found another goblin city! now that we have found another perhaps we can search the caves and find out just what goblins had made such a large system anyways. We have found nothing but mostly backwards cave goblins that could never amount to such engineering but perhaps once we find where all these systems were made or an entity that can tell us how they were made we can continue to not only rebuild but even build more of these goblin cities"
 z2z_undead_hordes_dealt_with_title:0 "Undead Hordes Dealt With"
 z2z_undead_hordes_dealt_with_desc:0 "We have quickly found out that not only does the cave system once again expand as we go south but we have only taken control over a very small portion of what is generally referred to as the dwarovar. Why they would name these lands after such an accursed race and also one that hardly controls this land we do not know but perhaps we should look to take the lands here to learn what we must instead of just asking nicely."
 z2z_cannons_proven_effective_title:0 "Cannons Proven Effective"
 z2z_cannons_proven_effective_desc:0 "During the siege of Ovdal Kanzad there was a deep realization. Knives do not beat cannons very well. While we did take the hold we also paid dearly for each step of the way. We could of course afford to make the replacements it is believed that the best course of action is to first figure out how we can use these weapons for ourselves"
 z2z_damestear_deposit_secured_title:0 "Damestear Deposit Secured"
 z2z_damestear_deposit_secured_desc:0 "We have been trying to expand the usage of our holds for a long time now and we have recently found that verkal dromak has a massive damestear deposit in it. While we are currently unsure of how we are to exploit this it will definitely be a massive boon to the coutnry once we are able to take full control over the product"
 z2z_the_great_cities_restored_title:0 "Great Cities Restored"
 z2z_the_great_cities_restored_desc:0 "With our growing control over the lands it is important that we do not just expand without thought. There are a great many holds under our control and if we are to tame this land we should focus not only on expansion but also on reconstruction. Only then will we be able to dominate the landscape"
 z2z_economies_to_properly_build_a_country_title:0 "Economies to Properly Build a Country"
 z2z_economies_to_properly_build_a_country_desc:0 "We own so much land but all of it is useless if we cant extract the resources and taxes from it. As such it will be important for us to build up our economy and trade to ensure that not only our armies are unbeatable but our economy as well as a strong economy builds a stable country."
 z2z_dwarven_economies_dwarfed_title:0 "Dwarven Economies Dwarfed"
 z2z_dwarven_economies_dwarfed_desc:0 "Now that we are rich it is time to compare ourselves to those that we have to destroy. The Dwarves. We already know that militarily we will crush them we have trained for hundreds of years to do so. No, now we must defeat them in their own domain and crush them economically so that they can do nothing against our superior strength."
 z2z_learning_about_those_that_we_conquer_title:0 "Learning About Those That We Conquer"
 z2z_learning_about_those_that_we_conquer_desc:0 "With our continued military successes across the caves we will eventually need to learn about them. Such as why are there so many different kingdoms here as where the deep goblins were it was all city states, having this many kingdoms would not lost. Then we need to find out what exactly built all of this infrastructure as if we can learn how they built it perhaps we could copy it in our own works."
 z2z_holds_rebuilt_title:0 "Holds Rebuilt"
 z2z_holds_rebuilt_desc:0 "We control over a good portion of these caves but it will eventually be important to govern it. Most of the habitability seems to be in the goblin cities and as such we should ensure that they are in top condition for our citizens to live in if we want any chance of keeping control over our population"
 z2z_picking_the_targets_for_learning_title:0 "Picking the Targets for Learning"
 z2z_picking_the_targets_for_learning_desc:0 "Across the south there are many different cultures, kingdoms, armies, and governments. A perfect place to not only test our troops against a larger threat but to also learn from them. By winning battles and capturing castles for information we can learn from these people without doing such annoying things such as controlling the lands out there."
 z2z_expanding_our_knowledge_of_military_doctrine_title:0 "Expanding Our Knowledge of Military Doctrine"
 z2z_expanding_our_knowledge_of_military_doctrine_desc:0 "We have won multiple battles in the lands they call rahen and we have learned a great many things. Being able to see is very useful outside of the caves, there seems to be a very large abundance of light and we cannot use it. Not only that but running headlong into a battle is a great way to get killed. While developing tactics to not do that as a fully blind army is difficult we can do actions to mitigate it and with some proper equipment and training perhaps we will be able to fix this problem"
 z2z_magic_importance_reflected_title:0 "Magic Importance Reflected"
 z2z_magic_importance_reflected_desc:0 "The battle between the mages and artificers seem to be brewing as both try and control our limited supply of damestear. The mages want it to do more magic and the artificers need it to do more artificery. Both have sent in requests for expelling the other from court. Neither option is good expelling the artificers means that our enhanced weapons and abilities will be limited and any chance of us being able to technologically dominate the serpentspine will be gone. The mages we can live without easier but then we have a bunch of angry mages in our country and dealing with them will be difficult so how much we give and take will have to be decided but there will be no leaving the courts for now"
 z2z_usefulness_of_mages_questioned_title:0 "Usefulness of Mages Questioned"
 z2z_usefulness_of_mages_questioned_desc:0 "Ever since the last conference between the mages and the artificers the artificers seem to have worked tirelessly to prove themselves while the mages for the most part continue doing their own thing. The usefulness of the mages is in question and their waning power means that this may be the time for us to remove them from our country. Or if we wish we can accept them in a much lower position that they will have to work hard to maintain and possibly even rise back up to their stations before the change"
 z2z_setting_up_a_new_base_title:0 "Setting Up A New Base"
 z2z_setting_up_a_new_base_desc:0 "Removing these goblins was surprisingly easy. There was one battle where they charged right at us and we lost, then we find out that was their entire army, then they fully surrender and give up their nation before opening the gates. They must have thought we could get bought off with trinkets and gold but no instead we are here to stay. We murdered the goblins where they lived and hunted them down in their caves. Then we took complete control of their state as an entity with no one left to oppose us. Now we just have to clean up around here any maybe we can start settling down again?"
 z2z_deepening_the_hold_title:0 "Deepening the Goblin City"
 z2z_deepening_the_hold_desc:0 "While we explore our new domain we have noticed that the capital city of the old goblin kingdom is a massive city that rivals the size of the deepcities that our ancestors use to live in before they were destroyed by the dwarves. This city is our chance to rebuild so we should start focusing on expanding back into the old destroyed layers at the bottom."
 z2z_administration_expanded_title:0 "Administration Expanded"
 z2z_administration_expanded_desc:0 "While we have taken control over a larger area of the caves our ability to control it effectively has proven difficult as of late. To ensure that all regions stay properly under our control we should start building courthouses in all goblin cities so that our influence expands well past our main goblin city"
 z2z_expanding_our_knowledge_of_administration_title:0 "Expanding Our Knowledge of Administration"
 z2z_expanding_our_knowledge_of_administration_desc:0 "The first thing we learned when entering the dwarovar is how far behind our administration is from those around us. While we were ahead in centralization it was grossly behind our peers in the caves. Now that we have left the caves we have found that its even worse than we had imagined. We have to learn from these people at least a little bit about how to run our government"
 z2z_native_holy_grounds_title:0 "Native Holy Grounds"
 z2z_native_holy_grounds_desc:0 "While we have conquered many places in the dwarovar there is a place in the so called tree of stone that seems to hold a special reverence for all the races native here. So of course we shall conquer it and rebuild it in our gods name instead so that they shall know who their new conquerers are"
 z2z_mages_accepted_title:0 "Mages Accepted"
 z2z_mages_accepted_desc:0 "We have decided to accept the mages and keep them within our administration although with a reduced role. How they will perform is up to them but they will have their freedom within our lands garanteed to do whatever experiments they want as long as they pay for it."
 z2z_mage_auxilleries_in_army_title:0 "Mage Auxilleries in the Army"
 z2z_mage_auxilleries_in_army_desc:0 "Unexpectidly the poorer people that are mages have decided to go to the army to find work. Doing any kind of experimentation while broke is impossible and now that the state is no longer paying for their activities the various mages have found that the military tends to pay well, works within their abilities, as well as allows them to avoid the eyes of the government that they dont really feel comfortable around anymore. Now that we are able to get the mages into our army cheaper than we could originally we should hopefully be able to see significant results very quickly."
 z2z_mages_working_hand_in_hand_with_artificers_title:0 "Mages Working Hand in Hand With Artificers"
 z2z_mages_working_hand_in_hand_with_artificers_desc:0 "The veterans of war that make enough money from plunder and pay have found themselves once again able to do experiments but also in a position where they have to ask how long they can do it for? So now they tend to work with the artificers in whatever projects they are doing and instead of working against the artificers they are working with them to try and get their inventions to work"
 z2z_mages_integrated_into_army_title:0 "Mages Integrated Into the Army"
 z2z_mages_integrated_into_army_desc:0 "We are now getting mage technologies way more efficiently than before as well as having the mages being apart of the battles in their own mage battalions which generally help the troops in any attack. With the mages properly tended to and with their inventions flooding the markets and armies our army has found itself one step closer to modernizing with the rest of the world"
 z2z_mages_expelled_title:0 "Mages Expelled"
 z2z_mages_expelled_desc:0 "The mages pleas have fell on deaf ears. They attempted their revolution and failed, instead finding themselves at the end of either a knife or a sword. Time and time again they had fought against the artificers and lost all the while keeping their high positions until it finally all came crumbling down. Now there are little to no mages remaining and instead the artificers hold complete control over our knowledge of magic and experimentation"
 z2z_replacing_mages_with_artificers_title:0 "Replacing Mages With Artificers"
 z2z_replacing_mages_with_artificers_desc:0 "The second step of having a nation without mages is figuring out how to restructure it. Thankfully we had a relatively large artificer group within our country so they were able to step in easily and take control over most of the mages work from experimentation and production. Sadly they will not be partaking in the military instead focusing on sending magic enhanced items to the front line so that hoepfully the basic troops can replace the usage of the mages"
 z2z_artificers_weaponry_expanded_title:0 "Artificers Weaponry Expanded"
 z2z_artificers_weaponry_expanded_desc:0 "The idea of all troops being armed by artificers has recently proven to be much too difficult. Instead we have decided that making artificer troops, troops that are equipped heavily with artificer gear, will be the way to go with our army. This way instead of arming every single soldier with artificer gear instead we just arm a percentage of it with all of the best stuff so that they efficiently replace what mages did and act as shock troopers to break through our enemies lines"
 z2z_artificer_weaponry_commonplace_title:0 "Artificer Weaponry Commonplace"
 z2z_artificer_weaponry_commonplace_desc:0 "Now that our artificers are extremely active in the military as well as having their units being the front lines of major battles the need for more and more artificer gear has become well known. Now the artificers hold more power than before but thankfully we can keep a good eye on them."
 z2z_blindness_fixed_title:0 "Blindness Fixed"
 z2z_blindness_fixed_desc:0 "The deep goblins have been in the caves without light for so long that their eyes had for the most part been underdeveloped. They could see very little and this very little that they could see meant that they could use light as a battlefield tactic making both sides blind. While a good idea for the disability we had it appears that we dont need to do this forever. There had been some major advancements in our artificery allowing some goblins to be able to see marginably better! If we could get our hands on some extremely high quality glass to focus our eyes after their use has been reawakened then we will not only be able to see again but perhaps even see better than anyone else."

That was when we were ambushed by goblins and we decided instead of continuing our life of wandering in the deep we would strike back against our opponent and take their lands for our own. Since then we have defeated goblins, dwarves, the exiles of Nixzar and even hobgoblins. We have battled humans and harimari. Finally we created a life for ourselves in these upper caves, bettering ourselves up until now where we shall claim hegimony over all caves.

Why they are here we do not know but instead of wondering why they have taken a goblin city, which should not suprise us due to how they treated our deepcity, we should instead focus on ensuring that they cant call upon their brethren and kick us out of our new home. But first we should remove every trace of dwarves from this goblincity."

 flavor_zamhar.9.d:0 "The mages have been a major player within our government for years. In the past they were this shining beacon of power that all goblins were gravitated towards. They did major contributions to our lives and their power was absolute. Since then however, their place has been taken by the artificers who learn how to share magic with the common goblin. The mages are still too powerful but even they must know that we need some way for them to prove themselves to catch up to the artificers in usefulness. The mages have suggested that we pay them to decypher the dwarven runes and enhance our armies. It will be an expensive endevour but if it succeeds then we will be all the better for it"

The artificers control many aspects of the government with their inventions helping the average goblin significantly. While the mages are stuck purely in the military the less bloodthirsty mages have found that they can help the artificers to avoid military service as no one would say no to an artificer."
