They behave as the combination of a military order and an inquisition, seeking out traitors to the nation and then crushing them utterly.

 ara_order_desc:0 "There has long been a divide between the urban and rural Aranite priests, and when Corin's word spread many of the poorer countryside clergy saw a banner to finally challenge their richer counterparts.

But Corin has showed a new generation of Ryalan priestesses that the old ways are but divine chains meant to subjugate. Now, a new sisterhood has risen, a secret network of women across Cannor once thought docile, using their newfound connections to open routes, opportunities and wealth to once another afforded only women are united, not divided.

Now as Corin's liberation frees Escann, the Balgarites with them have assumed their place as principal authority amongst Balgar's temples. No longer should their clerics focus on grand architectures and artisan works, no, their word echoes that of the days of old: that their forges are the backbone upon which empires are made, the flames that temper the blade of justice, and the steel that reinforces the bulwark of faith."

 nathalyne_order_desc:0 ""There can be no light without shadow" or so these Corinites say. The House of Light seeks to be other side of the flaming torch of Corinite zeal, making sure that as the firebrands lead way with sword and shield, that there is a dagger to deal with cravens and cowards who escape Corin's wroth.

They do not see Dookan as an evil force, but a god of Strength and Mercenaries that toppled the decadent Court and allowed the righteous and stronger Corinism to rise in its place.

Proud and honourable, they stand as stalwart protectors of their communes, safeguarding the lands and people they hold dear.
