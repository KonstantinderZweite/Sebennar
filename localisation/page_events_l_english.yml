 page_events.0.d: "\nThe  1282  Incident  occurred  in  1282  BA,  in  Kheterata.  In  the  Salahad, close to the\nMother's Sorrow, a Cloud Giant castle fell from the sky. It was written down on a temple's\nwall,  and  several  records.  Modern  analysis  of  these  records reveal that the castle was,\nseemingly,  a  feudal  castle.  It spelled a bad omen for the Kheteratans, and, just a century\nlater, The Onslaught occured.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
 page_events.1.t: "1444 Divergence 1 / 2"
 page_events.1.d: "\nThe  1444 Divergence is a theorized magical event in which time itself was dividied into an\ninfinite  number  of  parallel  universes  in  11th  Nerament  1444.  The  theory  was  first\npublished  post-humously  after  the famous chronomancer Varamel the Mad died in 1555,\nand   has   since   become   popular   amongst   mages   within   the  school  of  divination,\nnumerologists, conspiracy theorists and esoteric types.\n\nThere  are  many theories attempting to explain the divergence, and most center around the\nCorin, the hero of the Greentide, who died on the same day.\n\n\n\n==Possible causes==\n===Time Loop Theory===\nIn  1557,  two  years after the publication of the Varamel's thesis "The 1444 Divergence",\nthis  first  theory  was suggested by the then Professor of Divination for the Silmuna School\nSybille  of  Dortmas.  The theory claims that in order for Corin to succeed in defeating the\nGreentide  Vanguard during the Battle of Castonath, Corin and her loyal followers enacted\na  terrible  ancient  spell  in which Corin herself could relive the battle over and over again\nuntil  she  claimed victory.However, it is to be noted that there is no proof for this, and the\nOrder of the Corintar reject these claims as a false and erroneous as an attempt to discredit\nthe reputation and international work of the order.\n\n\n\n===Anti-Corin/Agrados the Deceiver Theory===\nDespite  many  linking  the  divergence  to  Corin's  death,  some  claim that it was Korgus\nDookanson's  death  that  caused  the  anomaly.  Popularized by many orcish scholars, this\ntheory  suggests  that  Korgus  Dookanson,  the  proclaimed  son of their ravenous god, the\nGreat  Dookan,  was  unjustly killed. The theory claims that the god Agrados, manipulated\nCorin  to  kill  Korgus in order for Agrados to absorb the Great Dookan's divine powers to\nrevitalize  his  own.  Many  orcish  scholars claim doom and despair over this, accusing the\ngod of war of manipulating humanity once more for his personal gain - and even claim that\nthe god himself never died and is in fact masquerading as the new god of war, Corin."

 page_events.1629.d: "\n\n\n\n===Corin Time-Traveller Theory===\nSometime in 1640 a new theory was suggested: time was always broken into parallel realms\nand  that  someone  forcefully  caused  Varamel's  chronoanomalizer to trigger. The theory\nclaims  that  Corin  herself  is  a  time-traveller  from  the future who evoked a spell which\ncaused  her  to  appear  in  our  timeline.  The most common suggestion is that the woman\nnamed  Corin  never  existed  and  that  it  was  an unnamed time-traveller from a future in\nwhich  The  Greentide  won  and  had  effectively destroyed most of civillization - and now\nsought to prevent her future.\nAccording  to  scholars,  Corin  either  arrived on the 11th Nerament to kill Korgus and it\nwas  her  arrival  that caused the named divergence, or that it was her death in our timeline\nthat  caused  the  chronoanomalizer  to  activate. Another known theory suggests that Corin\nwas  a  student who was accidentally sent back in time and used her historical knowledge to\nsufficiently combat the Greentide successfully as in her own timeline.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
 page_events.2.t: "525 Azka-Sur Grand Circuit 1 / 5"
 page_events.2.d: "\nThe  525  Azka-Sur  Grand  Circuit  was  a  grandiose  expedition  sent  out by the Lord of\nParusad  Bhola,  Dharendranarayan  of  the  Ruby  Garden. The goals of the Grand Circuit\nwere  the expansion of trade contacts and opening diplomatic negotiations, the other aim of\nthe  Grand  Circuit  was  the  acquisition of exotic plants and flowers to further enlarge the\nRuby Garden. Dharendranarayan also used the expedition to display the wealth of the at the\ntime thriving lordship.\n\nThe  expedition  would  travel westward, stopping at all the major cities of Rahen that were\non  the  route  to  Bulwar,  eventually ending up in Davarrhal. From there the large convoy\nwould  make  the  dangerous  crossing  over  the  Salahad dessert, to reach the grand city of\nAzka-Sur.  Although  smaller  parties  sent  out  by  the  expedition  would end up as far as\nGelkar and Aqatbar.\n\n== The Goal ==\nThe Grand Circuit had multiple goals, all equally important.\n\n#  The first goal was the opening of diplomatic negotiations. Dharendranarayan of the Ruby\nGarden  wanted  to  forge  alliances  and  defensive  pacts to ensure the continuation of the\ncurrent  prosperity and to shore up the geopolitical strength of Parusad Bhola. He hoped to\nwow   larger   lordships   into  opening  negotiations,  utilizing  the  wealth  and  prosperity\ndisplayed by the great convoy.\n#  The  second  goal was the expansion of trade networks across Rahen, this is also why the\nCircuit  stopped  among  the  most  important  cities  on  its  way westward. Parusad Bhola\nwished  to  expand  its trade networks to enlarge their imports, which Parusad Bhola would\nsupport  with  an  increase  in  the  export of medicinal herbs. This was possible due to the\nherbs from the Ruby Garden being higher in quality than others in the market and due to a\nrecent expansion of said herb garden.\n#  The  third  goal  of the expedition was the expansion of the Ruby Garden. Wherever the\nGrand  Circuit  went  the  botanists of the expedition would be sent out to search for exotic\nplants and herbs not yet in the Ruby Garden. It would be this goal the expedition would be\nmost  famous  for,  as this was the public face of the expedition and the goal that succeeded\nbeyond expectations."

 page_events.1630.d: "\n\n== The Composition ==\nThe  expedition  would  be a large gathering of people, from different races, classes, castes,\nand  nations.  The  expedition  would  be  supported by a contingent of the Parusad Bholan\narmy,  who  were to always guard the expedition. Botanists were of course also a part of the\nexpedition; they collected new plants and herbs and kept them alive until they were brought\nto  the  Ruby  Garden.  Diplomats/nobles were also part of the expedition and were due to\ntheir  status part of the leadership. Although the head of the expedition would be one of the\nsons  of  Dharendranarayan,  Chaturanan.  The  expedition  would  be  assisted  by  a large\ncivilian  following,  cooks,  cleaners, smiths, grooms, etc. Adventurers also formed a small\npart  of  the  expedition;  they  were  most common in the vanguard. The expedition would\ncontain around 8000 men at the start.\n\nHumans  made  up  a slim majority of the expedition, with Harimari being a close second.\nIn  the expedition there would also be a small minority of Dwarves and even a few Harpies\nwho joined the expedition during the trek through the Salahad.\n\n== The Route ==\n\n=== Rahen ===\nThe  Grand  Circuit  would first travel towards the Porcelain city of Khisrapid, after which\nthe  grand  convoy  would  make its way down the Kharunyana river towards the rich city of\nSramaya.  There the expedition would remain for two grand weeks of celebration and trade,\nduring  which  the  leader  of  the  expedition hashed out an important trade agreement and\nalliance  between Parusad Bhola and the lord of Sramaya. Sadly, the alliance would quickly\ndissolve  after  the  lord  of  Sramaya  died  soon after the expedition left, his heir seeing no\nreason to keep the alliance.\n\nThe  next  destination  was  Sardiphandin,  where the only real progress regarding alliances\nwould  be  made.  The  lord  of  Sardiphandin  was  enthusiastic about signing treaties with\nParusad Bhola and for the month the expedition was in the city a celebratory mood hung in\nthe city, with feasts being organized every other day."
 page_events.1631.t: "525 Azka-Sur Grand Circuit 3 / 5"
 page_events.1631.d: "\n\nAfter Sardiphandin the convoy would travel to Dhenijansar, where Chaturanan would meet\nwith the Raja. Pledges and promises were made, and feasts were held in honour of the Raja\nand the lord of Parusad Bhola, but nothing meaningful would be negotiated due to the Raja\nbeing  unable  to  commit  to  anything  because  of  the  rising  military independence and\nregionalism.\n\nSarkhashabid  was  the  next  destination; the expedition was refused entry by the leaders of\nthe  city.  Entry  was  refused because the lord of the city held grievances against the lord of\nParusad  Bhola  when  the  lord  of  Parusad  Bhola had unintentionally insulted him. As a\nresult,  no  large  celebrations  were  held  in  Sarkhashabid,  negotiations over a treaty still\nhappened  but  in the end they failed. Chaturanan did manage to send out a small botanical\nparty to Sarhal, this small detachment would make it home safely in early 528.\n\nWhen  the Grand circuit arrived in Davarrhal large parts of the civilian following were sent\nhome  back  to  Parusad  Bhola,  to  bring  back  the  riches  traded  for so far and to avoid\nunnecessary  deaths  in  the  Salahad  desert.  In  Davarrhal  the  expedition focused on the\npreparations for the crossing, this would be one of the largest recorded expeditions to cross\nthe  Salahad  so  far. To ensure a steady supply of water, deals with the Masnish were made\nto  prepare  outposts  and  oasis  for  the arrival of the grand convoy. The expedition would\nleave for Azka-sur in late 526.\n\n=== Bulwar ===\nCrossing  the  Salahad  would  be  a  large  undertaking,  deals  were  made  with  the local\nMasnish  tribes  to  protect  and guide them as well during the crossing. This would not be\nenough,  and  the  leaders  of  the  expedition would be forced to make deals with the local\nharpies,  after  a  few devastating raids by the local harpies. The expedition would cross the\ndesert  via  the  north, to send out a small party to the dwarves of Verkal Gulan. The small\ndiplomatic mission was however refused entry into Verkal Gulan. The grand convoy would\nfinally reach Azka-sur in early 527."
 page_events.1632.t: "525 Azka-Sur Grand Circuit 4 / 5"
 page_events.1632.d: "\n\nWhen  the  expedition arrived at the gates of Azka-Sur it is said the locals heard the ground\nshake  and  were perplexed as to how such a large convoy could have successfully made the\ncrossing.  In  reality a vanguard was sent out to the lord of Azka-Sur so that he could make\nproper  preparations,  killing  any  sense  of surprise. The lord of Azka-Sur would welcome\nthe  expedition  with  open  arms, giving them a small plot of land outside the city to set up\ncamp,  where  a  small city made up of tents would emerge. The stay in Azka-Sur would be\nvery  pleasant  for  both  sides,  there  were  large scale exchanges of knowledge and goods.\nFurthermore,  the  lord  of Azka-Sur organized multiple games and even debates like in the\nHall  of Endless Debates. Just before the expedition would depart after having stayed for six\nmonths the lord of Azka-Sur would sign a treaty of Friendship with Parusad Bhola.\n\nThe  advanced  guard  of  the  expedition  would  however not stop in Azka-Sur. Botanists,\nArchitects  and  other specialists would be sent to larger Bulwari cities along with guards to\ngather  more  knowledge.  Parts  of  the  vanguard  would  make  it  as far as Aqatbar. It is\nbecause  of  these  vanguards  that  the  hanging  gardens  would  be introduced to the Ruby\nGarden, as well as the Pomegranate, the Orange and other fruits/herbs.\n\nThe  return  journey  would  start  when  the last of the advanced guard would return in the\nmiddle  of  527.  Due to the previous deals being made with local harpies and Masnish the\nconvoy  could  safely make the return journey across the Salahad with all the bounties from\nBulwar.  When  the  expedition  would  arrive in Davarrhal they would buy large transport\nships  and  sail  towards  Sramaya,  relations  between  them  and  Parusad  Bhola were still\nfavorable  regardless  of the alliance not having been renewed. The expedition would return\non   the   1st   of  Nerament  529  being  welcomed  by  a  grand  feast  organized  by  lord\nDharendranarayan of the Ruby Garden.\n\n== The Result ==\nThe expedition had a mixed success. While the botanical aspect of the Grand Circuit was a\nsmashing success, with many plants/herbs/fruits/architectural styles being introduced to the\nRuby Garden. The diplomatic and economic aspects of the expedition were less successful,\nwith  only  one  of  the  treaties  made  surviving.  This failure to forge any lasting alliances\nallowed  Ghospar “the Iron tail” to seize the lordship in 533. The expedition would also be\na huge strain on the treasury, the trade treaties made not earning enough to break even."

 page_events.1633.d: "\n\nThe  expedition  can  also  be described as a massively lucky one, despite the failings of the\ntreaties  and  the  large  burden  upon the treasury. This was because no great tragedy befell\nupon  the  expedition, despite the tumultuous times in Rahen due to the increasing military\nindependence and regionalism.\n\nThe   expedition  would  also  be  massively  successful  in  the  legacy  it  left  behind;  the\ngrandiose  expedition further enhanced the legacy of the Ruby Garden dynasty. Word of the\nRuby  Garden  and  the  lordship  spread  throughout  Bulwar  and  even into Cannor, with\npeople  hearing  tales  of the most extravagant trade convoy ever seen hailing from the most\nbeautiful  and  lavish  garden  in  the  world. Some rumors even said that the Ruby Garden\nrivaled the garden of Surakel himself.\n\n== Plant Acquisition ==\nThe  grand circuit brought about a substantial increase in the number of plants/flowers and\nherbs in the Ruby Garden.\n\n*   Multiple   medicinal   herbs  were  brought  back  to  the  Ruby  Garden:  Black  seeds,\nChamomile flowers, sage plants, thyme, and Myrrh were brought back from Bulwar. A few\nCannorian  herbs  were  bought  on  the  market of Aqatbar as well, such as Crosswort and\nComfrey.\n*  Multiple  fruits  were  introduced  as well: oranges, pomegranates, figs, olives, dates and\nunknown species of apples, pears, and many others.\n*  Furthermore,  a  small  number  of  trees  and  flowers were brought along as well, most\nnotably  the  Acacia  and  the  Ghaf  trees. The blood lily, red acacia, tulips, and the desert\nrose were the most notable flowers brought back to the Ruby Garden.\n\nAll  these  plants brought back from the expedition would help the Ruby Garden grow even\nlarger in size and collection.\n"

Over  the  next  21  years,  Nichmer  was defeated, and Jaher\nconquered Bulwar.\n\nThis age marked the rise of elvenization throughout Cannor and Bulwar and great upheaval\nfrom the old order. Magic became increasingly common, and eventually became a constant\nwithin  the  Cannorian  nobility,  who  had also intermarriedwith the elves, creating a more\nhalf-elven   dominated   noble  circle.  The  White  Pestilence,  an  undead  plague  would\neventually  hit  Cannor  which  furthered  the shift to elvenization.

In  Gerudia, the dragon Elkaesal the White brought forth the Era of\nFrost  turning  the  land to eternal winter until, according to legend, she was lulled to sleep\nby  the One-Armed Skald, which inspired the emergence of the Skaldhyrric Faith along the\nnorthern coast of the Giant's Grave Sea.\n\nThe  rest of the age was characterized by more events that lowered stability in Cannor. The\nWar  of  the Blade occurred, continuing to low Castanorian stability. The Third Xhaz rose,\nand  met  her  end  at  the hand of Daravan the Malignant but saw much of lower Dostanor\nflooded   into  Daravan's  Folly.  For  the  people  in  Gerudia,  the  combination  of  long\ndevastation  from the Era of Frost and internal unrest led to the northern peoples to look to\nthe  south  for  new  lands and riches, ushering forth the Era of Black Ice - which saw these\ngerudian  reavers  raiding,  trading and settling in Cannor. In one case a reaver managed to\ntake  control of the ancient empire of Castanor, naming himself Castan Ebonfrost. The rise\nof the Ebonfrost Dynasty led to a resurgence in Castanorian hegemony over their old lands,\nbut  also  led  to  corruption  and  nepotism,  especially in the Trials of Castan, where they\nskewed and outright prevented claimants not of their dynasty from attempting."

 page_events.12.t: "Age of Petty Kingdoms 1 / 2"
 page_events.12.d: "\nThe  Age  of  Petty Kingdoms is the name given to the history of Bulwar between the fall of\nAakhet  the  Bronze in 488 AA and the arrival of the Sun Elves in 1001 AA. This period is\ncharacterized  by decentralization, with dozens of city-states and akalates, both independent\nand  subordinated  to  either  gnoll packs and harpies, that were unable to consolidate large\nterritories.  The  balance  of  power  shifted over time, with periods of greater human rule,\nand gnoll packs were less stable than the classical kingdoms of the Age of Monsters.\n\n\n\n=== Birth of the Mašnsih ===\nWhile  we  have  archeological  evidence of the Mašnsih from the I century AA, during the\nAge  of  Petty  Kingdoms we see the rise of a Mašnsih culture and identity. The settlements\nof  Edešukeru,  founded  by  the  remains  of  Aakhet's army, and Šimlardu, founded by the\nszal-Ayarzil  tribe,  became  points  of  reunion  of  the  tribes  and  centers of trade for the\ncaravans that travel through the Salahad, from Rahen and Sarhal to Bulwar.\n\nThe  most  important  event  of the period was the establishment of the Sihrušam, the Sand\nBanner.  In  980  AA  the  leaders  of  the  szal-Ardeth,  szal-Adad,  szal-Zaid,  szal-Attalu,\nszal-Yazkur,  szal-Surubaz  and  szal-Ayarzil  tribes  reunite  in  Šimlardu  to respond to the\nthreat  of  the  szal-Belil  tribe,  who  had  become  powerful due to their alliances with the\ngnolls,  and  who  did  not  hesitate  to  capture  entire  tribes  to  sell  them as slaves. The\nSihrušam  was  established as a pact of defense, offence and general mutual aid between the\nseven  major  Mašnsih  tribes. The war against the szal-Belil lasted 2 years, and ended with\nthe almost destruction of the tribe, who fled to the Harra Oasis.\n\n=== Maqet's Rebellion ===\nA  slave of Brassani descent born in the kingdom of Xharraranaz, that controlled the city of\nBulwar  and  the  middle  Suran  plain  at  the  time,  he  believed  for  most of his life that\noppressed  shall  rise  and  not  wait  for  Surakel’s  return.  Moreover  for  Maqet  and his\nfollowers  the  fight  was  not  against  an  unidentified  Malevolent  Dark  but  against  the\nXhazobines  and  their  cult.  In 916, he took control of the town of Anzarzax and began to\nroam  the  Buranun  and  the  Suran  plains  to  free slaves and establish a true independent\nBulwari  kingdom  against  the  Gnolls.  This  lasted  around  10  years,  when  he notably\nmanaged  to  retake  the  citadel of Ekluzaganu with the help of the King of Zanšap. But in\n925, the gnolls had enough of his actions and began to unite to crush the rebellion. Around\n926,  he  instructed his son Dasma to flee east for he had a vision of a holy land in the east\nfrom  where  the Light could be sheltered. With his elite men he fought as long as he could\nagainst the gnollish packs but was captured and tortured."
 page_events.1636.t: "Age of Petty Kingdoms 2 / 2"
 page_events.1636.d: "\n\nNonetheless,  the  Maqeti  rebellion  managed  to  flee east into the Harra oasis. They met\nwith  several  Mašnsih of the szal-Erol tribe who knew the ways of the desert. Knowing that\ngnolls  were  still  on  their  tracks,  Dasma  continued  his  walk  across  the desert, losing\nhundreds  of  men,  women  and children to the sand dunes. Eventually he reached the sea,\nfollowing  the  coast  until he found good land. There, in 930, he massacred the gnolls that\ninhabited  along  the  river, freed their slaves and established his kingdom, which would be\nknown  as  Dasmazar.  He  would reign until 976 when he was buried on the holy island of\nDasmatuš by his son Idras.\n\n=== The Millenial Sun ===\nThis  period also saw the rise of several sects within the Sun Cult, especially in the western\nareas.   These   sects,   denominated  Surkaniš  cults,  believed  in  a  coming  fundamental\ntransformation  of  society,  marked  by the return of Surakel in corporeal form, to lead the\nBulwari  into  a new age of Light and prosperity. While active since the end of the Imperial\nEra,  the  Surkaniš  would  become  more  active  in  the  10th  century AA. Some scholars\nindeed  believe  that  a  Surkaniš  cult  was  behind  Maqet’s  rebellion  who  was  the main\nrebellion against gnoll rule in Bulwar before the Landing.\n\nThe  apparent  failure  of  Maqet  convinced  many of the Bulwari new sects that they were\nliving  in  the  Age  of  Darkness, the end times, and that Surakel would return during their\nlifetimes.   The   political   instability,  oppression  from  gnolls  and  harpies  and  general\nincapacity  of  human  rulers  to  protect  their  own people sowed the seeds of several sects\nwithin  the  cult, some more widespread than others. While most members of these groups\nwere  part  of  the  peasantry,  there  are known members within the ruler class, such as the\nGrand  Maraš  Asor  of  Brasan,  the  king  Hussaam  of  Bahar or the king Bavar Pasha of\nZanšap.\n\nWhen  Jaher  landed  in  Brasan,  the  first  ones  to recognize him as Surakel Reborn were\nmembers  of  these  sects,  while  the  Sun Cult orthodoxy, represented by the priesthood of\nEduz-Vacyn rejected those claims."

Agrados'  progeny  from the rape of Castellos' wife,\nHalanna,  formed  the  Beast  Gods  and  the  Spawns  of  Agrados,  while his dark essence\nabsorbed by his brother caused the creation of Kazraiel, one of the Dukes of Hell.\n\nDuring  the  Greentide,  a  young  human  named  Corin became the avatar of Agrados and\nsaved  Cannor  from  the orcish onslaught. This action redeemed Agrados and let him have\npeace. In turn, Corin became the new god of war in Agrados' place.\n\n==Historical Origins==\nThe  origins  of  Agrados  lie with the Alenic tribes that inhabited the Alenic Frontier. The\nAlenic  peoples  were described by one scholar as "a war-like people more beast than man,\nwelcoming  glorious  death  in  battle as second nature to appease their dark god".

 page_events.15.t: "Ahati 1 / 4"
 page_events.15.d: "\nRoughly   equivalent   to  the  knights  of  Cannor,  the  ahati  are  the  traditional  warrior\nbrotherhoods  of Kheterata. Though once organized as a form of petty nobility, the modern\nbrotherhoods   recruit   primarily  from  the  commons  and  hold  no  formal  government\nrecognition  - nevertheless, each ahati considers himself equal in stature to even the highest\nnoble. They have played a significant role in Kheteratan history, known at varying times for\ntheir  fanatical  loyalty to the draconic king Aakhet as well as their enthusiastic adoption of\nDamerian notions of honor and meritocracy during the Damerian Republic’s reign over the\nSorrow.\n\n==Characteristics==\nThe  ahati  identify  strongly  as  a  distinct  group within Kheteratan society, with a unique\nculture  and  even  religion  from  the  rest  of  the  nation.  Adhering tightly to the code of\nminisris, or manliness, which calls for devotion to the people, the cultivation of virtue, and\nthe  eradication  of  injustice  and  misrule.  This  has  made  the  ahati  some  of the most\nenthusiastic  defenders  of  Kheterata  and servants of those rulers they deem just, yet it has\nalso  brought  them into conflict with many less virtuous kings - several of whom have died\nto  ahati  assassins, with the assassins then disemboweling themselves to atone for the sin of\nregicide.\n\nThe  ahati  brotherhoods follow a sect of Khetism known as Peyimaaw or, in Common, the\nAvenger  Cult.  Originally  a  sect  devoted  to  the  state  as  protector  of  the  people and\nupholding  meritocracy,  modern-day  Peyimaaw  retains  its  meritocratic doctrines but has\nshifted   its   loyalties   to  the  ahati  brotherhoods  themselves  as  the  true  protectors  of\nKheterata.  It  has  no  dedicated  clergy.  Instead,  the  ahati rotate the position of ritualist\nbetween them.\n\nA  note should be made on the differences between the northern brotherhoods and southern\nbrotherhoods,  born  from  the  reign  of  Aakhet. Where the northern ahati remain strictly\nmilitary  brotherhoods, the threat of gnoll raiders has led to the merchant class and warrior\nclass  of  Irsmahap  -  the  southern  Sorrow - being largely synonymous. As such, southern\nahati   brotherhoods   took   on   the  aspects  of  trade  guilds  and  largely  controlled  the\nIrsmahapan   economy   before   Grizaka's   Invasion  saw  the  fall  of  Irsmahap  and  the\ndecimation of the brotherhoods."
 page_events.1637.t: "Ahati 2 / 4"
 page_events.1637.d: "\n\n==Early History==\nThough  tracing their origin to the rebel groups that overthrew Castanorian rule, which had\nused  the  same  name,  the ahati brotherhoods properly originated with the fall of the First\nDynasty  of  Kheterata. A military coup led by the general Menkaunswt, later known as the\nWarrior  King, would overthrow King Intef III over the King’s desire to ally with Castanor.\nAs  thanks, and to shore up his power base, Menkaunswt would grant his soldiers the status\nof lesser nobility and direct vassals of the King under the title of ahati.\n\nNow   established   as   a  distinct  martial  class,  the  ahati  were  the  core  supporters  of\nMenkaunswt’s  Second  Dynasty  but  would  hold  far looser loyalty to following dynasties,\nwith  only  the  dragon king Aakhet gaining their total obedience. Indeed, a few later Kings\nwould  find  themselves  outright  assassinated  by  the  ahati  after being declared agents of\ninjustice.\n\n==The Damerian Period==\nThough  the  ahati  would  valiantly  fight  alongside  the  royal army against the Damerian\nRepublic  during  its  invasion  of  Kheterata,  they would eventually be defeated. With the\ncrowning  of the Damerian Luminary by the Khetarch, the ahati would accept defeat and in\nfact  become  some  of  the  fastest adopters of Damerian culture. Exposure to a republican\nform  of  government  would  greatly  influence  the  ahati,  with the code of minisrit owing\nmuch  to  Damerian  influence,  and  they would form a strongly pro-Damerian bloc inside\nKheterata alongside the coastal merchant houses.\n\nWith  the  resurrection  of  Elikhet,  and  his eradication of Damerian influences, the ahati\nwould  adopt  aspects  of  a  secret society to keep the ideals of minisrit alive. A handful of\nradical  ahati would even go so far as to question the deeds of Elikhet himself, while others\nbelieved  him to be not resurrected but a demon-possessed corpse. Both views were harshly\nsuppressed  by  the  ahati  leadership, but their very existence shows the depth of the ahati’s\nadoption of Damerian ideals and hostility to a returned traditionalism."

 page_events.1638.d: "\n\nThough  none  dared  act  while  he  still ruled, after Elikhet’s return to his sarcophagus the\nahati  would  come  out  of  hiding  to  openly  defy and challenge the traditional regime of\nPanaoute  I  that  now  ruled  Kheterata,  leading  to  a new balance between the traditional\npriestly  elites  and  their  ahati  rivals  with  successive  dynasties  siding  with  one side or\nanother.\n\n==The Dragonwake==\nWhen   the   dragon  Aakhet  rose  from  the  inaccessible  depths  of  the  Pyramid  of  the\nWarrior-King  to  challenge  the  Khetarchy  for  control,  the struggle between the priestly\nnobility  and  the  ahati  would  erupt  into a civil war as an old prophecy would lead to the\nahati siding en masse with the dragon.\n\nFollowing  Aakhet’s  victory,  the  ahati  would be reorganized into professional legions and\nserve  as  the  vanguard  of his invasion of Bulwar, which was mythologized as both the lost\nhomeland   of   the   Kheteratan   people  and  a  land  of  sin  and  depravity.  Many  ahati\nbrotherhoods  are  granted  control  over  Bulwari  city-states,  serving  as Aakhet’s primary\noccupation forces while the royal army itself continues to march east.\n\n==Crodamic Period==\nWith  Aakhet’s apparent death at the hands of the Sand Demon of the Salahad, and none of\nhis  generals  willing  to  accept  each  other  as  his  successor,  his  Bulwari empire would\ncollapse.  Meanwhile,  the  Kheteratan homeland would find the conflict between ahati and\npriest  suddenly  reignited.  To avoid another civil war, the Khetarch Benukhet would offer\nthe  crown  to  Sedoric  I  of  the  House  Crodamos,  King  of  Akasik  and  leader  of the\nCrodamic  people.  With  his  fresh and well-trained army, and boasting the support of the\nKhetarch himself, Sedoric would march into Kheterata and swiftly secure his rule.\n\nNow  faced  with  the  Crodamic  nobility  as  another  rival  for  power,  for  despite their\nassimilation  into  Akasi  and  then  Kheteratan  culture  they  retained  a  distinct political\nidentity,  the  ahati would double down on their meritocratic and populist roots, appointing\nthemselves  the  champions  of  the  common-folk  against  tyrannical  nobles  and  corrupt\npriests.  A  cultural  split  between  the  northern  and  southern  brotherhoods  would also\nemerge around this time, as the northern ahati of the Mother’s Sorrow weathered the direct\nattention  of  the  Crodamic monarchy by turning ever more insular and secretive while the\nsouthern ahati of the Irsmahapan savannah instead leveraged their distance from the capital\nto  gain  more  and  more  autonomy  from  the crown, largely merging with the Salahadesi\ntrading guilds in the process."

Close  to  the Dwarf fortress of Seghdihr, it is also the\neasternmost city before the Salahad desert and also close to the source of the Suran river.\n\n==History==\n===Ancient history===\nThe  origins  of  Azka-Sur  are  lost  to history like many cities in Bulwar although it seems\nthat  Genie  rule  was never strong in the Upper Suran. According to Dwarven records, the\nDwarves of Seghdihr had established a small trade outpost called 'Logrod-Tungr', the River\nHarbor,  on  the  site that would become the Fortress of the Sun, but it is not established if\nthe  local  Human  tribes  were  organized. The bond between the Citrine Dwarves and the\nSurani people dates from these times and has never faltered throughout the centuries.\n\nAzka-Sur  is  first  mentioned  in  Bulwari  texts  during  the God-Kings Era but it does not\nappear  as  an important settlement and was only known as the 'Mountain-Fortress'. It was\nonly  following the establishment of the Bulwari Sun Cult around the tenth century BA that\nthe  city  became  a strong religious centre and became known as the Fortress of the Sun. It\nwas  nonetheless  never  the centre of an independent kingdom, the kings of Hašr becoming\nthe  main  power  of  the  Upper Suran following the demise of the Gnoll kingdoms. Trade\nwith  Rahen  made  the  city  rich  and  a  target for Gnoll packs who inhabited the Salahad\ndesert.  The  Djinn  sultanates helped the Gnolls defeat the Surani and sack the city in 228\nBA. The area would be controlled by gnolls until the Ashen Skies.\n\n===The first kingdom of Azka-Sur (178-1033)===\nSurprisingly,  it was the Harimraj conquest that strenghtened Azka-Sur. In 155 AA, Raheni\nsoldiers   crossed   the   Salahad  and  took  the  city,  making  it  the  new  centre  of  their\nprotectorate  over  Eastern  Bulwar.  While  their  conquest  was short-lived, the noble that\nthrew  them  out  in  178  kept  the Raheni kingdom and administration mostly intact. The\nRaheni  influence  was  strenghtened  by  the  events  of  321 when an exiled human prince\nnamed  Baji  arrived  in  Azka-Sur  after  his  defeat  in  battle against the Harimraj as they\nslowly  worked  on  creating  the caste system. His war elephants and veteran soldiers were\nwelcomed  by  the  local  king, who saw this as an opportunity. He married his daughter to\nhim  and  the  prince  converted  to the Sun Cult, changing his name to Barid szel-Sur. He\nthen joined the Bulwaris in the Great Revolt, eventually establishing control over the entire\nregion,  human  and  gnoll  alike  forging the new realm of Suranšes. While his heirs never\ncould  keep  his kingdom intact, Azka-Sur remained the primary power of the Upper Suran\nand  Salahad  until  the  campaigns  of  Aakhet the Bronze in 448 saw the kingdom divided\nbetween various princedoms."

The  death  of  Jaher  and the return of the Sun Legions only strenghtened this\ntrend.\nIn  the  Decades  that  followed  the  splintering of the Phoenix Empire, a veteran from the\nRaheni  campaign,  Carodir  became  the  Akal  of  Azka-Sur  and  established  the Surzuir\ndynasty.  While  one  of  the weakest Akalates, its relative isolation from the rest of Bulwar\nalong  with  a  generally  cordial  relationship  with the Desert legions allowed Azka-Sur to\nenjoy   a  relative  degree  of  independence,  often  threatened  by  its  strong  neighbor  in\nSareyand.\n\n==Places of interest==\nAzka-Sur  is  known  for  its  huge religious complexes, the main one being the Confluence\ntemple  which sits where the Golden Suran joins with the Brown Suran, a place considered\nholy  by  many  of  the Bulwari for it is the Suran river that brings life and prosperity to the\nregion. Following the conquest of Azka-Sur by the Jaddari, it became the centre of the Jadd\npriesthood."

 page_events.24.d: "\nThe kingdom of Dasmazar, also called Dasmatuš, is an island nation in the Gulf of Rahen,\noff the northern coast of Sarhal. It is the last stronghold of the Maqeti people.\n\n==History==\n\n=== Origin ===\nIn  916  AA,  a  human  Bulwari  slave  named  Maqet  led an uprising against his gnollish\noppressors.  The  rebellion  was  initially successful, but by 926 the gnolls had turned their\nfull  military  force on it and begun crushing it. Most of the slaves fled southeast across the\nSalahad Desert, led by Maqet's son Dasma and aided by the Mašnsih nomads.\n\nIn  930,  Dasma  finally  reached  the  coast of the Gulf of Rahen. There were gnolls living\nthere,  but  he  led  his  people  to  attack  and  massacre  them, then freed the local slaves.\nDasma  organized  the  people  into  a  kingdom,  which  he  named  Dasmazar  (“Dasma’s\nParadise”). His people renamed themselves the Maqeti, and the family szal-Maqet ("blood\nof Maqet") still rules the nation to this day.\n\n=== Fall of the kingdom ===\nDasmazar enjoyed relative peace for some decades due to the natural barrier of the Salahad\ndesert.  However,  in  the  11th  century,  Jaher’s conquests drove the gnolls out of Bulwar.\nMany  went  south  and  attacked  Dasmazar.  In  1047, Dasmazar sent ambassadors to ask\nJaher  for  help  and the elf pledged his aid. However, Jaher never delivered on his promise\nbefore  dying  in  1127.  With the subsequent fracturing of the Phoenix Empire, Dasmazar\nhad to stand alone.\n\nAfter  centuries  of  conflict,  the  gnolls  finally  overwhelmed  Dasmazar  in  1432.  Most\nMaqetis  were  re-enslaved  on  farming  plantations  in  the  ruins of their kingdom. Some\nmanaged  to  sail  to  the  island of Dasmatuš (“Dasma’s Rest”) using ships provided by the\nRaheni nation of Sarkhashabid. In exchange, Sarkhashabid received the island of Subkaliss,\nwhich the Maqetis had settled after it was abandoned in the 815 destruction of Edesukeru."

Despite this defeat, they\nconsider  their society a continuation of the old kingdom, and themselves the rightful rulers\nof their old mainland territory.\n\nDasmatuš  maintains  a  relatively  large  naval  fleet  as a deterrent against gnollish attack.\nThey  regularly  raid  gnollish  ships  in  order  to  liberate  slaves  and  take  resources. In\naddition,  they  train an elite unit of amphibious infantry, the Maqet Gumar (“Followers of\nMaqet”), who specialize in boarding raids.\n\nDespite  being  ruled  by  an  autocratic  monarchy, Dasmatis pride themselves on being an\negalitarian  country  where everyone descends from slaves and anyone can become a noble.\nThey  are  beloved  by the peoples enslaved by the gnolls, and they are known as tough and\nresilient folk.\n\n==Geography==\nDasmazar  proper  was located on the southwest coast of the Gulf of Rahen. The area has a\nhot,  semi-arid  climate, but is more fertile and hospitable than the deserts to the north and\nwest  due  to  the  moderating  influence of cold air currents coming off the ocean. Incense\nplants, spices and coffee beans are all grown here.\n\nThe  land  is  very  flat  and  sandy in the west, and more sparsely inhabited. Going east we\ncome  across  a  sudden  mountain,  called Maqetšad ("Maqet's Mountain") by the Maqeti\nand  Xhogrix  ("Red  Mountain")  by  the  gnolls, which is the source of several rivers that\nflow  through the area. The richest land is found around this mountain and it was the heart\nof  the  old  kingdom. After that there is a somewhat hilly region with middling soil, before\nwe reach the eastern end of the Maqeti domain and the vast savanna beyond.\n\nThe  island  of  Dasmatuš  is actually two small islands, one larger than the other, however\nthey  are  generally  referred  to  together.  It  too  is  relatively  fertile,  especially  for  the\ncultivation  of  spice  plants. In the centre of the larger island is a sacred mausoleum where\nthe Maqeti bury their kings and queens."

Its location was adjacent to the mountains of the Šad Sur and the Dasma river.\n\n==History==\nZanšap  was  a  remnant  of  the Šadnatu Akalate, which was founded after the Šad Sur was\nconquered  in  the  late  5th century by a former Aakhetian commander named Barseen. In\nthe  following centuries, the small mountainous Akalate became richer and richer thanks to\nthe  gold  mine in Šad Uraš and the slave trade, until most of it fell in the early 9th century\nto a gnollish invasion led by Jix the Goldseeker.\n\nAfter  Jaher’s  landing  in  1001, the Akal of the Šadnatu Kingdom, Bavar III, submitted to\nhim  under  the  condition  that  the  Sun  Elves  would help him take back the lands of his\nancestors.  The  promise  was fulfilled in 1004 when the gnolls were completely driven out\nof the Šad Sur and Bavar was named governor of the area.\n\nAfter  the  fall  of  the  Phoenix  Empire,  the Akalate became independent again but barely\nparticipated in the Cinder Wars, too occupied with the constant gnollish raids.\n\nMultiple gnollish invasions in the 13th and 14th centuries almost completely destroyed the\nakalate.  The  Šadnatu  people  retreated  to  the  city  of  Zanšap, sought protection by the\nKingom of Irrliam and became a vassal state.\n\n==Culture and Politics==\nMost  of  the  people of Zanšap were used to living in harsh mountainous environments but\nsince  adapted to the lifestyle of the western Suran plain. For the duration of the Age of the\nPhoenix, they were always extremely loyal to Jaher and the sun elves in general after getting\ntheir land back.\n\n===The Order of the Zenith===\nThe  Order  of  the  Zenith was an elite religious order composed of Zanšap’s best soldiers.\nUnlike  most,  however,  they  didn’t  answer  to  the temple or the Council, but directly to\nTaelarios  Irrliazuir,  the  sun  elf  who  unified the sun cult after Jaher’s death. Their main\nmission  was  to  track  and  deal  with the heretics that refused to believe that the Saviour’s\ndivinity  passed  onto the sun elves or who outright rejected Him. Their second, unofficial,\nmission was to ‘convince’ the other Sun Cult leaders to fall back in line behind Taelarios."

 page_events.1645.d: "\n\n===The Umaslu===\nDuring the last month before the winter solstice, when sunset draws near, the mountains of\nthe  Šad  Sur  cast  a  shadow  on  the  hill  adjacent  to  the  city of Zanšap that very much\nresembles  a  sheep.  During  these shorter days, the Zanšapi tended to respect the tenets of\nthe  Sun  Cult  to  the  letter to support Surael in his fight against Darkness. The day of the\nsolstice  was  called  ‘Umaslu’  or  ‘the  day of the sheep’ and families gathered around a big\nplate  of  ovine  meat before praying for the return of longer days. The practice latter spread\nto  other  parts  of Bulwar during the 16th and 17th centuries and is now practiced by most\nfollowers of the Sun Cults.\n\n==Notable Locations==\n===The Ekluzagnu===\nEkluzagnu,  also  known as Grixekyr in gnollish, was the capital of the Šadnatu Akalate. Its\nname,  roughly  translated  to “stone palace”, was not an exaggeration: the city was literally\ncarved  into  the  mountain.  Initially an ancient Bulwari fortress, it was transformed into a\ncapital by the gnollish matriarch Zehia, destroyed by the Xhazobine, partially rebuilt under\nthe  rule  of  Castan  III and destroyed again by Aakhet. When Barseen took control of the\nplace,  it was little more than a pile of ruins. His son Bavar I, with his Akalate flourishing,\nordered  the  restoration  of  the old fortress and turned it into a palace. As the excavations\ncontinued  and  more  of  the  ruins were uncovered, the palace became a town, then a city,\nuntil it officially became the capital in the year 542.\n\n==Foods and Dishes==\n===The Kasiyaru===\nThe  kasiyaru  is  a plant that only grows in the area around the city of Zanšap. Though the\nlocals have always credited this to Surael’s blessing, more modern botanists think it is likely\ndue  to  a  unique combination of rich soil brought by the numerous rivers flowing through\nthe  province,  high  exposure  to the sun and the mountains’ protection from the dry desert\nwinds. The seeds of the plant, once ground, produce one of the most exquisite spices in the\nworld  and  the  flowers  are  gifted  to  young  men  and women on the day they reach their\nseventeenth birthday to celebrate their entry into adulthood. The cultivation of the kasiyaru\nwas  so  important  to  the  Zanšapi  economy  and  culture  that it has long been one of its\nprimary symbols, and even featured on the Akalate’s flag."

The  later  addition  of  Salla  Ayeth's  aid  and  support convinced a frustrated\nOubblig  to  abandon  his  ambition to secure the entirety of the Bone Grove. The warlock\nleft further fighting to his lieutenants while he turned his ambitions elsewhere.\n\nSoon  after  the worst had passed, Alara would learn that Arun Drennen had died alongside\n''Ceann''  Celadil  Drennen  at  the  hands of the orcs. The news came as little comfort for\nAlara  who  would  stoically spend the ensuing years largely on the battlefield defending her\nclan against further incursion.\n\n=== Conclave of Elynáile ===\nBy  the  time  of  the  Conclave of Elynáile, Salla Cenág and Alara had slowly been making\nprogress  against  the  goblins  after  Oubblig's  death  and  the  break up of Oubbligsband.\nUnfortunately,  it was also about this time that Sapchopper would return and set her efforts\nback  and  force  her  war-weary  clan  back  on  the defensive. When messengers from her\ncousin  Narawen  Drennen  arrived  bearing  news  of  a  conclave  of  all  the  clans, Alara\nadamantly  refused the invitation. Both the sin of Salla Drennen hosting Arun Drennen and\nthe  grief  from  her  two  brothers'  deaths caused directly and indirectly by Arun Drennen\nwere  still  fresh  in  Alara's  mind  even  after the many years. This stubborn refusal would\nchange  to grudging agreement after a bitter argument with Lanhara that the conclave could\nsecure Salla Cenág's survival."

Alara, for her part, took every opportunity\nto  squabble  with  Narawen  despite  the  Drennen  ''Ceanna'' being as accommodating as\npossible.  This  routine  would  continue until the conclave was interrupted by the wayward\nhuman  Corin and her party of followers who had come seeking aid against what she called\nthe  true  Greentide.  Corin's  plea  fell  on deaf ears and guards were ordered to arrest the\nparty.  However,  as  a  scuffle was about to break out, Arun Drennen revealed himself and\naided  in Corin's escape. Furious that Arun still lived, Alara declared her involvement with\nthe conclave over and left to hunt her traitorous grand-uncle down.\n\nAlara's  hunt  would end before it began when Narawen revealed she knew where Arun was\nlater  that  night.  Mistrustful of her cousin, Alara nevertheless followed. True to her word,\nNarawen  led  to  where  Arun,  Corin,  and the rest were hiding. Before Alara could strike\nArun down, her grand-uncle revealed the truth about the Verdant Veil and how her younger\nbrother  Eledas  died  due  to  an ancient archfey known as the Eldest. Arun then explained\nthat  only  Corin,  as  an  avatar  of  a  god,  could  avenge  Eledas and free the elves of the\nVerdant  Veil  by  striking  down  the Eldest. The collective revelations come as a shock to\nAlara. But, by the end of the night, she agrees to work with Narawen to allow Corin, Arun,\nand the rest safe passage in the hopes of avenging Eledas.\n\n=== Verdant Pact ===\nReconciled  with  Narawen,  Alara became a fervent supporter of the Verdant Pact much to\nthe  surprise  of  the  other  clans.  While  her actual role in leading the conclave would be\nminor,  her role as a symbol was far more significant. For the various Ceanns and Ceannas\npresent,  she  represented  the  possibility  that no matter what the past was, the clans could\nmake amends with each other and form a united front.\n\n== Relationships ==\n"

It  was  said  that  when news of Arun's apparent death\nreached  her,  Alara  shed no tears, at least publicly, but showed bitter relief. It wasn't until\nthe  Conclave  of  Elynáile  that two would reconcile. Unfortunately, that would also be the\nlast time they ever saw each other alive as Arun would die in the fight with the Eldest.\n\n=== Narawen Drennen ===\nBorn  several  decades  apart,  Alara  and  Narawen  were  not particularly close before the\nConclave  of  Elynáile, with the two cousins only interacting on rare occasion.

However, after meeting Arun and reconciling with him thanks\nto Narawen's intervention, Alara's attitude toward her cousin abruptly changed.

One  such  claim  to fame is its former Prahbi Goshar\nGoldenpaw,  who  prevented  the  dissolution  of  the newly reformed Harimraj in 1333 by\ntaking  charge  as  the  first  unofficial  Grand  Vizier  of the realm and acting regent of the\nrealm   during   Shurapalar's   youth.

For over 70 years since Goshar's end\nin  1358  the  Phrabi  enjoyed  the  position  of  Grand  Vizier  in  the  Raj, codifying it in\nAmanpurna II's Settlement and Edict of 1396, becoming second only to the Raja themself.\n\nThis  would  come to an end in 1438 with the elevation of Manava of the Bloody Claw, the\nSenapti  of  Rabhidaraj, to Grand Vizier of the Raj. The lords of Amtujsaat, viewing this as\nan  insult  to their family, did not take this lightly. This passive hostility grew until Manava\ndied  in  1478  and  his  daughter  Indira succeeded him in an unprecedented elevation of a\nwoman  to  Grand  Vizier.  Igniting  the  tensions,  this  elevation sparked The Wars of the\nVizierate,  raging  intermittently  from  1481  to 1505. Though Amtujsaat would come out\nvictorious, through the fighting they would lose their independence.

For the state, see Free City of Anbenncóst''\n\nAnbenncóst  is  a  city on the Isle of Damesear, it is known as the center of civilization and\nlargest  city  in  the  known  world.  The  city is a melting pot of cultures from Cannor and\nbeyond  and  the  very  heart of what makes Anbennar. The Damesk River cuts through the\ncity.   By   the   19th  century,  Anbenncóst's  urban  sprawl  had  spread  itself  throughout\nDamesear  that  the lines between were incredibly blurred - especially between Anbenncóst\nand Old Damenath, which eventually eventually was absorbed into the city.\n\n==History==\n=== Damerian Republic ===\nWhile  the  isle  of  Damesear was the center of the ancient Damerian Republic, the city of\nDamenath  was  its  capital,  due  to  its  location facing the Dameshead where much of the\nantiquity civilizations had their trading centres.\n\nDue  to  this  what  is now known as Anbenncóst was then Damucen, a southern port-town\nthat  handled  trade  with the Divenhal Sea if ships were unable or unwilling to cross to the\nother  side  of  the  Damesear.  Damucen was also famous for its colosseum (known as the\nOld Colosseum) which profited greatly due to the influx of slaves from across the Diven.\n\n===Post-Dragonwake===\nThe  Dragonwake  resulted  in the Razing of Damenath where much of the ancient city was\nburned by Zaamalot the Black which then caused the Fall of the Damerian Republic. After\nthe  attack many refugees found their way to Damucen which would then become the major\nurban center for the island.\n\nIn 773, during the years of Carneter-Dameria, king Lorenan II/I granted his nephew Rogec\nRubentis  a  County  of  Damucen  comprised of the ancient city limits and its surrounding\nareas.  Count  Rogec  then  founded  House  Dameris and built the original keep of Castle\nDameris, which would become the seat of the kings of Dameria 125 years later."

However what it did\nhave  was  ample space and prime location, which turned the lands outside Damucen into a\nlarge  tent-city  where  the  liberation efforts of the League of Free Realms were rallied and\norganized  during  the  War  of  the  Sorcerer-King.

 page_events.69.t: "Ancient Bulwar 1 / 4"
 page_events.69.d: "\nAncient  Bulwar  describes  the  history  of  Bulwar  from  around  2800  BA  to the fall of\nKarqašlu  in  1134 BA. It is in this time that we see the rise of Bulwari civilisation and the\nappearance  of  the  first God-Kings of Bulwar and the first invasion through Invader's Pass\nfrom  the  Forbidden  Plains.  It  also  sees  the  downfall of both, setting up Bulwar's state\nduring the Age of Antiquity.\n\n== The God-Kings ==\nIn its early age Bulwar is the first known human civilization to rise up. It can reasonably be\nstated  that  after  centuries  of  serving  the  Djinn,  the  Bulwari  tribes  had learned some\nstructure  and  hierarchy  from  their  genie  overlords.  Of  course the role that Brasan the\nEmancipator  played  cannot  be  overstated.  The  art  of  genie-binding  must  have been a\ncentral      characteristic      of      ancient      Bulwari      power     structures.     Surviving\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stele   steles]   proclaim   the   chiefs   of   this   period   as\n‘God-Kings’  and depict them performing many feats that the mages of today confirm could\nbe  achieved  with  the  aid  of  genies.  Presumably after the banishment of the Djinn from\nBulwar,  these  new  powerful  genie-binders  used  the  existing  power-structure  to  place\nthemselves  in  the  seats  of  the  Djinn.  This saw the expansion of old Djinn sites and the\nconstruction of new palaces. There may have at one point been hundreds of God-Kings, all\nwith  their own palace. Several of the most successful of these God-Kings saw their palaces\nexpand  into  the  first  Bulwari  city-states. The Ancient cities of Bulwar, Brasan, Azkabar,\nAzka-Szel-Azka and Eduz-Vacyn are some that remain today.\n\nLittle  is  known  about  the actual nature of these early magi. The genie-binders must have\nbeen  immensely  powerful  if  the  steles are to be believed. However despite their magical\nprowess  they  still  used  armies  to resolve their issues. Bronze spear tips, arrowheads and\nsword  blades  have  been found embedded in old riverbeds of the Suran and dated to times\nranging as far back as the 23rd century BA.\n\nSome  of  these  appear  to have been from dwarven make. It is likely that they traded with\nthe  dwarves  from Seghdihr and Shazstundihr. Especially that last hold appears to have had\na  great  influence  on  early  Bulwari architecture. Its marble statuary and construction has\nbeen  found  adorning  the  palaces  of  ancient  God-Kings.  Some  of  this  looks to be of\ndwarven  make,  but  much  of  this  is  an  imitation  of  dwarven  architecture  or of genie\narchitecture  using  techniques  similar  to  those  seen  in  Shazstundihr.  This  agrees with\nrecords  of  dwarves  from  that  hold  teaching Bulwari humans the arts of architecture and\nsculpture.  Indeed,  the  Bulwari-Dwarven  relations  appear  to have been good, or at least\ncooperative,  during  this  time  -  with  the  hold  of  Ovdal  Tûngr  seeing  restoration and\nresettlement  by  the  dwarves  as  a  vassal  under  the God-King Irsakar the Benevolent of\nBarzišah in the late 22nd century."

 page_events.1663.d: "\n\n== The Decline of the God-Kings ==\nSeveral theories on the decline of the God-Kings exist. Some scholars think there may have\nbeen  a  great  war,  while  others say that perhaps the Dwarves or Precursor Elves may have\nhad a hand in their decline. We do see a decrease in activity in many of the old palace sites\nthroughout  Bulwar,  this  suggests  a  gradual  disappearance  of  the  God-Kings and their\ncity-states.  This  has  led  to  the  belief that the genie-binders came to jealously guard the\nsecrets  to their craft. This may have over time have meant that the group of God-Kings got\nsmaller and more powerful, while some aspects of the art was lost. By the 16th century BA\nthe   art   of   genie-binding   must   have  disappeared  to  such  a  degree  that  it  allowed\nproto-Zabatlari  nomads to invade Bulwar through a pass in the Serpentspine and subjugate\nthe city-states of the region in 1537 BA. That pass has been named Invader’s Pass until this\nday.\n\nA  tale recorded by Himmet of Akalšes during the time that the Damerian Republic owned\nmuch  of  Bulwar puts this change into a more mythological setting. While the tale itself is\ntoo long to record here and not all of it has survived, the general gist of it is as follows:\n\n''“In  those days, Bulwar was ruled by many God-Kings. These men and women had bound\nthe  Genies  to  their  will  and  used  them  as  their servants. The Genies would grant the\nGod-Kings  whatever  they  wished.  Many  great deeds were done and many terrible things\nwere  wrought  with  this  power.  In  time  the God-Kings became jealous of one another’s\npower  and  they  began  to  squabble.  One  destroyed  the  other’s palace with a sentence.\nWhole  cities  disappeared through malicious or careless wishes. The most careless wish of\nall was the final wish uttered by any of the God-Kings: God-King Amussu “The Speaker of\nthe Sky” wished that he would be the only one to have the power of the Wish. The next day\nhe  started receiving reports of an invasion of a horde that had come down from beyond the\nSerpentspine.  His  rivals  had  all  fallen  one  by one, their host seemingly immune to the\nmagic  of  the  bound  genies. He was the last remaining God-King of Bulwar. However he\ncould  not  rejoice.  Because  he  did  not  have  the time to bind another Genie to his will\nbefore the enemy stormed his palace. But when he tried to utter his last wish, he found that\nhe  was  mute.  He  retained the power of the Wish, but he was unable to use it. When the\nenemy found him, they tried to kill him, but he simply would not die. His wish had bound\nhim  to  life.  Forever  living with the power of the Wish, but never being able to utter one\never  again.  The  new  rulers  of Bulwar buried him alive at the edge of the Salahad desert,\nwhere he remains until this day.”''"

 page_events.1664.d: "\n\n== The Karqašlu Empire ==\nWhile  the  exact  nature  of  the  decline  of  the  God-Kings  is uncertain, the conquest of\nBulwar  by  a  group  of  nomads from the Forbidden plains is. This First Invasion in 1537\nBA  swept  over  the  city-states  and  united  them  into  one  large empire. At its height it\nspanned  from  Azka-Szel-Azka all the way to Azka-Sur. Art of the genie-binders disappears\nand instead we see reliefs and statues of great horse-riding warriors. Often they are jousting\nor  hunting. Little written records of this time have survived to modern times. However we\ndo find evidence of a great palatial site near Kumarkand from this period. This presumably\nwas  the  city  of Karqašlu, which was the capital of this empire of horse lords. The site has\nmany stables and storehouses which does reinforce that theory. The empire lasted for about\n400  years  until  it  fell  during  the  Onslaught, but it peaked early on. Kheteratan records\nmention  a  war  in  1469  BA  between  Elikhet  the  Wanderer and a Karqašlu king called\nAlušir  over  the  domination  of  the Divenhal. Elikhet claimed victory and several coastal\ncities,  most  notably  Brasan,  became  subjects  of  Kheterata.  Shortly after this they also\nappear to have lost control over Bahar. Azka-Szel-Azka has evidence of royal occupation in\nthe 15th and 14th centuries BA.\n\nWhile  the  empire  declined  in  geographical  scope, the 14th century BA was a period of\nprosperity  along the Suran and Baranun plains. An architectural revival crosses the region,\nwith  many  cities being expanded and renovated. Additionally the first trade networks with\nRahen  appear,  exchanging  goods such as spices, pottery and metalwork. During this time\nthe first Bulwar Canal was dug as a connection between the Suran and Baranun rivers.\n\n== The Onslaught ==\nStarting  around  the  turn  of  the  12th  century BA people start to disappear from coastal\ntowns  and  villages everywhere along the Divenhal. Then, moving from west to east, entire\nsettlements  disappear.  Kheterata’s colonies are hit first. Akasik, then Deshak, Busirat and\nTefkora.  Records  are  disjointed  but  they  speak of creatures that come from the sea and\nburn down villages and towns. They capture as many people as possible and then disappear\nwith  them.  Those  taken were never seen again. In 1191 BA Azka-Szel-Azka was the first\nmajor  Bulwari city to be hit by the attack. Thiren the Younger, a Castanorian scholar from\nthe  time  of  Castan  Beastbane, tells us that the fortress was well prepared. It’s thick walls\nwould  withstand any siege and its food supplies had been well-stocked, even though at that\nmoment  it housed the majority of the population of Bahar. But the ‘Deep Devils’ snuck in\nthrough  the  sewer  system  at  night.  It wasn’t until a year later that the fortress was found\nquiet, its entire population slaughtered."

 page_events.1665.d: "\n\nBut  the  slaughter  of  Azka-Szel-Azka  was  only the start. Over the next fifty years similar\nevents  would  occur  at  other  locations  all  along  the coasts of the Divenhal. Brasan, for\nexample,  was  razed in 1185 BA, leaving the city desolate for decades. The coastal regions\nof  Bulwar  quickly  became  depopulated  with  only  a  few  daring or stubborn fishermen\nremaining in their villages. But inland was not entirely safe either, as on occasions it seems\nraids happened along the Suran as far upstream as Kalib. These inland raids appear to have\nbeen the final nail in the coffin of the Karqašlu Empire.\n\nThiren  the  Younger  describes how their king, Batur II, gathered an army in 1139 BA, 40\nyears  after the razing of Brasan. He marched his army down the Suran and set up camp by\nthe  ruins  of  Brasan, telling his army to prepare for battle whenever it may come. That the\nclouds  were  heavy  and the moon was hidden behind shadow. King Batur was asleep when\nthe  first  attacks  came  and  were  repelled by his night guard and their palisade, but great\ndamage  had  been  done to their forward defenses. By the time the second attack came the\nking  was  awake  and  leading  the defense. This time they came in greater force, however.\nThe  palisades  gave way and the forward defenses were swarmed, soldiers couldn’t see what\nthey were fighting, but they were terrified. Amidst the chaos the king was wounded and had\nto  retreat.  Finally  his magi, mere apprentice students of the god kings of old, managed to\nturn  the  tide  with spells of blinding light, causing their attackers to retreat. The army was\ngreatly  diminished  and their situation looked dire. So they gathered around the king’s tent\nand  prepared their final stand. Somehow they held out. When the first rays of the morning\nsun  lit  the battlefield only the king and a dozen men remained as the devils fled before the\nlight.  Batur II would be the last king of Karqašlu. Shortly after his return to the capital he\ndied  of  his  wounds  and the empire died with him. There was a crisis and a civil war and\nfive  years  after  this  Battle of Brasan, the attacks of the sea devils stopped. The same year\nthe last son of Batur II perished in battle against the newly established Harpy Queendom in\nthe  mountainous  regions of northern Bulwar. That year marks the end of Ancient Bulwar:\n1134 BA.\n"

Humans  often  tend  to  value  the history and cultural status of a relic more\nthan most other races.\n\n=== Dwarven ===\nDevices  and  items from ancient Aul-Dwarov, the Segbandal, or the Jade Mines. Dwarven\nrelics  and  artifacts  are  largely  mechanical  in  nature,  although  items infused with rune\nmagic  are not unheard of, and many have been found as trade items.

Ruled by the Appleseed family, it was infamous for its feud with\nits northern neighbor Pearview.\n\n==History==\nThe  lands  that  would  become Appleton were part of the Small Province of the Gnomish\nHierarchy.  The  titular  settlement  prospered as a trading center thanks to its proximity to\nboth  the  Burroy  and  the  Middanroy  rivers.  When  the Dragonwake saw most gnomish\nadministrators  and  soldiers pulled away to defend against the Kobold Rising, their halfling\nsubjects  were  left  to  fend  for themselves against the Gawedi invasion of Lencenor. They\nwould  unite under the Small Kingdom as part of the western province of Ciderfield (along\nwith Pearview), eventually repelling the Alenics.\n\nThe  Era  of Black Ice would bring great changes to Appleton. The Appleseed family was a\ncadet  branch of the Ciderfield ruling family, as was the Peartree family; when the mainline\nfamily  died  out,  the  two  sides feuded over the succession, starting the Cider Feud which\nwould dominate Appleton's politics for multiple centuries. Following the foundation of the\nKingdom  of  Reveria,  the  halflings  found a friendly neighbor from whom they could hire\nreliable mercenaries for war and sturdy farmhands and laborers in peacetime.\n\nThe  War of the Sorcerer-King would see Appleton's ally Lorent extend a protectorate over\nthe Small Country in the aftermath of the Third Tall War. Castanor invaded soon after, the\nfrontlines  pushing  back  and  forth across the duchy. The Castanorians suffered a defeat at\nthe  Battle  of  Appleton,  delaying  plans  for  a  push into south. Nevertheless, it would be\noccupied  after  the  Beepeck  river  defenses  were  overrun  once  more  and would not be\nliberated until 1007. Appleton was granted independence in the Treaty of Anbenncóst.\n\nThe  Cider  Feud  would  flare  up  a  number  of  times  over  the following centuries with\nAppleton  launching  raids across the Burroy River, usually attempting to seize Newcobble.\nTheir successes are owed to the adoption of pony cavalry tactics by the border skirmishers.\nLorent and Gawed would take advantage of this conflict as proxy wars for their own rivalry,\nleading  to  to  the  secession  of  Appleton's  rich western county of Cowskeep to form the\nneutral Turnwell League with Butterburn."

The duchy refused to participate in the failed\nViswall Rebellion and thus was spared annexation for a time.\n\nIt  would later become part of the Small Country following the Small Country Rebellion in\nthe  mid-1500s.

This\npride  extends  to  the national drink, apple cider, which is consumed more frequently than\nale in the duchy.\n\nAppletoners  think of themselves as a reliable and honest sort of people. This is in part due\nto  the  stability  of  their national bank and their mercantile economy keeping coin flowing\nthrough  Appleton, allowing even the smallest farming families to sustain themselves. Their\nrivalry  with  Pearviewers continues, seeing the halflings across the river as impolite, crude,\nand dishonest "bad apples".\n\n"

Despite being created as a result of the same tragedy, the many\nminds  that make up the Fused Monarchs are not always in agreement, and their whims can\nbe  fickle.

With the\nappearance  of  a giant moth, the Herald is often the first envoy of war sent by the Unseelie\nCourt  and is known to be an unparalleled master of change and metamorphosis. The fey is\ncapricious,  often  changing  things  at  will,  and is known for its nearly irreversible curses,\nwhich have led to the creation of many warped and strange creatures in the Deepwoods.\n\nThe  powers  of  the  Herald  of  Change  become  increasingly  uncontrollable  as it grows\nstronger, and it is not uncommon for everything around it to become warped and distorted.\nTo  combat  this,  the  Herald  must  periodically be reborn from a cocoon in the Unseelie\nCourt.  Despite  its  fearsome  reputation,  the Herald of Change remains a fascinating and\nmysterious  figure  in the world of the fey, and those who study the creatures and powers of\nthe  Unseelie  Court cannot help but be intrigued by its power and abilities. Those who are\nwilling  to  accept the consequences of change and willing to take risks for the greater cause\nwould seek a pact with the Herald of Change.\n\n===The Trader of Masks and Faces===\nThe  Trader  of  Masks  and  Faces  is  an  enigmatic  and  elusive  archfey,  known  for  its\ncollection  of  identities  and  its  habit  of  roaming  between  different realms. Despite its\nassociation  with  the  Unseelie  Court, the Trader of Masks and Faces is rarely seen there,\ninstead preferring to wander and collect identities from various places. During these travels\nit  is  said  that  the  Trader never wears the same face twice, leaving their true form, if they\neven have one, a mystery."

In exchange for lending out an identity, the Trader always demands an identity\nin return.\n\nMortals who wish for a new identity or those who are seeking a powerful and unpredictable\nally  might  seek  a  pact  with the Trader of Masks and Faces. Those who are desperate, in\ntrouble, or wish to escape their current circumstances might also turn to the Trader, as they\nmay  be  willing  to  offer  their old identity in exchange for a new one. However, making a\npact  with  the  Trader  is  not  without risk, as they expect the benefactor to fully own their\nnew  identity  and  prove  themselves worthy of it. What that means is wholly in the eyes of\nthe Trader.\n\n==Archfey of the Seasonal Courts==\n===The Drag of The Waves===\n\nThe  Drag  of  the  Waves  (also  known  as  "the  Endless Ebb and Flow") is a mysterious\narchfey  that is associated with the Summer Court of Eordand. This powerful being is often\ndepicted  as  the ocean itself, a fickle force that both brings great bounty and takes in equal\nmeasure. Sailors of the ocean are said to appease this archfey, hoping to avoid its wrath and\nprotect  their  ships  from  being  lost  at  sea.  Indeed,  it  is  often credited with lifting the\ndoldrums  on  the  open  ocean  and  bringing  fresh  wind  to  those who are stuck in calm\nwaters.\n\nSome  druids  of  the  Summer  Court  even believe that the Drag of the Waves created the\nCaamasi  by luring Ealar the Mariner into the open seas and that it was this same force that\ncaused Ealar to leave and explore the world.\n\nOf  course,  the Drag of the Waves is not simply a force. As an archfey, it is well known to\ncommune  with  mortals.  Those  who  have  described the experience as though it was like\nbeing  in  the  midst  of  the  ocean,  with  powerful  force  pushing  and  pulling you in all\ndirections.  They  continue  by explaining that you either learn to understand and flow with\nthe current or drown under the pressure."

Those few who have\nencountered  him  in the flesh describe him as a frozen, elf-like humanoid, with pure white\nskin,  long, icy blue hair, blindingly bright blue eyes, and a cold, fatalistic demeanor that is\nreminiscent of the power of winter itself.\n\nThe  Everfrost  Prince  is  rumored  to  have a special connection to the cold, and is said to\nhave  the  ability to bestow immense power over winter upon those who seek his patronage.\nThis  power  is  not  given  lightly,  however,  and  those  who  seek to forge a pact with the\nEverfrost  Prince  must be prepared to be bound to his will and his mysterious goals.

Despite  her  fall  from grace, she has not given up on her\ndesire  for  revenge  and a return to her former greatness. Her attentions have turned to the\nPeitar Eordan, who she sees as ripe targets for her machinations. She appeals to their sense\nof  superiority and feelings of betrayal, working tirelessly to manipulate and control them in\nher  quest  for  power.  As  a  patron  of  the  Eordand  Eordellon, the Unthroned Queen is\nshrouded  in mystery and rumors abound about the extent of her influence and the methods\nshe employs to achieve her goals."

Those who fail to support the cause or even\nshow  opposition  are  likely  to  incur  the wrath of the Blackened Prince.

Information on the archfey is scarce with almost\nall of it coming from the writings of Arun Drennen. Indeed the very term "the Eldest'' was\nnot  even  the archfey’s given name. It was simply Drennen’s attempt to describe the archfey\ndue to a lack of any other fitting term to describe their prestige and power among the Fey.\n\nUnfortunately, by the time Drennen had begun his writings, the exact personality and belief\nof the Eldest had long been lost. According to the Wood Elf, this was due to the creation of\nthe  Verdant  Veil.  By  invoking  the  exceedingly  powerful barrier and maintaining it, the\nEldest’s very essence and being had been sacrificed. What was left was nothing more than a\nferal husk determined to keep the Veil up.\n\nFrom  the  Day  of  the  Ashen Skies to the year 1443, what remained of the Eldest did just\nthat.  It  was  only  with  the  arrival  of  the  ascended  goddess  Corin, the goblin warlock\nOubblig, the elven mage Arun Drennen, and others that the Eldest’s existence came to end.\nSadly,  the  exact  events  surrounding  the  Eldest's death are shrouded in mystery. What is\nknown is that their death would leave a lasting impact on the Fey and the Verdant Veil.\n\n==Relations Between the Archfey==\nMuch  like  the  mortals  of  the Halann, the Archfey are very much divided and constantly\nwork  to  undermine  each  other's  schemes  and  goals.  Conflicts  between  them  are  as\ncommon  as  anywhere  on  Halann.  Yet,  where  they differ is that no archfey may directly\ninterfere  with  another  archfey.  This  tacit agreement is what fey scholars have roughly as\n“the Accord.”\n\nWhile  the  exact  details of “the Accord” continue to elude scholars, what is certain is that\nan archfey seeking to oppose another will always leverage another creature to do so, be they\nlesser fey or otherwise."

He  was  born  at  the  end  of  the  Castanorian  invasion  of  Eastern Dameshead.\nBecause  of  the  invasion his family would lose its small patch of land and would be forced\nto  flee  towards  the  court  of  Dameria.  His father thought the only way for the family to\nregain  its  status  was to fight in the war, because of that Arnulf and his brother Ulric were\nraised to become soldiers.\n\nWhen  Arnulfs  father  died  in  1012 he would gather the remaining funds of the family in\norder  to  create  the  Andhol company, a mercenary company.

When  the  battle  of  Calascandur  would  take  place  Arnulf Company was still\nlicking its wounds and was thus unable to participate in the battle.\n\nWhen  the  company  eventually  managed  to  recover  in  1015,  Arnulf  would  lead  the\nCompany  towards  already  liberated  Corvuria.

Indeed  such  was  the  intensity  of  this  resolve  that  eventually\nattracked  the  attention  of  his  young  grand-nephew  Eledas Cenág. Eledas, who was also\ngifted in magic, would go on to become Arun's apprentice.\n\nTogether, the two elves continued to push the boundaries of Wood Elven knowledge on the\nfey and Verdant Veil. Indeed, after over two decades working together, the mage duo found\nthe  source  of  the  Verdant  Veil:  the  Eldest.  Confident  freedom was in sight, Arun and\nEledas prepared a spell that would allow them to contact and meet the archfey.\n\nThe  attempt  was a disaster as the Eldest, who had long since lost its sentience maintaining\nthe  Verdant  Veil,  lashed  out  against  the  two elves. Eledas was killed and Arun was left\nbloody  and  amnesic.  When  ''Ceann'' Belarion Cenág found out of his younger brother's\ndeath,  the  dazed Arun was arrested. After failing to explain how Eledas' had died and with\nthe  evidence  pointing  to  Arun  being  the  cause,  Belarion  sentenced his grand-uncle to\nexecution for kin-slaying."

As Arun\ndespaired, the avatar Corin entered the Deepwoods.\n\nAs  the  human  avatar  made  her  way  through  the  woods  in  search  of  aid  against the\nGreentide,  Arun  soon  became aware of her powerful presence. Knowing she was the only\nchance  at success, he followed her to the city of Elynáile where a conclave was being held.\nIntervening  before  a  scuffle  between  Corin and the Wood Elf leaders could begin, Arun\nbegged to Corin for her aid. To his surprise, she quickly agreed.\n\nIn  order  to  secure  safe  passage  out  of  the  city, Arun then arranged a meeting with his\ngrand-niece  Narawen.  The  resulting  encounter  results  in  an  unexpected  meeting with\nArun's  other  niece  Alara. After explaining his plan and revealing the truth behind Eledas'\ndeath, the two ''Ceanna'' agreed to aid him, Corin, and her party to escape the city.\n\n==Death and Bringing Down the Verdant Veil==\nOutside  of  the  city,  the  party  would  end  up  meeting  the goblin warlock Oubblig and\naccepting  his  aid.  Then,  through  Arun's magic, they entered the Feyrealm to engage the\nEldest.  During  the  fight,  Arun  would sacrifice himself to allow Corin to land the killing\nblow  against  the  Eldest.  His body would then be returned to Elynáile where he would be\nmourned and celebrated as a hero."

Following his expulsion of the gnollish pack of Zagmarrk who inhabited the city\nof Raxaklu, Eledas built the residence on the ruins of a gnoll palace of Proxacha Eklu from\nthe  Age  of  Monsters,  deciding that it provided the perfect foundation for his own palace.\nBuilt  on  a  hilltop  overlooking the city, it served as an important administrative center to\nthe Sarelzuir governors of Sareyand.\n\n== The Burning of the Ash Palace ==\nDuring Jaher’s eastern campaigns in Haless, his 3 year old daughter Jexis remained behind,\nspending   her   early   years   growing  up  in  Bulwar.  Jaher  was  unable  to  oversee  the\nadministrative  needs  of  Bulwar at the time, and the governors appointed to rule in Jaher’s\nstead  sought  greater  political  power for themselves. Eledas I Sarelzuir was the appointed\nprotector of Jexis while Jaher was on campaign, and amidst this power struggle he sought to\nuse her as a political pawn to consolidate power for himself. Other governors grew worried\nand anxious, with some planning to even kill Jexis altogether.\n\n=== The Aftermath of the Burning ===\nAt  the  age  of  5,  the  palace was set on fire killing many. Jexis survived, however was left\nwith  scars  all  over  her face, which would lead to her only being seen in public wearing a\ngolden  mask. Following this, Elizar, Jexis' older half-brother, took on the responsibility of\nher  protection,  and  sought  revenge against those responsible. The governor of Setadazar,\nThelrion  Nestezuir,  was  suspected  by many to be the one responsible for the burning. At\nthe age of 18, following the death of Jaerel and the collapse of the eastern Phoenix Empire,\nJexis  seized  power and control of the remains of the empire, with Elizar as her right hand,\nwho  was  sent  to  subdue  and  destroy  her  opponents  who  did  not  submit to her rule.\nNotably, as an act of revenge for his alleged part in the burning of the palace, in 1137 Jexis\nsent  Elizar to lead an army to sack and loot the city of Setadazar. During this event, which\nwould  be  known  as  the  Slaughter  of  Setadazar,  Elizar ordered the killing of Thelrion’s\ninfant  son  before  his eyes, after which he was shackled and paraded through the streets of\nseveral  Bulwari  cities.  The  following year, Jexis instituted the first ban on human magic,\nfollowing  the  discovery  of  documents  that  linked  the  former governor with a group of\nBulwari magi who appeared to be the true reason behind the burning."

They coalesce around the\nideal  of restoring the Deepwoods to their prior extent, stretching through Escann and up to\nthe  White  Reach  as they did prior to Castanor's conquest of the region. While it remains\ndifficult  to  ascertain  if they constitute a specific organization, or are merely associated by\nideology,  the  fey who ascribe to the Ashentree Pact are scattered throughout the seelie and\nunseelie  courts  of  the  Deepwoods  alike,  and  seem to consider the Blackened Prince as\ntheir  leader.  They possess a marked disdain for humans that has allegedly been the source\nof many of the tragic accidents known to befall explorers and merchants in the Deepwoods.\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe  Ashentree  Fey  take  their  name  from  the World Tree, said to be a massive ash tree\nformerly  located  in  Oldhaven that served to more closely link Halann with the Feyrealm.\nThe  tree  was  lit  aflame  during  a  Castanorian  campaign  in the region, giving a second\nmeaning to the "Ashen" tree.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Origins ===\nIn  Cannor's  primordial  history,  the  region  now  known as Escann was dominated by an\nunbroken  forest  that  included  the Cursewood and Greatwoods, known as the Oldwoods.\nThe  whole  region  was dominated by fey creatures and their minions, including Centaurs,\nSatyrs,  Nymphs,  Hags,  and that have largely been driven to obscurity or extinction in the\nmodern  day.  The  region  was  centered  around  a  massive ash known as the World Tree,\nwhich is thought to have served as a political and religious center for the fey. Following the\nCastanite  Exodus,  the  humans  who  settled  the north and came to inhabit Cannor began\ngrand  campaigns  of conquest and deforestation, dedicated to wiping out the inhabitants of\nthe  region,  justifying their conquest through the claim that these creatures were the spawn\nof Agrados.\n"
 page_events.1687.t: "Ashentree Fey 2 / 3"
 page_events.1687.d: "\nDuring  a major campaign known as the Second Great Cleansing, a battle took place at the\nsite  of  the  tree  in  Oldhaven,  during  which  the  tree was set ablaze and reduced to ash,\nallegedly  by  the  hand  of  Castan  II  Beastbane.  The  burning  most  likely  occurred in\nTeysuren   of   580   BA,   according  to  Castanorian  sources.  This,  along  with  a  mass\nimpalement  of  Fey  on  the shores of Silent Lake in Ellyn Grove was likely the impetus of\nthe  Ashentree  Pact's  formation.  It  remains  difficult  to  ascertain if this spurred from a\npopular  movement  or  the actions of an unknown leader as no reliable information on the\nFey's  perspective  during  this period has surfaced amongst Cannor's scholars. However, it\nis  most  likely that the first fey to adopt the label of Ashentree joined together in their pact\nto restore the span of the Verdant Expanse shortly after these events.\n\n=== Goblins, Wood Elves and the Ashentree Pact ===\nThe   Ashentree  pact  appear  to  have  had  little,  if  any  influence  on  the  goblins  that\ntraditionally  inhabited  the Deepwoods before the arrival of the elves. Even the elves seem\nto  have had few interactions, with only rumors of the much-maligned Ghúl clan's dealings\nwith  them  standing  along  other  accusations of association with the unseelie fey, demons,\ncults, and all manner of malicious entites real and imagined. The most that can be dredged\nup  through extensive research is some murmurings that inhabitants of the Deepwoods have\nbeen offered bounties on the humans of Escann.\n\n=== Orcs and the Ashentree Pact ===\nThe  Ashentree  fey  had much more significant contact with orcs than their predecessors in\nthe  region, according to the oral histories that survived these poorly documented conflicts.\nIt  was  said,  when  one  of the numerous competing clans of orcs who had flowed into the\nDeepwoods  during the Greentide appeared to be achieving dominance over the others, the\nAshentree  fey  came  forward with an offer. A royal marriage, the clan's chieftan forming a\nunion  with  one  of their own in exchange for their vassalage, and, as they later discovered,\ntheir very souls. This group of orcs is identified by the name of Tugund-Darakhan, the clan\nof  a  thousand  trees.  It  is  said  that  the  power  of  the  fey  turned  these  orcs a sickly,\nunnaturally   bright  shade  of  green,  that  their  minds  and  words  grew  as  strange  and\ninscruitable as those of the fey. The ferocious strength of these "Emerald Orcs" supposedly\nnecessitated  one  of  the  few  instances  of  cooperation  between  the elves and orcs of the\nDeepwoods  to  crush this mysterious threat that seemed to wish nothing but death upon all\nthe mortals of Halann."

Perhaps the\nmost  significant  material contribution they appear to have produced is the regional variant\nof  the  common curse "Ashen skies!" uttered instead as "Ashen boughs!", most commonly\nheard   among   Wood   Elves,   but  present  in  the  tongues  of  most  inhabitants  of  the\nDeepwoods.\n\n== Beliefs ==\nThe  Ashentree  Fey  is  a  group  united  by  common desire to avenge humans for burning\nWorld  Tree,  held  by  their  beliefs to be the last remnant of Halanna, ancient Goddess of\nEarth.  Adherents  of the Ashentree Pact believe that fey should reclaim their lost lands and\nplant  a  new World Tree to save both the Prime Material plane and the Feyrealm from the\nSeverance,  complete  separation of both worlds and loss of all magic in Halann.

 page_events.107.d: "\nThe   Avariel  are  mythological  ethnic  group  of  elves  that  were  allegedly  the  original\nprogenitors  of  elvenkind.  They  were  said  to resemble winged elves and were apparently\nwiped  out during the Godswar and Rule of Dragons, or eventually became the ancestors of\nangels and harpies.\n\n==Origin==\n===In Regent Court Mythology===\nIt  is  said  that  the  Avariel was the servant-race created by Castellos (as Halanna did with\nthe  dwarves)  and were made to become attendants and courtiers of Castellos' divine court\nalongside dragons, which were created by Castellos and Agrados beforehand.\n\nThe  race  largely  loyal  to  their  creator  during the Godswar and became messengers and\nrepresentatives  between the heavens (which the gods retreated to as per the Godly Decrees\nafter  the  war)  and  the  material  plane  (which  had  now  been left in the stewardship of\ndragonkind).  Those  that  fought against Castellos were banished to hell and likely became\nprogenitors of the succubus race.\n\nThis would not last long, and after the draconic victory in the Inheritance War in which the\ndraconic  race,  under their leader Malliath, warred against the gods to claim their divinity,\nmany  avariel were trapped on both planes without a means to return. The Inheritance War\nclosed  the  link  between  the  celestial  plane and the material plane that the avariels often\ntravelled  between,  and  those  who  resided  in  the  the  heavens became angels and those\ntrapped in the material plane became elves.\n\n===Progentior of Harpykind?===\nIn  the  1600s  the  famous genealogist Sendrian Bloodfollower proposed the theory that as\nharpies  are  able to breed to elves, that they share the same biological ancestor similarly to\nhumans  and elvenkind. He proposed a theory in his Thesis on the Alleged Monsters of the\nWorld  in  1696  in  which the harpy race was in fact a degenerative variant of the avariel -\nand that the avariel race actually were the progenitors not only of elves but also harpies. As\npart  of  his theory he sought to disprove the celestial link between elves and angels through\navariels, and claimed that angels were not related to elvenkind in any way."

Throughout history,\nthere  have  been  many  supposed  avatars  whose  claims  to  divinity  were  denied by the\nPantheonic Councils.\n\n*  Castan Beastbane’s extraordinary success in hunting down the various Spawns of Agrados\nmade many see him as an instrument of Falah’s will, and even as an avatar of Falah herself.\nThis notion was however ultimately rejected at the Pantheonic Councils by the conservative\nFalah  priesthood,  who  saw  the  palatial  lifestyle of an emperor as incompatible with the\nsimple life that Falah prescribed.\n*  As  the  originator of the Adenic faith in Lencenor, some later Lencori rulers would push\nto  have  Crovan  Spearsworn  recognized  as  an  avatar  of Adean, out of a mix of genuine\nreverence  and desire to glorify their own history. The actual deeds of his life were however\nseen as lacking to the rest of Cannor for a supposed avatar of war. His petition struggled to\ngain majority acceptance even among the Lencori clergy, and was summarily rejected.\n*  Alaria  Lifehand’s  miraculous powers of healing was unlike anything the Cannorians had\never  seen,  to  the  point  where  only  a  divine  explanation  seemed  feasible. During the\nSeventh  Pantheonic  Council  there  were  many  who  appealed  for  her to be declared an\navatar  of  Esmaryal,  or  even  to  declare  her  a newly risen god alongside Munas. Unlike\nMunas,  however,  Alaria  had  refused to worship any of the Cannorian gods, insisting that\nThe  Ruin  proved  that  no  gods  were deserving of praise. And while the council was fine\nwith   proclaiming   an   elf  as  a  brand  new  deity,  many  still  had  reservations  with  a\ntraditionally  human  deity  having  an  elven avatar. The council ended up deciding that, if\nAlaria had indeed been an avatar, she must have been an avatar of a god outside the Court."
 page_events.1695.t: "Avatar 5 / 7"
 page_events.1695.d: "\n*  After  Aldresia’s  heroic leadership in the White Pestilence, many would talk of her as an\navatar,  with  the  clergies  of Nerat and Adean both claiming her for their respective deity.\nUnfortunately,  this mutual claim would be what ultimately killed Aldresias canonization at\nthe  Seventh  Pantheonic  Council,  as  the  council never could decide which deity she was\nsupposed to be an avatar of.\n*  In preparation for the Tenth Pantheonic Council, the priesthoods of Castellos and Adean\nscrambled to find an avatar of their god among the Marcher Lords, as they didn’t want their\ndeities  to  seem passive in the face of Escann’s destruction. The Castellosian priests singled\nout  Carleon  Blacktower  as  the  preserver  of  Castellyr  and  embodiment  of  Castellos’\nleadership.   There   were   however  serious  doubts  regarding  the  promise  of  Castellos\nappearing  specifically  in  the  form of the Silver Dragon. Even accounting for the original\nSilver  Dragon’s  death in the Dragonwake, Carleon seemed like a poor substitute. It's said\neven  Carleon  himself  jokingly  wondered  when his claws and tail would grow out. There\nwere  also  concerns  regarding  Carleon’s  relatively low birth, and especially regarding the\nsupposed  avatar  of  Castellos  taking  orders  from the avatar of a lesser deity. The Adenic\nclergy  set  their eyes on Gryf the Young, who had become the most renowned knight of the\nGreentide,  and  even  fought  alongside Corin in the Battle of Castonath. However, Gryf’s\ndefiance  of  his  father  and  king  seemed  distinctly  un-Adenic.  Furthermore,  his  vocal\nsupport   of   Corin   taking  Adean’s  portfolio  of  warfare  drastically  soured  the  Adenic\npriesthood’s  opinion  of  him.  Other  notable knights like Galinda of the Sword Covenant\nand  Maugunia  of  the  Order  of  the  Ashen  Rose  would  all  show similar issues. More\nspurious  attempts  to  find  avatars  included  the  elevation of minor adventurers based on\nlocal  hearsay  and  their  own  tall tales, supposed Silver Dragon sightings with no physical\ntraces  and suspiciously few witnesses, and some desperate priests even arguing for Corin as\nan  avatar of Castellos or Adean against the testimony of her own companions. It's believed\nthat  the  failure  to  find  a  suitable  avatar  of Castellos or Adean to share in Corin’s glory\nwould  contribute  to  the  former  two  deities  falling  out  of  favor  in Escann, eventually\ncontributing to the Corinite Schism.\n\n===Alleged Avatars==="

The crusader’s fight against the supposed spawn of\nMalliath  in Aelantir felt too similar to the Marcher Lords’ struggle against the Dookanson,\nand  Sybille’s  striking red hair looked too much like the idols of Corin. It wasn’t long until\nthe  crusaders  declared  her  Corin’s  avatar, with her closest companions and subordinates\nforming  a  new  Circle  around her. Her cult was viewed with skepticism among the wider\nCorinite   temples,  and  with  Sybille’s  death  and  the  Istralorian  Crusade’s  failure,  her\nfollowers scattered and her claim to avatarhood was dismissed.\n*  The  Freemarcher  Falah  priestess Muroga the Huntress was declared an avatar of Falah\nafter  supposedly coming back from the dead and holding off the Cursed Ones for almost a\ndecade.  Due  to  the  remoteness  of the Freemarches and the lack of Pantheonic Councils\nsince  the  Corinite  Schism,  this  claim  has largely gone ignored by the rest of the Regent\nCourt world.\n\n===Avatars in other religions===\nThe  concept  of  avatars  has  also  sometimes  been  applied to religions outside of Regent\nCourt.\n\n*  The  orcs  of  Ozgarom  worship  Bramash  the  Liberator as an avatar of Great Dookan,\nhaving deified him as the god of liberty, unyielding will and resistance to oppression.\n*  Following  the  discovery  of  the Precursor Elf Ducaniel having been responsible for the\ncreation  of  orcs,  some  orcs  have  argued  that  Ducaniel was actually an avatar of Great\nDookan."

 page_events.111.t: "Bal Vertesk 1 / 2"
 page_events.111.d: "\nBal  Vertesk  is  the  titular "Black Tower" for which the Free City of Vertesk is named. It\nwas  designed  and  built  by  Balgar  the  Builder,  said  to  be  completed in 593 AA. It is\ncounted  among  Balgar's  Wonders.  It  is  notable  as  the  central  nexus  of  the  Vertesk\nDominion,  the  vassal-state  of  Black  Castanor which was abolished following the War of\nthe  Sorcerer  King.  During  this  time,  Vertesk was under the rule of Highlord Venac the\nArrogant.  It is from this rule that his descents take the name Blacktower, with such known\nmembers of the line as those that rule the Count's League in Escann.\n\n== Construction and Later Modifications ==\nBal  Vertesk,  despite  what  some  might  think,  is  crafted  from  the  same  pale stone as\nCastanor's  walls. However, during Venac's reign, the sorcerer summoned forth his magics\nto  alter  the tower's stones, further hardening them, and giving them the distinct black cast\nfrom  which  his  descendants  take  their  name.  Largely  in  disrepair  by  1444, much of\nVertesk's  efforts  in  the  period  centered  around  repairing  and improving upon Balgar's\noriginal  design,  playing upon the ominous reputation granted by the tower's dark stones to\ncreate  a  much  more imposing appearance. Whereas the original construction was similar\nto  Balgar's  other  works,  the  later  reconstruction took a number of departures, adding a\nmuch  more  imposing  crest  to  the  tower's  peak.  Jagged  and spiny, it was said to cast a\nshadow  "like the maw of a great dragon" upon the city's streets, as an open threat to those\ndissidents who would oppose its elites.\n\n== Use ==\nThe  tower  has long been used as the administrative center of the city, but after by the time\nof  the  Lilac  Wars  the  decrepit  tower  was  shared  by  the  Magisterium  and  Vertesk's\nconstabulary,  which  was  remarkable  for  its  similarity  to  the  "secret  police"  of some\nmodern  authoritarian  states, who actively brutalized any citizens who the Republic's rulers\nconsidered to be subversive. In this period, the fortress served as a nexus of administration,\nespionage, and military matters domestic and foreign.\n\nIn later years, it was equipped with a number of bright lights crafted by the city's Artificers,\nwhich  were  operated  in  such  a  manner  as  to  sweep  across the streets in search of any\nunscrupulous  activities  (those  which  were  of  course,  not sanctioned by the state). This\nensured  that there was no respite from the presence of authority that the tower created, the\nlights becoming the night's answer to the great shadow cast in the day."

With supplies\nlow  and  severe  injuries  numerous,  many  were left to bleed out in the cold calculus that\nonly the most desperate of conflict can inspire.\n\nBarry was one of these many cases; he had been struck a hefty blow on the side of his head.\nHowever,  being  an  elf  of  great  vigor  and resilience, he managed to be significantly less\nvegetative-  or  dead-  than a great many of his cohorts, leading to him being noticed by the\nFriends  of  the  Empty  Mug,  a minor guild of Wexonard fighters. They rescued him, and\ntended to him as best as they could.\n\nAs one may expect from one’s skull becoming rather intimate with the heavy end of a mace,\nBarry  had  severe cranial trauma. From this point onwards, as far as his recollection, Varil\nMoonbeam   was   dead;   all   memories  of  him  had  flowed  onto  the  grassy  plains  of\nCatelsvord.  All he remembered was his name- something that rapidly altered, as he would\nadopt the Wexonards’ alenized nickname for him; Barry."

 page_events.1699.d: "\n\nOnce healed and relatively functional, he quickly adopted his saviors’ boisterous and rowdy\nways;  he  would officially be inducted by the head of the guild, Ryan Whitewhisker, on the\n17th  of  Silversight.  Barry,  at  this  point  in  time  being essentially a blank slate, swiftly\nadopted  their  customs  and  traditions,  becoming Wexonard in everything but his eartips.\nWhat  Barry  took  to even better than any other aspect of Wexonard culture, however, was\nale.  His  capacity  for drink became near-legendary, with many a young knight challenging\nhim to a drinking competition, only to be thoroughly outpaced and embarrassed.\n\nThe  Friends  of  the Empty Mug would go on to serve valiantly throughout the duration of\nthe War of the Sorcerer-King, never losing a battle- although many other bands they fought\nalongside  would  frequently  complain  of  their  overly  loud  revelry  and  near-perpetual\ndrunkenness.  The  Friends  of  the  Empty  Mug would officially become the Order of the\nEmpty  Mug,  a  knightly  order  following  the chivalric ideals of Caylen Longlance (albeit\nrather  loosely)  on  Suren  of  1016,  marking  them as one of the first knightly orders. Sir\nRyan  Whitewhisker  would  get  to the quarter-final rounds of the championship to decide\nwho  would  fight at the Battle of Trialmount against Nichmer himself, but was disqualified\nafter sleeping through his match in a drunken stupor.\n\n== Interregnum ==\nUpon  the  end  of  the  War  of  the  Sorcerer-King in 1020, the Order of the Empty Mug\nreturned  to the Duchy of Wexhills; specifically, the barony of Amberflow, owned by Baron\nConric IV, the patron of the guild-turned-knightly order.\n\nBaron  Conric  IV  was  inflicted  with  a  disease  described  by  accounts  only as “utterly\nwretched”,  giving  him  a  particularly pallid, corpse-like appearance, severe coughing fits,\nand the appearance of blackened, brittle skin (appearing severely burnt) along his arms and\nlegs.  His disease had progressed to a terminally late stage, and his wife hadn’t produced an\nheir.  Realizing  that  his  life  was  quickly  drawing  to a close, the Baron decided that his\nbarony  should  go  to one of the bold fighters who he had acted as a patron for for so long,\nas  they  were  the  closest  thing to children that he had; the question that ate at his addled\nmind,  however,  was  how  he  would  decide which knight would be the victor? Suddenly,\ninspiration  struck  him.  It  was obvious; what would be the best way to choose the greatest\nknight of the Empty Mug?"

His first\nact  as baron was, of course, to hold a grand feast, with ale aplenty. He invited not only his\nformer  brothers  in  the  Order  of the Empty Mug, but also many local peasants as well as\nsurrounding nobles. To the great surprise of no one, the nobles mostly chose not to attend.\n\nSuch  an  event was largely representative of the early periods of his reign. Often dismissed\nby  his noble peers and lieges for his uncouth and drunken manner, he was greatly loved by\nhis  peasantry  for  his  revelry  and  his  rather  lax obligations. Barry’s taxation policy was\nstrangely  demented  for  the  time  period,  with  tax collectors often given odd, vague, and\nborderline  unfillable  instructions  such as “however much they feel comfortable giving” or\n‘however much a barrel of ale costs in Wexkeep’.\n\nBarry  continued  his  predecessor’s  patronage  of  the Order of the Empty Mug. While his\nabsence from the order left a Barry-sized hole in their drunken hearts, the Order flourished\nmore than ever, with tales of their exploits being known throughout Wexonard lands.\n\nAs  Barry aged, his knowledge of governance solidified. His edicts were less confused, with\nhis  tax  policy  remaining  compassionate,  albeit  much  less erratic. Due to his newfound\nseniority,  his  service  in  the War of the Sorcerer-King, and his feasts, the nobility of Wex\nbegan  to  respect  him. He had assistance, of course; he began to listen to the advice of the\nlate  Baron  Conric  IV’s  wife,  Alice of Ottocam, who had remained in his court after her\nhusband’s   death.   Knowledgeable   in   matters  of  court,  she  managed  to  save  Barry’s\nreputation  with  his  neighbors  and  liege,  with Dyren sil Wex, who had been just a child\nwhen Barry gained the barony, becoming one of Barry’s closest friends."

 page_events.1701.d: "\n\nOf  course,  time  stops  for  no  Wexonard; Barry found himself heavily burdened with the\nuniquely  saddening  understanding  of  entropy  familiar  to any elf who surrounds himself\nentirely  with  humans.  As  Barry  remained fairly the same, his friends gradually got older\nand  older,  dying  and  swiftly  becoming  dust  and  memories.  This  existential period of\nBarry’s  rule  would start about 120 years after his confirmation, and would be marked by a\nsharp decline in his famous feasts, with an increase in his consumption of ale.\n\nEvidently, after about 30 or so years, he managed to pull himself out of this slump, with his\nfeasts  gradually increasing in time. However, his consumption of alcohol never went down\nin  any significant amount; if anything, it seemed to increase over time, with hearsay reports\nthat  he  would  consume  up to 3 to 5 barrels of ale on a daily basis towards the end of his\nlife.  He  remained  a  curiosity  for  other Wexonard barons, with attendance to one of his\nfamous feasts being considered something worthy of bragging.\n\n== Personality and Character ==\nBarry  was  well-known  for  being  an  extremely  agreeable  and gracious host. Petty King\nDyren of Wexhills, Barry’s first liege, wrote that Barry was ‘possibly one of the kindest folk\nhe had ever known’ and that ‘his feasts were the envy of Cannor’; obviously an exaggeration,\nbut the account does lend credence to his skills in revelry.\n\nHe  embraced  Wexonard culture completely, forgoing his own native Moon Elven culture.\nHe  was  well known as a jolly elf, and was well liked by his subjects due to his defiance of\nthe   common   stereotype   of  the  stuck-up,  high-and-mighty  elf;  Barry  was  unique  in\ncomparison  to  many rulers of his era due to his lack of qualms about going to taverns and\ngrabbing  a  pint  with commoners. This practice would earn him the scorn of many nobles\nearly into his rule.\n\nBarry  would  never  marry, and any sources indicating any trysts or affairs have yet to have\never  been  located.  When  asked  about  his  marital  status, Barry would often reply “I’m\nalready married to me true love- an’ ale is me wife!”"

Baron  Anders  of Threeguard, a close friend of Barry’s during his final years, was\nquoted  as  saying  “If  anything, his love of drink seemed to have preserved his spirit rather\nthan rotting his insides, as it would have done to a weaker individual.”\n\nAs  per his last wishes, he was buried in the Amberflow cemetery, amongst the peasantry he\nspent  hundreds  of  years  reveling  and  drinking with. Despite the humble location of his\nburial,  his  funeral was extravagant, with barons, counts, and even the Grand Duke of Wex\nand  his young son attending, to see off the elf who had been a kind and gregarious voice in\nWexonard politics for hundreds of years.\n\n== Legacy ==\nDue  to  Barry’s lack of an heir, the barony of Amberflow would fall directly under the rule\nof  the  Grand Duke of Wex. The village surrounding the barony would chafe at the loss of\ntheir  formerly  lax obligations, and many villagers left for more prosperous locales. Barry’s\nfavorite  tavern,  the  Riverside  Inn, would close in 1386 after a famine that left the family\noperating it unable to pay their taxes.\n\nThe Order of the Empty Mug would be utterly wiped out by Damerian forces in 1443 after\na  risky,  poorly  advised,  and  entirely  ale-fueled  maneuver  meant  to  flush  out  Adénn\nSkylance  early,  during the siege of the Imperial Palace in the Damesear during the Fourth\nLilac  War.

 page_events.131.d: "\nThe Battle of Red Reach was the clash that marked the end of the Lencori Warlord Period.\nThe  amalgamation  of Lencori armies led by their new High King, Lorenan the Great, met\nthe  last  invading  army of the Gawedi Kingdom in the fields north of the Ruby Mountains\nwhich would later be known as Lorenan's Reach and the Duchy of Rosefield/Laseán\n\n==Prelude==\nWith the Gawedi warlords being expelled from Lencenor itself after the Battle of Rosefield\nin  525,  Lorenan  and his combined host returned south to Lorent-by-the-River, where the\nLorenti  king  was  crowned  High  King  of  Lencenor  with the support of the kings of the\nSormanni,  Entebic,  Iochander  and  Tretunic  kingdoms  and  the blessing of the Dwarven\nKing  of  Rubyhold,  who  presented the masterwork that is the Ruby Crown as a gift to the\nnew High King. The Lencori celebrated, but all knew that the region wasn't safe yet.\n\n===Preparations===\nWith  the remaining Gawedi warlord scattered around the Small Kingdom, King Godrac II\nGawe  saw  an  opportunity  to  absorb  them  into  his growing realm and finally break the\nLencori  resistance. To this end, he gathered a great host and placed it under the command\nof his firstborn and favourite son: the famed Prince Ulric Gawe, called "The Eagle" by his\nmen  after  his bravery and the coat of arms of his family. Prince Godryc Gawe, his middle\nbrother,  was  initially  chosen as second-in-command of the Gawedi host, but his untimely\ndeath  led  to  the  younger  brother,  Alenn  Gawe,  to  go  with  Ulric instead of staying in\nVertesk. And so, in the late spring of 529, they left Vertesk and headed southwest.\n\nHigh  King  Lorenan  received  word of this great Gawedi host from the remaining Lencori\ntribes  in  the  Lorentish Approach, and wasted no time in meaningless discussion. He sent\nmessages   for   all   kings   who   owed   him   allegiance   to   gather  their  men  and  left\nLorent-by-the-River on the 10th of Suren, riding southwest.\n\nThus  began  Lorenan's  Ride,  as  the  High  King  rode  far  and wide with his famed rose\nbanner. His vassals on the lower Bloodwine were the first to meet him, Rubenti petty kings\nthat  had  submitted  to  the High King in the past years, and they refused to follow his call\nonly  for  their  will  to  be overruled by their own subjects, who joined Lorenan en masse.\nStill riding southwest, he met both the Sormanni and Entebic kings at New Adea, where his\ninfant  son  Caylen  met  his  would-be  wife  Herlinda  for  the  first  time  as their parents\naffirmed  their  alliance.  With  the  Entebics on his side and the Sormanni loyal, the High\nKing rode east. He hoped to meet the Tretunic king and, gods willing, convince the king of\nCarneter  to  join  the  struggle,  but  he  found  both rulers in a serious feud over the lands\ntaken by Carneter during the years following the fall of the Lencori Empire. Unable to deal\nbetween  the  kings and with time as his enemy, Lorenan left the West Dameshead with the\nloyalty  of  the  Tretunics, while the Carnetoris fortified their northern borders and rejected\nthe notion of a High King ruling over the Carnetoris dynasty."

 page_events.1708.d: "\n\nWith  the  might  of  all loyal soldiers south of the Ruby mountains, the combined Lencori\narmy  began  its  march  north  in  late  Teysuren as Lorenan and a portion of his Lorentish\ncavalry rode to the northwest, crossing the Ruby Pass and going around the Redwood. They\narrived at the Iochander court in Roynoms, where two whole days of negotiations were held\nbefore  the  High  King  secured  the Iochander troops. On his way back east he secured an\nalliance  with  the  Halfling  prince  of  Roysfort and finally met his united Lencori army at\nRosefield, near the place where he had beaten the Gawedi four years prior.\n\nStudying  the  area,  the Lencori built a series of fortified camps next to the Southroy river,\nwhere  they  met  an army of dwarves from Rubyhold led by General Bolin Stonearm and a\nnumber of Halfling troops coming from Roysfort, honouring their new alliance and the call\nto arms.\n\nThe   Gawedi  host  spent  the  summer  subjugating  the  Gawedi  warlords  in  the  Small\nKingdom, and finally approached the Lencori positions in mid Bloomsend. After a week of\nmovements, the two armies faced each other in the fields next to the Southroy.\n\n== The Battle==\nWith  the  Southroy  river  protecting the Gawedi right flank and the Lencori left flank, the\norder of battle was simple: infantry in the center and cavalry in the only available flank.\n\nBoth  armies  clashed  in  the  open  field, and it was in one of these clashes when Lorenan\nhimself  took  command  of the infantry at the center, leading from the front. Prince Alenn\nGawe  saw  his  personal  banner  (the Lorentis Rose) and challenged him to single combat\nright  there  amongst  the  corpses of Dwarves, Halflings and Men. Both men duelled until\nLorenan, ten years older than the young prince, got a hit in. There was a commotion in the\nGawedi  host,  and  Prince  Ulric  himself  surged  forward  and  pushed  his  brother away\nforcefully, taking his place in the duel. Both Ulric and Lorenan were famed leaders of men\nand  of  a  similar  age,  but  in  the  end the High King bested his foe with a precise sword\nthrust  to  his  neck.  Morale  amidst the Gawedi plummeted, and they broke with the next\ncavalry charge."

Wounded, tired and without any good will from the local populations, they\nsuffered  from  a  general  lack  of  supplies even with the Lencori troops giving them food.\nPrince  Alenn  himself  is  said to have fallen deep into depression, blaming himself for the\ndeath  of  his  older  brother,  and  he succumbed to his wounds a week after the battle was\nover.\n\nWith  this  victory  the  rule  of  Lorenan  was  secured  for  the  rest  of  his life, with him\nachieving  his  modern  image  of  father  of  the Lorentish and ancestor of the Kingdom of\nLorent,  while  the  death  of  the  Gawedi  princes  forced king Godrac II to legitimize his\nbastard  son Godrac as heir, with the weak succession being the last nail in the coffin of the\nGawedi invasions of Lencenor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
 page_events.132.t: "Battle of Rosefield 1 / 2"
 page_events.132.d: "\nThe  Battle of Rosefield was the first of the two great victories of Lorenan the Great against\nthe  Gawedi  warlords  who  had  plagued  his  homeland  for  the  last 45 years, during the\nGawedi Invasions of Lencenor.\n\n== Prelude ==\nThe  Lencori  Warlord  Period  had  lasted  45  years,  and  the  last ten years had seen the\nmeteoric  rise  of  Lorenan  the  Great.  The  leader  of  the Lorenti, a tribe of the Rubenti\npeoples,  had  united these people into the Lorentish Kingdom in the year 523, dominating\nthe  Bloodwine  River  after  defeating the Rubenti warlords downstream and, together with\nthe  dwarves  of  Rubyhold,  organized  a  set of alliances to expel the northern invaders for\ngood.\n\nIn  the  year 525 the last Gawedi Warlords made an alliance to oppose the Lencori, hoping\nto  turn  the  tide  by  drawing the Lencori armies out of their advantageous positions to the\nsouth  of  the Redwood. To this end, they attacked the territories of the Lorentish Kingdom\nnorth of the Ruby Mountains, burned a good number of Lorenti settlements and waited.\n\nAs  soon  as  the  first  groups  of  refugees  made  their  way  to  Lorent-by-the-River, King\nLorenan called upon his allies and loyalists, and together with the influence of Rubyhold he\nreceived  aid  from  the  Tretunic  and  Sormanni  kingdoms,  and even a promise from the\nEntebic  king  to  not  attack  his realm while he dealt with the invaders. This force crossed\nthe  Ruby  Pass  unopposed  yet  spent the next month finding nothing but empty, destroyed\nsettlements.  Unable to find the Gawedi, the only armed group that came to Lorenan was a\nlarge  group  of  Iochander cavalrymen who had come to counterraid the Alenics. With the\nallied  kings  growing  anxious,  Lorenan  had  no  choice but to order his men to begin the\nmove  south.  His  Lencori army made camp next to a large field of roses, and it was in the\nearly morning of the next day when, out of nowhere, the Gawedi attacked.\n\n== The Battle ==\nWhile  some  called  to  abandon  the  camp and retreat, King Lorenan was undisturbed by\ntheir  pleas and gave the order to face the enemy they had come to fight. With little time to\norganize,  men from all Lencori tribes fought side by side as infantry while all the available\ncavalry  (of  mostly  Lorenti  and  Iochander  origin) was put under the direct command of\nLorenan."

All  of  the  Gawedi infantry was engaged in\ncombat, however, and the tide changed when Lorenan the Great joined the fray. Covered in\nan  armour  of  Rosemetal  and  Dwarven  steel and with a lilac shield on his right arm, the\nking  of  the  Lorentish  charged  at  the  head  of his Lencori cavalry, forming a wedge and\nopening  a  breach  in  the  Gawedi  line.  Instead  of stopping to face the now broken line,\nhowever,  Lorenan  pressed  on  aiming  for  the  Gawedi  warlords themselves. He himself\nslayed the lord of the Redwood, and the Gawedi army fled in disarray.\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe  whole  Lencori  army  was  by  now  covered  in rose petals, blood or a mix both, and\nLorenan  himself and his horse, who were said to have pushed through more than one thick\nrosebush  in  their  charge,  most  of  all. A Gawedi arrow had pierced a great red rose and\nfixed  it  to  the center of his shield: the first appearance of the Lorentish Rose in historical\nrecords.  Lorenan  took  the  symbol  as  his  own,  raising  his  shield  for  all  to  see  and\nproclaiming  all  of them to be one united Rose Army. In response, Lorenan was acclaimed\nHigh King by both the soldiers and the kings of the Tretunics and the Sormanni.\n\nUpon  his return to Lorent-by-the-River, Lorenan was presented the Ruby Crown of Lorent\nby  envoys  of the King of Rubyhold himself, and so began the High Kingdom of Lencenor.\nThe  Iochander  soldiers  had  already  acclaimed him as High King at Rosefield, and King\nFizwick I Allspark swore fealty to Lorenan in the following months. The Entebic Kingdom,\nthe  last remaining Lencori realm not within Lorenan's Realm, wouldn't join until the birth\nof Caylen, the youngest son of Lorenan, and his betrothal to the Entebic princess Herlinda.\n\nMeanwhile,  many Gawedi fled north towards the Gawedi Kingdom after being expelled by\nthe  victorious  Lencori,  drawing  King  Godric II's attention towards Lencenor. The fight\nagainst  the  Gawedi  wasn't  over,  and it wouldn't be solved until the Battle of Red Reach\nfour years later."

Beltram was of the Ventis, vassals of Morganne’s\nfamily, and was trained as not only the heir of his lands but also as a valiant warrior.\n\nSince  the arrival of the Remnant Fleet carrying the elves in 1000, Cannor has changed, the\nUpper  Bloodwine not spared of that change. The Lorenti began to adopt the culture of the\nElves,  and  as  Beltram  and  Morganne  grew  up their two families drifted apart from the\nchange.  Morganne’s  family  emulated  the  elves,  while Beltram’s remained proud of their\nLorenti  culture.  Despite  the  growing  gulf  between the families, Morganne and Beltram\nwere bound together to strengthen the dynasty: in case of death leaving one of them as head\nof the family, they were to be married.\n\nGrowing up during the War of the Sorcerer King was a tumultuous time: their parents told\nthem  of  a  great  battle  upriver  at  Lorentaine  in  1000,  spooking  them  by  saying  the\nBloodwine  turned  the same color as it’s namesake. Beltram’s father was present during the\nbattle  and  was celebrated as a hero, but it is known that there would have been no heroics\nwere  it not for the arrival of the Elves. Beltram yearned to follow in the steps of his father,\nand  in 1018 at the Battle of Elderlan. The League of Free Realms had broken through the\nWhite  Walls  of  Castanor  and  was  on  its  way to Castonath when it was met by a fierce\nattack  that  almost  resulted  in  a  rout.  Beltram  rallied his Lorenti kin against the Black\nCastanorians  and  won  the battle, but in the aftermath found his father dead. He returned\nhome to Lorent to find his mother had expired to disease.\n"

 page_events.1714.d: "\nMorganne ruled the Upper Bloodwine for nearly two years before Beltram arrived home in\n1019.  A bittersweet celebration was planned, for as the survivors of their family they were\nto  be  married.  The  marriage  was  planned to happen on the first day of 1020, until then\nthey  had  ruled  jointly the duchy of Upper Bloodwine. Morganne was apprehensive about\nthe  return  of  Beltram:  he  was  different  from  the  boy  she  fell in love with, mean and\nresentful.  She  also  felt  threatened  that  her  rule  over  the duchy was questioned by her\nbetrothed,  when  before  she  could  make  her  own  decisions.  Meanwhile  the  war  was\napproaching  its  end, with more of the Lorentish men returning. Among those who arrived\nat  the court in Kyliande was a beautiful Elf by the name of Alvarion, on the very eve of the\nwedding.  The  bride  walked  through the moonlit gardens that night and glimpsed the tall\nfigure  tending  to  a  rose;  Alvarion  handed  that rose to her. Before the evening was over\nMorganne  had  fallen  for the enchanting Alvarion. And Beltram snuck to her chambers in\nthe night before the wedding and saw the two.\n\nBeltram  knew  what  this  was  all about: the elves thought they could steal their land, and\nnow  even their wives! If they are so much better than us, then how has our land grown and\nprospered  without  them?  Why  should  he  let his land be overtaken and the legacy of my\nfather be squandered by this foppish elf and his fancy mannerisms?\n\nBeltram  left  Kyliande  for  his  home of Palevine and restored rule over it for himself. He\nproclaimed  far  and wide of Morganne’s betrayal and of his claim to the duchy, for she was\nthe  one  who  broke  the  pact  created  by  their parents that had promised their marriage.\nMany  in  the  duchy agreed with his words and flocked to his banner, having followed him\nin the war or being disgruntled with the elves, but many pledged loyalty to Morganne as the\nduchess  of  the  Upper  Bloodwine.  She  claimed  that  the  duchy  was  her  birthright as\ndaughter  of  the  late duke, and that as ruler of the duchy she had full authority over whom\nshe could marry.\n\nThe  Queen-Regent  Ioriel  has  so  far mediated the peace between the quarrelling couple.\nThe  two  sides  have  fortified  their  holdings  over  the  Upper Bloodwine, almost clearly\nseparated  between  the old Lorenti and the elven-aligned Lorentish. The duchy would have\nbeen  split  were it not for Beltram’s pride and rage: for he had insulted the Queen-Regent’s\nson  Rean,  calling  him  a  halfblood  bastard.  Although she resents this biting remark she\ncannot  take immediate action, for his claim is as valid as Morganne’s and his popularity as\na war hero."

The Sarda Ruinborn, despite not\npossessing  Veykodan  Rune Magic nor a tradition of warriors, were able to settle the Sarda\nregion and drive out the Veykodans that previously inhabited it.\n\nIn  this  context,  King  Bemo's  story  is sometimes used as a narrative to explain how this\ncame  to  be:  the Sarda, despite lacking the magical powers King Bemo commanded, were\nable to better coexist in society with one another, and that was what gave them true power.\n\nOn  the  other  hand,  one  must  never  forget  the  limits  of  such  a  narrative: the Sarda\nthemselves  weren't  always  above  infighting  and  betrayal, as the experiences of the Ynnic\nEmpire's civil wars or the more recent Adrahel's Rebellion can attest.\n"

 page_events.151.d: "\nThe  Black Demesne is a radical ideology espousing magical supremacy and the unification\nof  Halann  under  a  single  magocratic  state,  namely  the eponymous Black Demesne. It\nbegan  as  a  thought  experiment  by  Adelar  síl  na  Whistlehill  of  the Order of the Iron\nSceptre,  but  later  gained  a  following  of  its  own  during  the Age of Witch-Kings, with\ncollaborators  adding  more  and more details until it rose to the status of an ideology in its\nown right.\n\n==History==\nThe  Black  Demesne  was  developed  by  Adelar  síl  na  Whistlehill  during the Crimson\nDeluge. Originating as a series of sketches and ramblings in various journals, Adelar would\nwrite  criticisms of followers of both Corinite and Regent Court for their blind following of\nthe  gods and the destruction that has caused across Cannor. Adelar described a society led\nby  mortal-controlled magic without any reliance on the gods as true strength with limitless\npotential.  Although Adelar would die in the mid 1500s due to sickness, his journals would\nresurface  and  spread  amongst  like-minded  individuals  during  the  war  of the Corinite\nLeague and again with the rise of Floodborn.\n\n==Politics==\nUnder  the  theoretical  framework  espoused  by  Adelar, the Black Demesne would be an\nautocracy  led  by  a  Sorcerer-King  served by eight Acolytes. Below the Acolytes were the\nApostles.  This  ruling  body  would  be  represented  by  a  Skull  Throne  upon which the\nSorcerer-King,  who  would  later be amended to being the "Ascendant Dragon", would sit\nupon  as a representation of their authority over even the dead. The "Skull Throne" is also\nwritten  at  some  points  as  the  ruling  body,  with  all  authority  belonging to the "Skull\nThrone".\n\nUnder  the  Dark  Degree, all territories held by the Black Demesne would secede entirely\nfrom  the  Empire  of  Anbennar,  disavowing all rights and obligations and recognizing the\nSkull  Throne  as their sole sovereign. Should the Skull Throne perish for whatever reason,\nthe  later  pages  of  the  journal detail a general agreement that the strongest mage amongst\nthe  acolytes  would  take  up the mantle through a tournament. This addendum is likely to\nmaintain  neutrality  and a common goal amongst followers of the Black Demesne ideology\nas   many   supporters   sought  the  aspect  of  immortality  and  would  not  plan  to  ever\npermanently die."

These troops would be organized under the Black Host,\nan  aggregation of different military and administrative bodies from across their dominions.\nThis unified organization was meant to be flexible and uphold the values of the Acolytes.\n\nPotential  campaigns  for  the  Black  Demesne  were  titled "Black Invasions", the goal of\nthese  invasions  was  to be able to completely annex large swaths of land through either the\ndistribution  of the land amongst Acolytes or the efficient deployment of undead regiments.\nThis is often seen as one of the more unrealistic ambitions of the Black Demesne .\n\n==Religion==\nThe  religious  creed  of  the  Black  Demesne was termed the Black Doctrine and rejected\nworship  of  any  and  all  gods, taking the position that "gods" are merely highly magically\npowerful  beings.  Followers  believed  the  world  was fundamentally chaotic and that only\nmagic  could  tame  said  chaos.  It  also espoused total equality, with all being equal under\nmagical  law.  Most  controversially,  it  took  the  position that sufficiently powerful mages\ncould become as gods themselves.\n\n==Culture==\nThe culture of the Black Demesne would be heavily focused around the Ascendant Dragon,\nfrom  mandatory  prostrations  at  midnight  where  each  citizen  bows  in  the direction of\nCastonath  (the  proposed  seat  of  power)  to a total reverence to the hierarchy of magical\npower,  where  the  Ascendant  Dragon  sat  at  the  top.

 page_events.164.d: "\nThe  Blue  Reachmen  Wars of Independence (1001 - 1024) was a conflict during the War\nof  the  Sorcerer-King  fought  between  the  Blue  Reachmen  states  and  the  Kingdom of\nAdshaw who had been their overlord. The war saw early guerrilla warfare over a prolonged\nperiod  of  time marked by periods of relative peace and plotting behind closed doors. The\nresult  of  the  wars  were  the  independence  of  the  Western  Reachmen  from Adshaw in\naddition to the independence of the Old Alenic counties of Frostwall and Dinesck.\n\n== History ==\n=== Prelude ===\nIn 979 the city-state of Vertesk was conquered by the Kingdom of Gawed, which eventually\nsaw  an invitation from Vertesk to Black Castanor to liberate the city. Black Castanor used\nthis  a  pretence  to invade the entirety of the Alenic Frontier, which led to the Kingdom of\nAdshaw  who  had  been  on-and-off  rivals of Gawed to put aside their differences and join\ntheir Alenic brothers to defence of their homeland.\n\nBy  this  time  Adshaw  was the undisputed overlord of all the western Alenic Reach, which\nwas  dominated  by  the  Blue  Reachman culture who, despite their shared heritage of both\nAlenic  and  Gerudian  peoples,  did  not  take lightly to being subjugated by their southern\nAlenic  brethren. This was exacerbated by the fact that most Reachmen relied on urban and\nmercantile trade between settlements and cities on the coast, whereas Adshaw was seen as a\nrural backwater lord from the Greatwoods.\n\nDespite a strong initial resistance, Adshaw capitulated early on in the war after the Burning\nof Aldtempel by Venac the Arrogant, one of the acolytes of the Sorcerer-King. Pledging his\nforces  under  Black  Castanor,  King  Tomar  Adshaw  became  a  critical  part of Venac's\ncampaign which eventually led to Gawed's surrender in 986.\n\n=== Start of the War ===\nThe  defeat  of  two  of the Sorcerer-King's acolytes by elves, first Iacob in 1000 by Garion\nthe  Wise  and  the assassination of Mafalda the Mad in 1001 by Taranath Seerslayer shook\nthe  authority  of  Black  Castanor  who  was then embroiled in the Liberation of Lencenor\nagainst the League of Free Realms who had been bolstered by elven intervention."

After  a  short  1  year period Tomar manages to\nnegotiate a treaty with Adshaw, which grants Bayvic independence so Tomar could focus his\neffort on the remaining Reachmen states, who were also close to rebellion.\n\n=== Adshaw Alone ===\nThe  following  years  were  tumultuous,  and while Tomar managed to keep the rest of the\nBlue  Reachmen  states from rebelling, Tomar fell out of Venac and Black Castanor's good\ngraces  due  to  their withdrawal from the war. In 1013 after Venac's defeat in the Battle of\nDamesteeth,  Venac  executed King Tomar Adshaw and replaced him with his cousin Rylen\nAdshaw  who  promised  to  use  Adshawman  and Blue Reachmen armies in the upcoming\nLiberation of Gawed.\n\nRylen  Adshaw  greatly  mismanaged  the  Reachmen states, reversing much of the progress\nmade  by Tomar in retaining peace, and following the Storming of Vertesk in 1014 and the\ndeath  of Venac the Arrogant, Black Castanor's authority in Gawed and the Alenic Frontier\nquickly eroded and left Adshaw without any allies in the region.\n\nDespite their allegiance to Black Castanor, Adshaw officially declared neutrality during the\nwar  though  some Blue Reachmen mercenary companies and lesser Adshaw nobility joined\nthe Free Realms in their advance into Escann proper.\n\n=== Postwar Conflict ===\nWhile the War of the Sorcerer-King ended in 1020, the situation in Adshaw was still tense,\nand  in  1020  Mayor  Valdemar of Coldmarket, likely fearing retribution by Rylen Adshaw\nfor  his  plotting,  declared  independence  along  with  the  states  of  Alencay,  Envermark,\nReachspier  and  Everwharf.

 page_events.165.d: "\nBluefoot is a term used to broadly describe the halflings who live in the Gawedi-influenced\nnorthern half of the Small Country, derived from the association of blue with Gawed.\n\n==History==\nPrior  to  the  consolidation  of  what  would  become the Bluefoot lands under Gawed, the\nhalflings  of  the  northern  Small  Country  were  divided  into  three  cultural  groups: the\nOakfoot  Halflings  of  Elkmarch  and  Uelaire;  the  Ciderfoot  Halflings  of Pearview and\nButterburn;  and  the  Hillfoot  Halflings  of  Norley,  later  Greymill.  Over time, Gawedi\nhegemony gained through the Tall Wars melded these disparate peoples together, leading to\nthe eventual emergence of the Bluefoots as a distinct people by the First Lilac War.\n\n==Cultural Traditions==\nThe  Gawedi  have  left  their  mark  with  their  pastoral  customs  being  adopted  by  the\nBluefoots. With access to the lower reaches of the Dragonhills during the summer months,\nthe  halfling  herders  of  Butterburn  are  able  to  feed their cows and sheep with highland\ngrass, making for a distinct and rich milk to make butter and cheeses from.\n\nIn  the  Elkmarch,  the local Oakfoots had adapted to life in the dense woods, learning how\nto  hunt,  hide,  and  survive.  Their Bluefoot descendants would continue to keep in touch\nwith  these roots with the practice of keeping a forest cabin and camping in the wild for the\nsummers  becoming  popular among the gentry. Bluefoot marksmanship and forest guerilla\nwarfare owe their success largely to this custom.\n\nProud  and competitive, the Pearlords of Pearview have seeded their second and third (and\nfourth  and  fifth  and sixth) children throughout the north as extensions of their family-run\nbusinesses back home, keeping close economic ties with relatives.

In 320\nPosvleadi braves were pivotal to the survival of the early Adbrabohvi settlement, ambushing\nthe Amstenuri army sent to destroy it in the Battle of Adbrabohvi.\n\nOn  the  Boek's  part,  the name of the Inek Tribe by the Ynnsmouth predates the arrival of\nCannorian  explorers  and  is  instead  associated  with  the Sarda word ''Ynnik''. The Inek\nregularly  gather  the  treasures  contained  within  Ynnic  funerary  barges  and see them as\ntribute from the heavens.\n\nIn the Inek Tribe's origin myth they believe to be the descendants of “warriors [who] came\nfrom  the heavens to unify the warrior tribes of the Boek”. Another legend speaks of “brave\nfew  Inek  who  climbed  the  great  cliffs,  ascending to the world beyond where the people\nthere bestowed upon them great gifts of gold, in exchange for the face of one of [the Inek's]\ngods.”\n\n===Truth Behind the Myth===\nDuring  the reign of the Ynnic King-Emperor Joanseln in the seventh century, the Posvleadi\nchief  Gelinik  is  recorded  to  have  been  sent  by  the priests of Adbrabohvi “on a sacred\nmission  to aid the Emperor”. After Joanseln's assassination, Gelinik pledged his loyalty to\nhis  daughter,  Zeldja  yen Dolin, and aided her against the Rider Assembly at the Battle of\nTromseloc during the First Ynnic Civil War."

At Zeldja's coronation ceremony, the Posvleadi were listed as one of\nthe people she was ruler of. It isn't known whether this meant full citizenship was extended\nto  all  members  of  Gelinik's  tribe,  or  whether  they  would have to live as second-class\ncitizens  like  the  Rzentur  did.  Either  way,  Gelinik  departed  soon  after  the civil war's\nconclusion:\n\n\n\nEven  the  Sarda  word  ''Buycev'',  meaning  warrior  and  which refers by extension to all\nwarrior  peoples  surrounding  the  Ynn,  is similar enough that linguists suspect a common\nroot with Boek.\n\n===Lost and Found===\nMost  Posvleadi  left  the  upper  Ynn  to  follow  Gelinik,  and by the time of Calrodiy I's\ncoronation  no  mention  is  made  of  them  among  the  Ynnic  Empire's  subject peoples.\nSporadic  contact  with the world below remained nonetheless. In 798, Imperial authorities\nwere  able  to  locate the missing head of Filenval's statue through hearsay from a Posvleadi\nwoman visiting Adbrabohvi:\n\n\n\n===The Missing Link?===\n''Doboniwlens'',  meaning "Divine Hair", is a name describing members of the Inek Tribe\nborn  with  natural  dark  blue  hair, a feature unique to their tribe which doesn't appear in\nany  other Boek. The birth of a Doboniwlens is an auspicious event, and they are looked to\nas  quasi-angelical figures. As Sarda Ruinborn Elves are born with the widest variety of hair\ncolours,  among  which  blue is associated with the nobility of Vels Bacar, this gives further\nlegitimacy  to the myth of the Inek being descended from the "heavens", where the heavens\nare  actually  the  Ynn  River  Valley,  and the Doboniwlens's "Divine Hair" is actually the\nancient Posvleadi's Sarda blood resurfacing."

Despite  this,  the region is known in\nCannor and beyond after the city of the same name. Bulwar was the seat of the Castanorian\nCouncil  called  the  Bulwar  Accord, and thus Castanites started the habit of talking about\nthe region by using the city name.\n\n=== Geography ===\n\n==== Sub-regions ====\nBulwar is often divided in 5 regions :\n\n* Bahar: the wooden lands of the Northwest\n* The Harpy Hills: the mountains and hills stretching from the Sad Kuz to Lake Jorkad\n*   Bulwar  Proper:  the  plains  of  the  Suran  from  Brasan  to  Sareyand  along  with  the\nmountains of the Sad Sur\n* Far Bulwar: the upper Suran and Lake Naza lands\n* Far Salahad: arid lands and the Eastern Harpies nests\n\n==== Notable rivers and mountains ====\n\n\nThe  Suran  and  the  Baranun  are  two  biggest  and  most  important  rivers.

For  those  reasons,  Bulwar has strong regional identities, and while most people\nspeak  Standard  Surakeši, a common tongue developed in the mid-1800s between scholars\nof  the  Overclan  and  the  Jadd Empire, languages like Bahari, Gelkar, Mašnsih, Brasanni\nand Akalšesi Zanite remain spoken in their respective regions.\n\nIn  addition  to Bulwar, the Bulwari people and Bulwari descendants can be found in other\nregions, such as the Trollsbay, Cannor and Rahen.\n\n=== Etymology ===\nThe  name  “Surakeši”,  their  endonym, etymologically derives from the word Surakeš, the\nname  of  the subcontinent, that can be translated as Land of the Sun, or as Land of the Sun\nKing,  in  both  cases  referring  to  Surakel,  the  god of worship of the Sun Cult, Bulwar’s\nnative religion.\n\n=== Ethnicity ===\nWhile  "Bulwari"  is  used  to  refer  to  the native humans of Bulwar, this meaning is used\nprimarily  outside  of  Bulwar.  Inside  of  Bulwar, "Bulwari" is used as an ethno-religious\ndenomination  that  includes  any  person  that  lives  in  Bulwar,  shares  common cultural\npractices  and, most importantly, has converted to the Sun Cult.

They\nbelieve  that all gods are dead, with the last god, Surakel, sacrificing himself to become the\nsun  in  order to keep the Malevolent Dark at bay. The followers of the cult seek to protect\nthe Light fighting the Darkness by rejecting lies, sadness and despair, helping the needy and\nmaintaining hope, until the day Surakel returns.\n\nThe  Cult  is  divided  by academics into three main denominations, the Old Sun Cult, the\nNew  Sun  Cult  and  the  Jadd,  being  the last one the dominant denomination in modern\nBulwar.\n\n=== Land Ownership ===\nHistorically,  most of the land in Bulwar was owned and worked by free peasants, who paid\nproperty tax directly to the state.\n\nThis  form  of  land ownership can be traced back to ancient Bulwar, as peasants paid a tax\nto  the  temple  or to the local God-king. With the passage of time, some land ended up in\nthe  hands  of  Gnolls  and  later Sun Elves, but the grand majority of the land remained in\nhuman hands.\n\nDue  to this, Bulwar never experienced the countryside-city migrations in a massive way, as\nhappened  in Cannor, but rather it was a more gradual process, with exceptions such as the\nNaza  plain, which was concentrated in the hands of a few landowners during the Sareyandi\nestate and the Early Jadd Empire."

Families that can\ntrace  direct  descent  from  a  noteworthy  ancestor  are  regarded  as  part of the Barkabti.\nAristocratic  families are generally recognized for the use of family names composed for the\nword  szal-  (Bulwari: Blood of) and the name of an ancestor: E. g. szal-Fazil, szal-Lekad.\nOlder  aristocratic  families,  such  as Gillu-gameš (Those who pray to Gillu) or Araškaysit\n(Scions  of Araš) follow a different naming convention, as the use of szal- was only adopted\nduring the Castanorian Age.\n\nNobility  in  Bulwar doesn’t have associated any privilege, but Barkabti families are usually\nin  control  of  the  state  and  other  institutions, like the Temple. The aristocratic families\nbuild  networks  of  relationships  among  themselves,  using  political  marriages, business\ncontracts,   and   bureaucratic   positions,  which  allows  them  to  keep  control  over  the\nkingdom/city state affairs.\n\nThe  Barkabti  see  the  state  as a patrimony of the nobility, and they consider that they are\nthe  only  ones  capable  of  managing  it. Despite this, the Barkabti are not a closed social\nclass.  If  a  lowborn  bureaucrat  or  promising  merchant draws the attention of one of the\naristocratic  families  due  to his potential, connections or position in the government, they\nwill  try  to  integrate  them  into  their  sphere of influence through marriages, commercial\ncontracts  or  favors.

Polygyny is more common in groups like\nthe  Gelkar  and  the Mašnsih, since those groups historically had a lower number of males\ndue to the harpy kidnappings.\n\nOfficially,  the  Sun  Cult  takes  no  position on the matter, despite being the institution in\ncharge  of  keeping  the  records  of  marriages.  In  practice, the Cult condones any family\nstructure  so  long  as  it  doesn’t  negatively  affect  the  upbringing of the family’s children.\nWhile  multiple  relationships  within  marriage is accepted, adultery, on the other hand, is\nnot.

Famous for their merchants, sailors and for being the only providers of wood\nof the East Divenhal. Most of their population is concentrated around the cities of Aqatbar\nand Re’uyel.\n\nThe  Gelkar  are  the  inhabitants  of  the  Harpy  Hills.  Their millenia-long relation with\nharpies  made  their  society  more  female-leaded  than  other Bulwari cultures. The main\nGelkar settlements are the cities of Gelkalis, Akurmbag and Arkašul.\n\nThe  Kuzarami  are  cousins  of  the  Gelkar  and  they  inhabit the Šad Kuz, the southwest\nmountains  of  the  Harpy Hills. While very similar in culture to their cousins, they have a\ncloser  relation  with  the  Bahari,  since Kuzaram is the only land route between the Suran\nvalley and Bahar. They are known for worshiping Kuza, the mother of Surakel.\n\nThe  Brasanni  live  in  the  Drolas  peninsula  and  the  lower Suran plain. The region was\ntraditionally  divided  into hundreds of city-states that fiercly defended their autonomy, and\nby that reason, the Brasanni have strong local cultures.\n\nThe Zanites inhabit the middle Suran and Naza plains. Their culture was forged during the\nconquest  of  the  region  by  Akalšes,  and by their policy of population movement. Zanite\nculture  is  the  most  known  outside  of  Bulwar,  as  it was the courtly culture of both the\nPhoenix Empire and the Jadd Empire.\n\nThe Surani inhabit the upper Suran plain. Their culture is deply religious, since their lands\nhold  two  of  the most holy places in Bulwar: the temple-city of Eduz-Vacyn and the grand\ntemple of the Jadd of Eduz-Meduru.\n\nThe  Mašnsih inhabit the Salahad desert, they are a semi-nomadic people, mainly nomadic\npastoralists,  but  the  degree  of  settledness varies from tribe to tribe. They also live in the\nmerchant cities of the Gulf of Rahen and the oasis of the Far Salahad."

 page_events.188.d: "\nThe  Age of Cinders is the period of Bulwar's history that succeeds the Age of the Phoenix.\nIt commonly starts in 1162 after the death of Empress Jexis and the fall of her empire, and\nlasts  until the beginning of the Jaddari conquests of the Bulwar plains in 1494, starting the\nAge of the Dancing Sun.\n\nThe  period  is  characterised  by  the  rise  of  the  formers elven governors of the Phoenix\nEmpire  as  local  rulers,  the  consolidation  of their realms into proper kingdoms, and the\nconflicts between them: The Cinder Wars.\n\n==First Cinder War (1162 - 1170)==\nThe  First Cinder War saw the Phoenix Empire implode and carved by the elven governors\nof Bulwar into various kingdoms.\n\n===The Bashed Skull Uprising===\nIn Bulwar, the rule of Jexis was met with apathy and discontent, as the centre of the empire\nonce  again  shifted away from the Bulwar region. In 1161, the old general and governor of\nthe  Upper  Buranun,  Gelmonias  Dalzuir, was murdered in Anbenncóst by his rival Elizar\nthe Blooded. The ones who dared protest to the empress were imprisoned, among them the\ngovernor of Imulšes, Birzartan.\n\nThe  son  of  Gelmonias, Darastarion, and the brother of Birzartan, Eletar, rebelled against\nthe  unjust  policies  of  Jexis  and  her  brother.  An  imperial  army  was  sent to quell the\nrebellion, headed by Elizar lieutenant, Filinar Alarzuir. This soon came to be known as the\nBashed Skull Uprising.\n\n=== Death of the Empress ===\nFilinar  hoped for a quick victory after a series of battles won, however the death of Jexis in\n1162  reshuffled  the  cards.  Opposing  her  bloodthirsty  brother  Elizar,  many governors\njoined  the  rebels,  such  as  Ginerdu,  Sareyand  and Yametšes. Despite the dire situation,\nFilinar remained loyal to Elizar and managed to defeat and slay the governor of Sareyand in\nbattle  before  embarking  on  a western campaign to provide a possible safe landing region\nfor  the  imperial  legions  stuck  in  Cannor.  However,  the brutality of Filinar during the\ncapture  of  the  port  city  of  Anzabad  ended up sparking revolts against the empire in the\nnearby Medurubar and Brasan."

 page_events.1737.d: "\n\n===Changes of Fortune===\nFilinar's  army  suffered  his  first  defeat  in Medurubar after a flood forced him to lift the\nsiege.  His  allies  were  knocked out of the war following their defeat in Kutriq, and Elizar\nwas  slain  during his Cannorian campaign, sparking uncertainty as he was the last member\nof  the  Jaherian  bloodline.  With  little  hope  of  victory  and  no more cause to fight for,\nFilinar  took  his  own life on the banks of the lower Suran in the summer of 1169, ending\nthe war.\n\n===Partition of Kalib===\nAfter  the  war,  the  Phoenix  legions  that  followed Elizar in Cannor retreated to Bulwar.\nTheir  leader, Erelassa, demanded the bulwari governors meet with her in the city of Kalib.\nThere,   she   presented  the  bulwari  governors  an  infant  by  the  name  of  Jaddar,  and\nproclaimed  him  as  the  heir  of  Jexis.  At  her  dismay,  all rejected her claim aside from\nVulzin, governor of Elizna and fervent member of loyalists.\n\nThe  initial  meeting  was followed by long negotiations during which the victors of the war\ndrafted  the  Partition  of  Kalib  :  The Empire is declared forfeit and Jaddar was officially\ndismissed  as  possible  heir.  The  various  governors  and  Taelarios  (who  still lacked an\nofficial  title)  acknowledged  each others as Kings of their demesnes, cementing the end of\nthe  Empire.  From  the  old  governorships appeared the kingdoms of Dalarand, Sareyand,\nRe’uyel and Birzartanšes.\n\n==The Flickering Peace (1170 - 1258)==\n\n===Re'uyel's Expansion in Busilar===\nFollowing  the  death  of  Jexis  Busilar  was  divided into two parties: those who supported\nJexis' brutal half-brother Elizar the Blooded along with sun elf rule and those who wanted a\nfree  Busilar.  The  lines  were again broken after Elizar's defeat, with the country split into\nvarious  feudal  lords.  Using her wealth and fleet, Uyel sailed to Port Jaher and rallied the\ncity council around her in 1178, following the assassination of the former Sun Elf governor\nTranduir.  Uyel  began  to  arbitrate between the various warlords of Businor, ensuring that\nthe  Interregnum  continued  with  no  united Busilar to confront her on the Divenhal. The\nInterregnum  would  however  end  in  1224  when  the  Silnaras  took  the  title of King of\nBusilar,  but  negotiated  with  the  son  of  Uyel,  Kalinael  that  Port  Jaher would remain\nRe'uyeli."

Wary\nof  heretic  tendencies in a city so strategic, Taelarios of Irrliam moved in with his personal\nguard  composed  of  the  Order  of  the  Zenith  to  root  out the heretics in 1220. Having\nexposed  links  between  the  Judges  ruling Medurubar and the Cultists, he proclaimed the\nannexation  of  Medurubar  and  installed  his court in the city, overseeing the judgments of\nheretics  and  their death on the pyres in what would later be called the Medurubari Purge.\nAmongst the notable clerics who escaped the purge was the young Ashuru szal Harumanz.\n\n===Sareyand's Eastern Campaigns===\nLike  the  rest  of  the  Kings  of  Bulwar, Eledas II Sarelzuir tried to enhance his power by\nannexing  more  territories  in  the  East. Chronicles tell of his intent to secure the Salahad\nand  plan  a  new  Raheni  campaign.  For  a  while, his successes against the Gnolls of the\nHarad  oasis  and  beyond  gave  credit  to the idea. But despite his best efforts, he suffered\ndefeat  against Celador of Azka-Sur who had allied with the Dwarves of Seghdhir and some\nMasnish tribes, leading to Eledas being forced to fall back to the fortress of Hasr in 1256.\n\n===Divisions in the Cult===\nTaelarios  worked to uniformize the Sun Cult teachings well beyond his demesne. In 1201,\nthe  Rabsukal  of  Brasan  hosted an assembly of the various priests in the city, with notably\nthe  three  Kašra  of  the  Suran  (Bulwar,  Eduz-Vacyn  and  Azka-Sur)  at  the  demand of\nTaelarios.   There   the  doctrine  of  shared  divinity  he  had  put  forward  in  Kalib  was\nacknowledged  as canon law : with the death of Jaher’s bloodline, his divinity was passed to\nall the Sun Elves who had the moral duty to protect the Cult and thus the Light.\n\nHowever  by  1252,  the  unity  of the Cult was in danger as the new High Kašra of Bulwar\nwas  succeeded  by  the  charismatic  and  militant  Basir, friend and advisor of the King of\nDalarand,  who  was  renowned  throughout  Bulwar  for  his  militant  doctrine, seeing the\nsplintering  of  the Empire as an action that only bolstered the Malevolent Dark. As one of\nthe  three  Kasra  of  the  Suran,  he  began  to  attack the Council of Brasan and especially\nTaelarios,  who  found  an  ally  in  the  Kasra  of  Eduz-Vacyn,  under  the  control  of  his\nbrother-in-law, Eledas II."

Arantir was a vain and envious ruler while\nKaltan  was seen as charismatic and ambitious, attracting the ire of his liege. Tensions grew\nhigher as time went on, and messengers from both Darastarion of Dalarand and Kalinael of\nRe'uyel  were  seen  by  agents of the paranoiac Arantir in the port of Aqatbar where Eletar\nwas  promised  independence  in  exchange  for  his  support in the war to come in Bulwar.\nKalinael  and  Darastarion  commited  to  another  secret  pact  to  divide  Bulwar between\nthemselves,  with  Kalinael promising the hand of his sister Veharia to cement the pact and\nEletar being confirmed as a future vassal of Kalinael.\n\n==Second Cinder War (1258 - 1272)==\n\n===The campaign of the Young Phoenix===\nDarastarion  of Dalarand had observed his fellow neighbors embroiled in wars and internal\nconflicts  for  years.  The  defeat  of  Eledas  II  and  the  perceived  weakness of Arantir of\nBirsartanses  prompted  him  to  declare  war  on  his  rivals  with  the intent to reunify the\nPhoenix  Empire.  He  could  count  on  the support of the Temple of Bulwar, ruled by his\nfriend  Basir  and  the general Kalindil Varamzuir, a veteran of the Halessi campaigns. His\nforces  are  divided  into  two  main  armies, one he leads personally against Taelarios, and\nanother led by his lieutenant Kalindil Varamzuir against Sareyand.\n\nDarastarion  won  a  great  victory  in  Zansap  against  Taelarios  while  Kalindil  besieges\nSareyand.  However,  the  Harpy  sense  weakness  and  began harassing the supply lines of\nDarastarion,  forcing  him  to  engage the clans in battle and diverting him from seizing the\nmomentum and crush Taelarios. Sensing a loss of momentum, Darastarion proclaimed that\nthe  Bulwari  cities  would  gain  further  autonomy  in  his Empire in the hopes to increase\nsupport  for  his  cause while Taelarios of Irrliam painted Darastarion and Basir as servants\nof Darkness and stirred the Cult against them."

However when his troops reached the Sad Kuz passes, he\nlearns  of  the  treason of his cousin Kaltan : the ruler of Baharkand declared independence\nwith  the  help  of  the  kingdom  of Re’uyel which intended to increase their influence over\nthem  and  have more control over the forests of Bahar (for shipbuilding). The grandson of\nKaltan, the future Kaltan III Eletarzuir is promised to the daughter of Kalinael, Selusia. As\nBaharkandi  and  Re’uyeli  forces  began  to  advance  into  Birsartansesi  territory.  Arantir\ndecided  to  prioritize  the war in Bulwar proper and decides to accept the independence of\nhis cousin for the time being, with the treaty of Fajabahar in 1261.\n\n===The Azkabar uprising (1262-1263)===\nThe  prison  of  Azkabar,  under  the  supervision  of the Kingdom of Dalarand, had hosted\nmagi  since the reign of Jexis, and only a few were rumored to have escaped since then. But\nin  1262,  Old Cultists rose in the city and liberated the magi declaring that the war among\nthe  elves  showed  the lies of the ‘heretical elven cult’. Fearing a general uprising, Kalindil\nwas tasked by Darastarion to abandon the city of Sareyand to put down the revolt. Kalindil\nwould  takes  back the city of Azkabar after one year of siege, which had been prulunged by\nthe  numerous  magicians  in  the  revolt,  and  commit  a  bloodbath  as  all magicians and\nheretics were either thrown into the Prison of Azkabar once more or killed.\n\n===The Western advance (1262-63)===\nArantir  crossed  the  Sad  Kuz  in  1262 and joined with Taelarios to fight Darastarion. In\nAnzarxax,  on  the  banks  of the Buranun, the king of Dalarand managed to gain the upper\nhand in combat until the mercenaries he had hired switched sides and forced him to fight a\npyrrhic  victory  over  his  foes.  Darastarion  prefered  to  retreat  to  Bulwar after growing\nsuspectful of Re’uyeli intrigues, which were confirmed after Kalinael broke the engagement\nof  his  sister to let her marry a local elven noble. However Taelarios and Arantir’s alliance\nwas short lived as they end up fighting each other to get to Bulwar first."

The plot by Kalindil Varamzuir\ncaught the ‘young Phoenix’ by surprise. He died assassinated in the city of Bulwar where he\nhad  retreated  and  gathered  his forces, Galindil having killed him while he was resting in\nhis  bath.  Varamzuir  took  over the realm of the Buranun but was not recognized by many\nDarastarion  loyalists  nor  by  any  other  King  of  the  Phoenix  Estates in Bulwar besides\nKalinael.\n\nBasir  who  denounced the murder of his former King was attacked by Crathanori agents of\nKalinael  smuggled  by  the Twelves in the temple of Bulwar. When he fled into the streets\nhe  was  mocked  and  attacked  by  the people of the city who blamed him for the war. He\nmanaged to flee east, and was not heard again in Bulwar proper.\n\n===The Years of Hunger (1264-72)===\nThe  death  of  Darastarion did not mean the end of the war, for Kalindil tried to secure an\nindependent  realm  for  his dynasty over the ruins of his former liege, while having to fight\nSareyand,  Irliam  and  Birzartanses.  However,  the various belligerents were forced to end\nlarge  campaigns  following  the  great  famine of 1265, provoked by the large disruption of\nagriculture  by  the  war  and  the destruction of several irrigation systems during the fights.\nThe  famine  killed  thousands  of  Bulwaris  throughout  the Suran, hitting even the city of\nBrasan who had remained neutral. In the city of Bulwar, the new government of the Twelve\nfamilies  estimated that a quarter of the inhabitants of the city died of hunger or by diseases\nthat  struck  the  already  weakened  population.  Out  of  the various belligerents, Kalindil\ndeveloped  hit  and  run  strategy  of  small  cavalry  units  that  raided  the countryside and\navoided the fortified cities. While he was successful in managing to secure his realm on the\nUpper  Buranun by disrupting the war capacity of his enemies he also gained the nickname\nof  the  "Red  Pretender"  because  of  the  blood  he  spilled  all  over  the  Suran with his\nchevauchées."

Their growing influence over Brasan didn't\nmeet   much   resistance   either:   they   deposed  the  Rabsukal  of  Brasan  after  dubious\naccusations  of  him  being  a  former  supporter of Darastarion surfaced, and replaced him\nwith  a  puppet  of theirs. Influence over the republic grew steadily in the following decade,\nuntil the Rabsukal formally swore fealty to the king of Re'uyel in 1285.\n\n===Influence over Bahar===\nWith the estuary of the Suran under their control, Re'uyel worked on restoring trade in the\neastern  Divenhal  sea, after it was greatly disrupted by the recent conflicts. King Kalinael I\nordered  the  construction  of  a  grand  merchant fleet, as well as the construction of a new\nmilitary  fleet  to protect their interests. To secure the needed supplies, they turned towards\nBaharkand  and  its  dense  forests.  The latter had no choice but to answer the increasingly\nridiculous  demands  of  Kalinael,  as  Re'uyel  was  the only realm willing to protect them\nagainst the threat posed by the Kingdom of Birzartanšes.\n\nWith  the  great  merchant  fleet  built,  trade in the eastern Divenhal boomed yet again, to\nlevels  similar  as the time of the Phoenix Empire. The cannorian high demand for bulwari\nand  raheni  goods,  such  as silk, spices and porcelain made Re'uyel's entreprise extremely\nlucrative,  making  Kalinael I the richest individual of this part of world. Other individuals\nin  the  realms  also made great profits, such as the Crathanori merchants who were able to\nestablish  commercial ties more easily with the Cannorian thanks to their identical religion\nand shared heritage with the Busilari.\n\n===Ventures into Ourdanor===\nAt the turn of the century, Kalinel looked at using his wealth to expand his realm. Isolated,\nthe  Petty  Kingdom  of  Ourdia  appeared  as an easy target and an invasion was launched.\nHowever,  Kalinael's forces were unable to take the great citadel of Bal Ourd after years of\nsiege.

Soon after\nmining  operations  started, Re'uyel started to demand a share of the revenues. Exasperated\nby  this  incident  as  well  as  multiple  previous  ridiculous  demands,  King  Kaltan  I  of\nBaharkand  started  to  actively  oppose  the  growing  influence of Re'uyel. Secret ties with\ncountries  wary  of Re’uyel’s naval and mercantile hegemony were established, including the\nelven  kingdoms  of  Irrliam  and Elizna, the dwarven hold of Ovdal Tûngr, and the human\nkingdoms of Ourdia and Busilar.\n\nKaltan's  plan  was ready to be set in motion by 1302. War on Re'uyel was declared - soon\nfollowed  by  the  other  members of the secret coalition - and the part of the Re’uyeli navy\nthat  was  docked  in  Aqatbar for maintenance was promptly seized. Despite their superior\nnumbers, the coalition still experienced setbacks at sea, but managed to keep the tide of the\nwar in their favour nonetheless, thanks to numerous victories on land.\n\nIn  response,  Re'uyel  entered  into an alliance with the Kingdom of Birzartanšes, allowing\nthem  to  isolate Kaltan's force in Bahar. The support of the Ekhani fleet was negotiated as\nwell to blockade Busilar and prevent any form of reinforcements from reaching Bahar.\n\nThe  tide  turned  yet  again  after the Kingdom of Eborthíl, afraid of the consequences of a\nRe'uyeli   victory,   entered   the  war  on  the  coalition's  side.  They  managed  to  finally\noverwhelm their opponent at sea and on land, forcing Re'uyel to sue for peace in 1311.\n\n===Treaty of Gemisle===\nThe  following  peace  talks  took  place  on  the  island  of  Gemisle.  Irrliam received the\nbirzartanšesi  territories  south of the Šad-Kuz as well as the title of “protectors of Brasan",\nto the dismay of Elizna, who only obtained control of the Drolas peninsula for their efforts.\nBaharkand  got  the  territories  Re’uyel seized from Baharšes a century prior. Ovdal Tûngr\ntook  back  the  mountains  surrounding  their  hold,  including  the  lucrative gold mine of\nGulangor."

The  former  considered  herself  cheated after only receiving the poorly\ndeveloped  Drolas  Peninsula  despite  largely  contributing the most ships to the coalition’s\nfleet. She supposedly entered a fury when the Irrliami princess retorted that the Drolas was\nmore than sufficient for a country fully responsible for the naval defeats that nearly cost the\nwar.\n\n==Century of Shimmers (1311 - 1413)==\nThe  Third  Cinder  War  was the last large scale conflict that ignited between multiple sun\nelf  states.  With the last two potential hegemons put down by a coalition, no state dared to\ntake  their  chance  at  unifying  the  region.  This  led  to  a  period  of overall peace, only\noccasionally disturbed by smaller and more localised conflicts.\n\n===Eliznan Syncretism===\nThe  elven  supremacist  faction  of  Elizna  was greatly weakened after the war, the core of\ntheir power centred around the recently sunken navy. Queen Zelaria seized the opportunity\nto  cut  them  off  completely  from  power,  and  started  a  series of reforms that aimed at\nincorporating  Kheteratan  customs  into  the Eliznan high society to stabilize her ruler over\nthe region.\n\n===Fall of the Šad Sur===\nAfter  gradually  losing ground to more and more persistant gnollish attacks during the past\ncentury,  the  Akalate  of  the  Šad Sur finally fell after a massive gnollish pack broke in the\nfortress-capital  of  Ekluzagnu.  Irrliami  aid  came  too  late to save the Kingdom, but still\nmanaged  stop  the  gnollish  advance and secure the refugees' safety. After relocating to the\nsafer  territory  of  Zanšap,  the Šad Sur Akal pledged allegiance to the Irrliazuir dynasty in\nexchange for protection against future attacks."

While  initially  successful,  the fierce resistance mounted by the\nharpies  made  the  campaigns extremely costly in manpower, and the conquered territories\nended  up  being  even  costlier to hold in the long run. In the end, the campaigns archived\nthe  opposite  objective,  and  kickstarted the events that would lead to the resurgence of an\nunified harpy realm.\n\nThe  first  major  setback  happened when Ishtara - the matriarch of a modestly sized harpy\nflock  - managed to defeat an invading Varamhari army near Arkašul, at a battle that would\nlater  be  known  as  the  Ishtara  swoop. She then used her newly found popularity to raise\nunity  among the harpies and rallied the flocks into a combined attack against Gelkalis and\nBirzartanšes.  With  the  Birzartanšesi armies exhausted and overextended, the harpies were\nable  to  retake  a  significant portion of the hills, at the cost of Ishtara's life. Her daughter,\nMudam,  used  her  mother's  heroic status to fully unify the flocks in 1342, birthing a new\nQueendom of Harpylen.\n\n===Founding of the Jadd Faith===\n\nMeanwhile,  in  the Easternmost part of the region, Jaddar Jexiszuir finally descended from\nthe  Mountain  of  Clear  Sight  in  the  summer  of  1333,  after 9 years of seclusion. This\nmoment  is  generally considered as the founding act of the Jadd faith, a religion that would\ngreatly shake the region in the following centuries.\n\nThe  legend  goes  that Jaddar went into seclusion after reading the texts of the Kašra Basir,\nnicknamed  "the  old man of Bulwar" by the Mašnsih after he fled Dalarand and went into\nexile.  These  texts  supposedly  held  a  certain  influence on the future Herald, for he was\ninspired  by  the man's speeches about the need to fight the Darkness, and the need for one\nempire to spread the Light."

Many started to gravitate around\nTaelarios,  who  was preaching for a more structured, centralised and radical version of the\nSun  Cult in response. Galvanised by his growing number of followers, Taelarios abdicated\nthe  Irrliam  throne  to  his  eldest  daughter,  Imariel, to focus on unifying the cult around\nhimself.\n\nHis  attempt  was  only  partially  successful.  He  managed  to make the Irrliami capital of\nMedurubar  the  new center of the cult (notably by using intimidation tactics carried by the\nOrder  of the Zenith on the historically important temples of Bulwar and Eduz-Vacyn), and\nmany  practices  were  codified  and  regulated  during  this  period.  However, he failed to\nnegotiate the unification of local temples under the same organisation during the council of\nIdanaš,  with  every other elven kingdom opposing the idea of losing control over their own\nclergy.\n\nTaelarios' actions also had the effect of reinforcing the animosity between the Irrliazuir and\nVulzinzuir   dynasties,   with   his   hard-line  policies  frequently  clashing  against  Elizna’s\nsyncretistic approach towards the beliefs of their Kheteratan subjects.\n\n===The Shimmering Palaces===\nDuring  this  period, the elven nobility started to drift more and more away from the rest of\nthe  bulwari  society,  secluding  themselves  in their palaces. Boredom was chased away by\nlavish  balls,  artistic  expositions  and  scientific  curiosities,  and  the  many wealthy elven\npatrons  hiring  talented  artists  and scholars ushered a small golden age in their respective\nfields.  Among  the  more  ambitious  projects  of  the  period  were the construction of the\nEduz-Rakadagh of Bulwar, as well as the renovations of the great library of Aqatbar.\n\nThe  financing  of  the  sun  elven  luxurious  way  of life was secured by neglecting military\nspending and increasing taxes on the peasantry. While the cult played a key role at ensuring\nthe  general  discontent  was kept at an acceptable level, by the start of the 15th century the\nstrain on the bulwari populace was at an all time high."

Tax income\nplummeted,  while  at the same time kings were forced to buy grain from abroad to prevent\nfood  riots.  Peasants  turned  to  crime  to  feed  their  families  in  neglected  regions, and\nincompetent  responses  from  the  elven  monarchs  decreased  the  trust  placed  in them.\nSuccession  wars  between  the kingdoms of Re'uyel, Baharkand and Birzartanšes worsened\nthe  situation  even  further,  and  let  to  rebellions  in  the  Harpy  Hills and secessions in\nCrathanor.\n\nThe  general  chaos opened the way to the Goblin Exodus, a horde of goblins that came out\nthe  Serpentreach  mountains  and  swept  through  Bahar. The Kingdom of Baharkand was\ncompletely  destroyed  while  the  other  realms barely managed to hold them. The goblins\neventually  converged  under  the  Marblehead  clan  and  slowly integrated into the region.\nTheir  new  realm  they  established  around  the  border of the late kingdom of Baharkand\nwould latter became known as the Aqatbar Overclan.\n\n\n===War of the Ember Queens===\nSince the Treaty of Gemisle, Brasan became the center point of the rivalry between Irrliam\nand  Elizna,  with  the  latter  often  trying  to  meddle with the Brasanni elections. Elizna's\nefforts   came   to   fruition   in   1417,   when   the   high   council   of  Brasan  elected  a\npro-independence  Rabsukal.  After  Irrliam  unsuccessfully tried to have the new Rabsukal\nremoved,  Brasan declared their independence with Elizna’s backing, starting the War of the\nEmber Queens."

The  walls  of  the  capital - Medurubar -\nmanaged  to  hold for 28 months, but the long siege only increase the wrath of the invaders\nand the city was brutally sacked and most of the royal family murdered.\n\nIronically  this  tragic  event  was what saved Irrliam from a total defeat. Elizna suffered an\nintense  backlash  from  the  other  bulwari  leaders,  particularly  the ones who lost family\nmembers  in  the  massacre.  Multiple  countries  threatened to enter the war against them,\nwhich forced Zelaria to sue for peace with Irrliam. Elizna ended up giving back the control\nof  the cities of Medurubar and Anzabad, but kept control of the other occupied territories.\nThe  Brasani  Rabsukal  was  deposed  and  the city remained under Irrliami influence, but\nobtained much more autonomy.\n\n===Gnollish Resurgence===\nThe  weakening  of  the elven states paved the way for a gnollish resurgence in Bulwar, after\ncenturies  of  being  confined  the  Salahad  desert. The movement was spearheaded by two\nleaders  who  managed  to  subjugate  surrounding  packs  thanks  to  their magical powers:\nTluuk in the Šad Sur and Zokka around the Harra Oasis.\n\nZokka  was  the  first  to  take action, and attacked the kingdom of Sareyand in 1426. King\nEledas  was  ambushed  thanks  to clever gnollish tactics and lost his left arm during a duel\nwith  the gnoll leader. The limb was allegedly eaten by Zokka, which is often the tale given\nto explain his moniker “Devourer of Suns”. After the battle, the remaining sareyandi forces\nretreated  to  their  core  territories  while  Hašr  and Eduz-Vacyn became tributaries of the\ngnolls.\n\nIn   the   Šad   Sur   meanwhile,  Tluukt  managed  to  finish  the  subjugation  of  the  last\nindependent  local  packs  by  1434.  Judging  correctly  that  Irrliam  would not be able to\nintervene  after  the  events  of  the  War of the Ember Queens, she then launched an attack\nagainst  Zanšap  to  drive  them out completely of their remaining mountainous territories.\nEmboldened  by  her victories, she continued her advance towards to city of Bulwar, which\nrecently  conquered  by  the  powerful  mage and king of Varamhar, Carodir I. Sensing the\noverflowing  pride  of her opponent, Tluuk challenged Carodir to a magic duel she soundly\nwon, allowed her to seize the city with minimal loses."

The human and elves armies were defeated again however,\nand  King  Erlian  of  Azka-Sur  lost  his  life  while protecting a convoy of refugees fleeing\nHašr.\n\n=== A Fire Ignites the East===\nZokka's  success  wouldn't  last  long  however.  His  undoing wouldn't come from the sun\nelves  in  the  West  but  from  Jaddari  legions  in  the  east,  during the Battle of the Sun's\nProvidence  in  1446.  Jaddar  personally sought a duel against the gnollish leader and slew\nhim  in  front  of  all  of his troops. His death shattered the gnolls' spirit, provoking a mass\nrout  and  ending  the  war.  With  the  help  of  Zokka's  son  -  latter be known as Zokka\nDevourer-of-Darkness  -  who  surrendered  and  converted to the Jadd after the battle, the\nremaining  gnolls  were forcefully assimilated, after having been given the choice to convert\nor  die.  The  Akalate  of  Hašr  was  liberated  and  their  Akal proclaimed Jaddar as their\nsaviour and promptly converted to the Jadd faith.\n\nAfter  securing a quick victory over Sareyand which saw him proclaimed as the protector of\nthe  lupper  Suran,  Jaddar  turned  his  gaze  towards  the  east. Successful campaigns were\nlaunched  against  the  Siadan  Harpies  in  1453,  Azka-Sur in 1454, the Gold Dwarves in\n1462  and  a  join  invasion  of  coastal  Rahen  with  Bhuvauriin 1469.

As chaos descended on the elven realms, the eastern legions were mobilised,\nand  the invasion was kickstarted in 1493. Less than a year latter, Sareyand had completely\ncapitulated, unable to muster any worthy opposition to the Jaddari legion.\n\nThe fall of Sareyand in 1494 cemented the rise of Jaddar and the fall from grace of the Sun\nElves.  With  the balance of powers completely reshuffled, most chroniclers mark this year\nas  the  end  of  the  Age  of  Cinders and the start of the Age of the Dancing Sun, although\nsome prefer to separate them with the Proclamation of Bulwar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

 page_events.189.d: "\nThe  Age  of  Monsters  is  a  period of time in Bulwari history from the fall of Karqašlu in\n1134  BA  to  the  death  of  Castan  II  in  568 BA. It describes the rise of the subsequent\nmonstrous  dominions  and invasions of Bulwar, starting with the Harpy Queendom, which\nis  followed  by  the  invasion  of  the  gnolls  and their four century long influence over the\nregion.  It  culminates  in  the  Great  Xhaz  and  the  Xhazobine's  wars  in and around the\nSalahad  to  spread  a  new demonic cult, until she finally falls to the Castanorians and they\nestablish their influence over Bulwar.\n\n=== The Harpy Queendom ===\nThe  Harpy  Queendom was established during the Onslaught. A document from 1159 BA\ndescribes  the  declaration  of  the  sovereign  Harpy Queendom by Firanya. She is the first\nharpy  according  to  some  legends. While that is not certain, there are no earlier recorded\ninstances  of  harpies,  except  a  text  from around the same time, warning travellers in the\nhills  of Northern Bulwar of attacks by winged women. But despite this lack of evidence of\nprevious  presence,  this  young  harpy  state  came  to  dominate  those hills within a short\nperiod  of  time.  As  such  that  region  is  known  as  the Harpy Hills to this day. It is not\nsurprising  that  they  managed  to  dominate there, as the region is a myriad of crags, cliffs\nand  rocky  outcroppings.  Human settlement in the region had only existed around the few\nwider  valleys  and  the  high  lakes,  while  the harpies built their roosts far out of reach of\npotential  enemies.  That  is  not  to  say  they pushed out the local human population. The\nall-female  race  needed humans males to reproduce, and so the lakes and valleys remained\nsettled by the Bulwari.\n\nThey  didn’t  only  dominate  in the hills. The city-states of Bulwar were forced to pay them\ntribute.  There  is no written evidence of why, but later evidence suggests this was two-fold.\nHarpies  in later times would raid all throughout the Bulwari plains. It seems reasonable to\nassume  that  the  early  Bulwari  cities  were  under  this  threat also. A regular payment of\ntribute  seems  much  less harmful than frequent raids. Additionally, the harpies controlled\nInvader’s  Pass,  and  so  they  had  direct  control over the movement of people and armies\nfrom  the  Forbidden  Plains  to  Bulwar. They must have used this as a method to threaten\nthe  Bulwari  city-states into paying their tribute. One instance in which they made good on\nthis threat was in 1116 BA, 18 years after the fall of Karqašlu. After an extended period of\ntime  of  no tribute, the harpies let in another group of nomads from the Forbidden Plains.\nThe  main  damage  was dealt to the cities around Lake Naza, before the group moved west\nand  devastated  several cities along the Baranun. Finally they settled along the depopulated\ncoast of Bulwar, founding the city of Anzabad."

 page_events.1752.d: "\n\n=== The Cult of Surakel ===\nThe  oldest  records  of  Faith  in  Bulwar describe the war between the forces of Light and\nDarkness. After this war the only god that remained was Surakel, who sacrificed himself to\nbecome   the  sun.  The  sun  had  been  a  popular  motif  all  throughout  the  age  of  the\nGod-Kings, however it appears during the empire of Karqašlu it attained a religious aspect.\nThe myth as it has been passed down to us suggests that the Bulwari once worshipped many\ngods,  but  no  sites  of  worship  have  been  found.  The  oldest  temple  sites are those of\nSurakel.  The  general  consensus  among  modern  scholars  is  that during the time of the\nGod-Kings  the  people  of  Bulwar  worshipped  their  rulers  as  divine  beings. Which is\npartially  why  we  use  that  term for them. It is highly likely that the story of Surakel is an\nagglomeration  of  many misremembered stories that were conjoined into one. Possibly the\nworship  of the sun was brought in by the proto-Zabatlari invaders, as it is in the palaces of\nKarqašlu  that we first see the sun motif gain a religious aspect. The War in the story could\nrefer to a war between God-Kings or between them and the Genies. The similarity between\nBrasan  the  Emancipator and Surakel rising up to save the people of Bulwar should also be\nnoted.  Finally  the aspects of darkness echoes the attacks during the Onslaught and the sun\nas  saviour  of  the people can be found back in the Battle of Brasan as recounted by Thirec\nthe Younger. Though his account cannot be considered as reliable.\n\nRegardless of its origins, we see the Cult of Surakel solidify during the 11th century BA. A\nseries of temples appear all throughout Bulwar, with some of the largest ones being built in\nthe  cities  of Bulwar, Eduz-Vacyn and Azka-Sur. The city of Bulwar especially found itself\nin  a  primary  role  within the religion, housing the high priests of the faith. The priests of\nBulwar  retain  a  certain  primacy  over  those  of  other cities until this day. The Sun Cult\nbecame  a  religion  of  hope  for the coming of a better time. This is a message they would\ncarry  with them throughout the centuries, but their situation would become worse before it\nbecomes better.\n\n=== The Gnollish Invasion ==="
 page_events.1753.t: "Bulwari Age of Monsters 3 / 15"
 page_events.1753.d: "\nIn  997  BA  a  large  host of gnolls under the leadership of one Rakhor invaded Kheterata.\nThey  would  do  great  damage  to  the  kingdom  that had not yet fully recovered after the\nOnslaught,  until  they  were  defeated  in the Battle of Anarat in 984 BA. After 13 years of\nrampaging   through  Kheterata  they  had  looted  most  of  the  valuables  from  the  river\nkingdom,  so  instead  the remaining horde moved east to Bulwar. The city-states were still\nweak and poor, paying most of their excess wealth in tribute to the Harpy Queendom. They\nwere  wholly  unprepared  for  the  tidal wave of gnolls sweeping away their defenses. There\nwas  little  to  no  resistance  as  the  horde  plundered  city  after city, taking valuables and\ncondemning  great  parts  of  the population to slavery. Within a year the band had split up\ninto three smaller groups which each came to establish their own domain.\n\nIn  Bahar,  Uak  the Tremendous founded the Tremendous Kingdom of Uak. Gnolls had a\npenchant  for  giving  themselves  grand  titles  and  it  is likely that this title was as much a\nself-aggrandizement  as  the  naming  of his kingdom. This is something that returns for the\nnaming  of  the  other two kingdoms. Uak’s domain covered Bahar from the gates of Ovdal\nTûngr  to  Kaboustraz,  exacting  tribute  from  the slowly repopulating region, while at the\nsame  time  freeing  them  from  the  harpies.  The  western  part  of  Bahar  was under the\nprotection  of  the  Tûngric  dwarves,  and while Uak initially hoped to rule over the entire\nregion, he could not break the dwarven fortress.\n\nIn  the  mountains  to the south the gnolls find an abandoned Bulwari fortress. There, their\nleader  Zehia  founds  the  Eternal  and  All-High  Kingdom  of  Zehia.  Her  pack quickly\nexpands  its  dominion  over  the  mountains  and  the  adjacent coast. It controls the lower\nreaches of the Suran as well as becomes the overlord and protector of the slowly rebuilding\nBrasan.  Ever  the  opportunists,  they  see the potential of the city and put to use the slaves\nthey  captured  during  their  plundering of the city-states. Soon the city is rebuilt and trade\nbegins  to  visit  the  mouth  of  the Suran. This new commerce mainly revolves around the\ntrade of slaves, something that the gnollish overlords of the city excel at.\n\nOn  the  plains  of  Bulwar the matriarch Proxacha founded her kingdom, the Ever-Greater\nTrue  Gnoll  Kingdom  of  Proxacha.  At  the site where the sun elves later built the city of\nSareyand,  the  gnolls took over the ruins of an old Djinn palace and built the Ever-Greater\nTrue  Gnoll  Palace  of  Proxacha over it. From there she and her successors terrorized the\ncity-states of the Bulwari plains. The states of central and far Bulwar all paid them tribute.\nAnd  soon  the  Proxacha  Eklu, Proxacha’s Palace, transformed into a gilded hall where the\ngnolls  lived  in luxury while being served by thousands of slaves. It is also during this time\nthat  the gnolls established themselves in the eastern Salahad and they took over many trade\nroutes  that had previously existed between Rahen and Bulwar. Their position on this trade\nroute also meant a great source of wealth for the Proxachan gnolls."
 page_events.1754.t: "Bulwari Age of Monsters 4 / 15"
 page_events.1754.d: "\n\nDuring  later  times  the  tales  of  success  from  these kingdoms would attract many more\ngnolls  to  come  up  north  from  Sarhal  in  order  to join in their success. But before that\nhappened  there  was  still a great deal to be fought over. While initially the packs when off\nand  did  their  own  thing,  as soon as their territories got established they started to clash.\nZehia   learned   early   to   rely  on  forts  and  fortifications  and  had  used  them  in  her\nentrenchment  into  the  mountains  and  the  rebuilding  of  Brasan  and her other, smaller\ntributaries,  so  wars  between  her  and  her competitors consisted mainly of them trying to\ntake  her  things  and she easily outlasting them. In turn she made few attempts at claiming\nterritory  of  her  own from the other two kingdoms. Instead she watched and waited as the\nFirst Uaki-Proxachan war broke out, in which the two gnolls fought over domination of the\nlower  Bulwari  city-states. From 980 BA to 975 BA the packs waged war, until by the end\nthe  line  was  drawn  and  Proxacha claimed domination of most of the inland cities, while\nUak’s  domain  came  to  revolve around the Gulf of Glass, which was not yet called that at\nthat  time.  Later,  other  small gnollish kingdoms would appear and some of the city states\nwould  thrive  as  independent  states. But the three kingdoms founded in the early years of\nthe Age remained dominant for centuries.\n\n=== Life During the Age of Monsters ===\nIn  the  three  centuries  that  the  gnolls  had the final say in what happened in Bulwar, the\nsociety  saw  a  gradual  shift. The first century saw a growing gnollish presence. Especially\nthe  kingdoms  of Zehia and Proxacha received a large amount of immigrants from south of\nthe  Salahad.  But  while  the  gnolls  in Bulwar changed Bulwari society, they were in turn\nchanged  by  their  surroundings.  Especially the gnolls that arrived in the later stadia of the\nimmigration noticed that difference. Where in the south they were clearly tribal and would\nfight and raid one another and their human neighbours for slaves and glory, in the north the\npacks  had  made  way  for kingdoms, and matriarchs made way for queens. Uak’s kingdom\nsaw  the  greatest  integration  of  gnolls and locals, possibly because it retained a relatively\nlow  amount  of  gnolls  compared  to  the  other  two  kingdoms. There especially gnollish\nslavers  worked  alongside  Bulwari colleagues to capture their merchandise and to practise\ntheir  trade. Uaki raiders were seen all along the coasts of the Northern Divenhal. The city\nof  Anzabad became a main trading port for the Uaki raiders and it overtook Brasan swiftly\nduring  this  time,  prompting that city’s merchants to shift their trade to revolve around the\nexotic goods that made their way down the Suran from Rahen."

 page_events.1755.d: "\n\nAmidst  the gnollish rule of Bulwar the Cult of Surakel remained strong. Especially among\nthe  lower  rungs  of  society  the message of hope and return of their sun god was popular.\nSlaves  looked  forward to their freedom, while peasants sought a way out of the heavy taxes\nthat  the  greedy  gnolls  laid  upon  them.  Its  main  temples  were  closed,  the  buildings\nconverted  to  palaces  and  shrines  of the gnolls’ old religion. The main place it retained a\nclear  public  position  was  in  Azka-Szel-Azka  which  was under control by Ovdal Tûngr.\nBulwar  in  this  time  was  a  harsh country, but not one without virtues. The strongest and\nmeanest  survived, be it gnoll, dwarf, harpy or human. And so, while in the first years after\nthe  gnollish  invasion  the  region  was controlled by them for the vast majority, soon some\ncity-states,  those  controlled  by  the  baddest  human  kings,  would be able to retain their\nindependence for long stretches of time.\n\n=== Changes of the Middle of the Age ===\nWhile  the  Age  of  Monsters  covers  the span of the existence of the gnollish kingdoms of\nUak,  Proxacha  and  Zehia  in  Bulwar,  it  was  by no means a static period. Especially in\nmiddle  of  the  age,  but certainly not exclusively, there were several great shifts that meant\nthat  by  the end of the Age Bulwar was a much different place than it was at the start of the\nAge.  The  after  the  deaths  of  the  founders  of the kingdoms, the extent of the control of\nProxacha  and Uak receded. Zehia’s kingdom would remain more stable, though it also saw\nits  own  infighting. The Drolas peninsula saw the appearance of a small gnollish kingdom,\nwhile  gnolls  in the Far Salahad found that Proxacha could do little to control them. It has\nbeen  speculated that they may have made an alliance with one of the remaining local Djinn\nand  allowed  them  almost  full  control  over  the  desert and the desert trade with Rahen.\nProxacha  saw  further  losses  in control as the city-states in the west formed an alliance to\nfree  them  from  their  gnollish overlords. A myriad of small kingdoms and city-states also\nbecame independent and resubjugated as well during these centuries.\n\nOne  of the major appearances of new peoples in Bulwar was after a war between Proxacha\nand the Harpy Queendom around 950 BA. After their hopes of regaining control over Lake\nNaza  were  crushed  by the gnollish forces, the harpies invited another group of nomads in\nfrom the Forbidden Plains. Their movement wasn’t much, but their impact was great. They\ncame  down  from the harpy hills and settled in the lands north and east of Lake Naza, with\ntheir capital placed at Akalšes. In fact it is likely that the Bulwari word Akal as a ruler title\nwas  introduced  by these people, whom scholars have dubbed the Akalites. They became a\nfiercely  independent kingdom that repelled repeated attempts by both gnolls and harpies at\nsubjugating them."

 page_events.1756.d: "\n\nThe  largest  change  within  Bulwar  of the middle of the century is arguably the fall of the\nHarpy Queendom. The exactitudes of this event are not known, but Cannorian texts talk of\na  human  woman  who  killed  the  harpy queen Firanya in a battle in 817 BA. Cannorian\npriests  claim  that  she was the avatar of their Hunter-Goddess Falah, which was a goddess\noriginally  local  to  the  harpy  hills and which later joined the Castanorian Pantheon. But\nthere  is no clear evidence of divine powers, instead it is likely that the story of her heroism\nmade  her  into a local hero and eventually led to her worship as a goddess. Beyond that, it\nis  also  unclear  whether  this  Firanya  she  killed is the same Firanya who proclaimed the\nHarpy Queendom some 350 years prior. There are no records of harpies ever having had a\nlifespan  of  that  time, so this has led to some wild speculation. The three leading theories\nare that either Firanya was some kind of supernatural being, either divine or primordial, or\nthat  that  was  merely  the  name  of  the  queen,  which  coincided  with the name of their\nfounder,  or  the  alternative  is  that  Firanya was the title by which the harpies hailed their\nqueen.  If  the  latter  is  the case then ‘queen Firanya’ is redundant and it would be a battle\nbetween  Falah  and  the  Firanya,  similar  to how we will later see the Xhazobine. Lack of\nwritten sources by the harpies themselves leaves us to rely on later accounts.\n\nRegardless  of  the event itself, its consequences are much better recorded. Tûngric records\nfrom  that  time  report  the complete collapse of the Harpy Queendom following 817 BA.\nThe  Harpy  Hills  were  consequently  divided  among several different Matriarchies, each\ncontrolling  a  much reduced territory. Their structure became much more tribal, revolving\naround  their  individual  roosts  that  all  became  rivals  of  one  another. The subsequent\nconflicts  between  the  Matriarchies  also kickstarted the first of the harpy migration out of\nthe  Harpy  Hills.  Large  flocks  of  harpies  were  seen  heading south, east and west. The\nsouthern   and   western  migrations  disappear  from  the  records,  presumably  they  were\nexterminated  by  the  gnolls  or the castanorians during one of the Cleansings. The eastern\nmigrations are more well recorded as they settled in the mountains on the border of Rahen.\nRecords  from  Verkal  Gulan  and  from the Rahenraj date the appearance of the Siadunan\nharpies to around 805 BA. And like in the west, they would also soon break up into several\nmatriarchies, causing one another as much grief as they did the neighbouring civilisations."

 page_events.1757.d: "\n\n=== The Great Xhaz ===\nWhile  the  title  of  this  chapter  refers  to the Great Xhaz, we will first briefly explore the\nCastanite  Exodus,  since  it  so directly influences the final events of the Age and will have\ngreat  impact  upon  the future of Bulwar and the whole of Halann. However, the Castanite\nExodus  has  been  better  documented in other texts, so only the years relevant to our story\nwill be elaborated on in-depth here.\n\nThese  events  were set in motion by a sacking of Kheterata by a host of gnolls. During this\nsack  a  large  group  of  Kheteratan  slaves  managed  to  escape,  amongst  whom were the\nCastanites.  This group of slaves trekked eastward to Bulwar, which was caught in a period\nof  civil  unrest  and  war, assimilating other groups of former slaves and refugees along the\nway.  In  Bulwar they went through several hardships as they came in conflict with the local\ngnolls.  Especially  the  Zehian  gnolls  did great damage to their numbers after they passed\nthrough  the  mountainous  pass  of  Salahad  Gate.  But as they arrived at the plains of the\nSuran  delta  they  defeated a host of gnolls and humans sent by the kingdom, showing their\naptitude for fighting against great odds, something that would foreshadow conflicts between\ngnolls  and  humans in the future. A number of slaves left Brasan and joined the Castanites\non  their trek northwards. Their numbers swelled even further as they broke the garrison of\nAnzabad  and  freed  even  more  slaves from their chains. With these swelled numbers and\naid  from  the  Tûngric  dwarves  they managed to march through Uak and beyond gnollish\ncontrol.  By  the  end  of  their trek, 23 years later, they reached the Burning Hills, around\nmodern  day  Bal  Ouord, which would be their home for the coming decade and a half. At\nthis  point  their  host  was  made  up  of  Castanites,  kheteratan slaves, Bulwari slaves and\nothers; refugees, criminals, priests, adventurers. Anyone who sought a way out of Bulwar.\n\nSupposedly  it  was that same year, 666 BA, that the Xhazobine was born. Her actual name\nhas  been  lost  to  time and in chronicles she has always been referred to as the Xhazobine,\nbut  this  title  was  one she only took later in life. She was a powerful warrior and possibly\npossessed some innate magical abilities and at an early age she was already able to beat any\ngnoll  in  her  pack.  In 654 BA she came seemingly out of nowhere, possibly she had been\npart  of  one of the wandering tribes from the Salahad, and challenged the Great Matron of\nProxacha  to  single  combat over the rulership of the clan. The stories about the duel itself\nare  probably  exaggerations,  but  she  quite  possibly  wielded  some  powerful  magic and\ndestroyed  the  Great  Matron.  This  incident  has  been  cited as a shift in gnoll culture to\nvalue  strength  over  wisdom  or  age.  Now, ruling over Proxacha, she claimed the title of\nXhazobine   and   renamed   the   kingdom   to  the  Great  Xhaz,  proclaiming  a  demonic\ninheritance and the goal for her and her gnoll brethren to enslave all the world."
 page_events.1758.t: "Bulwari Age of Monsters 8 / 15"
 page_events.1758.d: "\n\nThere  has been much speculation about the relationships between gnolls and demons. The\noldest  records  of gnolls were found in precursor libraries in Aelantir dating back to 27000\nBA. These do suggest a demonic heritage: They describe gnolls coming out of ‘A Mouth of\nFire’  and  capturing  humans  before  disappearing  back  through  this fiery gate with their\ncaptives.  While  this  demonic  connection  could  have been there in precursor times, the\ngnolls  of  the  first  millennium BA did not actually seem to have a demonic nature. It was\nonly  once  the  Xhazobine  proclaimed  the  Great Xhaz and started spreading her demonic\ncult that this connection emerged, and it has remained ever since.\n\nShe  whipped  her  new  pack  into  a  frenzy.  And  fueled  by  a  demonic  fire they swiftly\nsubjugated  the  other  kingdoms  of  Bulwar in a series of brutal wars. The city-states were\neasily  toppled,  with  many  humans  finding  themselves  bound in slavery, and some were\nsacrificed  in  demonic  rituals  to  appease  the  Xhazobine’s  patrons’  lust  for blood. The\nensuing  ‘Decade  of  Flame’  may  have  seen  the death of as much of a third of the human\npopulation of Bulwar. The Xhazobine also fought to unite the other gnolls of Bulwar under\nher  control.  The  fortress capital of the Zehia gnolls was broken open by demonflame and\nthe  fallen kingdom was added to the horde. Uak was the last of the great kingdoms to fall,\nbut  fall it surely did. The Xhazobine steered her horde onwards and westwards from there,\nlooking  to subjugate all the free peoples of Bulwar. It is unclear how long the siege lasted,\nbut  it  must  have  been  an  impressively  siege  for  the  prowess  of a dwarven hold. The\nXhazobine eventually broke the gates of Ovdal Tûngr with her demonflame and the dwarves\nretreated  deep  into  their  hold.  Tûngric records from 652 BA tell how the gnolls ravaged\nthe upper levels, taking all the gold and wealth that they could seize. Now the way west was\nopen  again, and the horde pushed into the last remnants of free Bahar. Azka-szel-Azka fell\nto  gnollish  domination,  along  with the surrounding hills. But the horde didn’t stop there,\nand   in  its  advance  northward  it  would  encounter  the  recently  settled  refugees  from\nKheterata  and  their  Escanni  allies. And the Xhazobine would meet the first defeat of her\ndemonic reign.\n"
 page_events.1759.t: "Bulwari Age of Monsters 9 / 15"
 page_events.1759.d: "\nWhile the majority of her force was tied down repelling an attempt by the Copper Dwarves\nto  retake the upper levels of their hold, the Xhazobine led a smaller force to raid the tribes\nalong  the  Dostanesck  river.  The  refugees from these raids all joined the Kheteratan and\nBulwari  refugees  under  the  banner of the Castanites that had settled the hills of the area.\nThe  Xhazobine  brought defeat after defeat upon them, before they made their last stand in\nthe  Battle  of  Burning  Hill.  There,  aided by a silver dragon, the Castanites defeated the\nXhazobine  and  her forces. She was left with great burn scars from her own demonfire that\nhad been blown back at her host. After that was known by the epitaph, ‘the Flamemarked’.\n\nWhile  the  Xhazobine  retreated to lick her wounds, the Castanites, under Castan I, son of\nHumac,  who  died  in  the  battle,  flee  into  the  Great Forest. Eventually they will found\nCastanor  and  Castan  will  meet  the  Xhazobine  again  in  battle.  In  the  meantime  the\nXhazobine  had  other  matters  to  attend  to. While the rumour of her defeat made its way\nback  into  Bulwar,  many  of its oppressed people saw this as a chance to rise up, aided by\nthe harpy matriarchies who looked to this as their opportunity to deal with the threat of the\ngnolls.  The  Xhazobine  gathered her host again and marched back through Bahar, brutally\nsuppressing  revolts. Finally she also dealt with the harpy clans. She chained the matriarchs\nand sent them to be sold as curiosities to the merchants of Rahen, while the high matriarch\nbecame  her  personal  pet,  to  remind  the  harpies to never challenge her rule again. The\nBulwari  Sun  Cult  remembers  649 BA as the darkest year in history, when the Xhazobine\nslaughtered thousands of men, women and children to fuel her dark rituals.\n\nIn  647  BA  the  Xhazobine  gathered  a  new host, this time to set out westwards along the\nsouthern  coast of the Divenhal. The gnollish campaign in Kheterata was just as devastating\nto  the  land of Elikhet as it was to Bulwar. The kingdom had still not fully recovered from\nits  sacking  18  years  prior,  and  the  Xhazobine’s  host  easily  swept  their  armies aside.\nKheterata  was  sacked  once  more,  and  the  gnolls  pushed southwards, to their ancestral\nhomelands.  Little has been written down about that time, as the gnolls did not take scribes\nwith  them,  but  in  the  few  years the Xhazobine was south of the Salahad she successfully\nspread  the  Xhazobkult  to  the  local gnoll packs and swayed some of their best warriors to\nfollow her horde northwards when she returned to Bulwar."

 page_events.1760.d: "\n\nThe  Xhazobine  had  not  forgotten  about  the  shameful  defeat  she  had  suffered  to the\ncastanites at Burning Hill, she carried the scars from it everywhere she went. And now they\nhad  founded  their  own  kingdom  her  intention seems to have been to wreak her revenge\nupon  this  young  Castanorian  state. She had been reinforced with a great host of southern\ngnolls  and  her  demonic  powers  had been amplified by the many dark and bloody rituals\nshe  had  carried out in Bulwar and Kheterata. The estimates of the size of her horde range\nfrom 30 000 to 100 000 gnolls from different packs and kingdoms all around the Salahad.\n\nThe gnollish host marched through Bahar and up past the Burning Hills. And in those days\nthe  hills  were  literally  burning, as the gnolls burned every sign of settlement on their way\nnorth  from  Bahar,  through  the  plains and riverlands that would become Daravan’s Folly\nsome  1300  years later to stop the advance of another gnollish host. Castan I, who had led\nthe  Castanites  after  the  battle  of  Burning  Hill, had gathered the forces of Castanor and\nmarched  south to the ford of the Dostaneck river, known as Dostan’s Way. This place gave\ndirect  access  to  the  plain  of Castanor beyond. The two forces met there in the month of\nTeysuren in 634 BA.\n\nTales  from  the battle reach us almost exclusively from the sources of Castanorian scholars\nand  Castanite  propaganda,  so it is difficult to construct the gnollish side of the story. The\nCastanorians’ claim about the summoning of demons by the Xhazobine and her followers is\nmost certainly true and was but one manifestation of the power the Xhazobine had gathered\nthrough  her  plentiful  and  bloody sacrifice. The Castanite forces were on the defense and\nheld the ford, while the gnolls crossed in their thousands, only to perish when they reached\nthe  Castanorian  defensive  line.  Modern  scholars  still  debate  the  array  of other spells\navailable  to the Xhazobine, and she did use many during this battle. However the accounts\nare   too   confused  to  give  any  clear  description.  But  clearly  the  Xhazobine  engaged\npersonally  into  the  combat  at  the  head  of  a group of demons. They broke through the\nCastanorian  line  and  started  tearing  them  apart.  The  formations  of  the Castanorians\nshattered  and it seemed to turn into a rout, until Ormac, Castan’s cousin, killed one of the\ngreat beasts and inspired the men to hold fast."

 page_events.1761.d: "\n\nWhile  the  battle raged and more gnolls poured across the river, Castan and the Xhazobine\nsought  each  other  out.  Both  were  fueled  by  hate and yearned for revenge. One for his\nfather,  and the Xhazobine for her burning and defeat 17 years earlier. She had learned that\nCastan  was  the one to summon the silver dragon that had meant her defeat and she would\nbe  sure  to  torture  him  as  her wounds had tortured her. Castan’s plight seemed hopeless\nunder  the  demonic  fury  of  the  Xhazobine  and  many of his companions fell to her foul\nmagic.  But  when  all seemed dire he managed to plunge a holy spear into her side and the\nXhazobine  fell.  Not  dead,  but  incapacitated,  she  fled.  And  the  resolve  of  her horde\nshattered with her flight. Many more gnolls died in the river during the retreat.\n\n=== The First Great Cleansing ===\nBulwari  records  tell of the destruction that the Xhazobine had wrought during the Decade\nof  Flame  after  her  first  defeat at Burning Hill. It can therefore be understood that when\nnews  of the defeat at Dostan’s Way reached the oldest cities of humanity, there was no great\nrevolt  and  no  great celebration. The priests of the Sun Cult whispered of hope, but many\nof  the  cities  were  fearful  of what was to come. What was to come was much different to\nwhat they expected, however.\n\nThe  Xhazobine’s  host  had  slowly  regrouped  after the disaster at Dostan’s Way. But their\nleader  was  still  gravely  wounded  and her powers a shadow of their previous strength. So\ntheir  retreat  was  aimed  at returning to their heartland in Bulwar to regain their strength.\nBut  Castan  was  not  satisfied with a simple defeat. He wished to see this threat dealt with\nonce  and  for  all.  His  forces  pursued  the  Xhazobine’s  relentlessly,  and so to buy their\npackmates  and  leader  more  time  a large force of gnolls stayed behind at Burning Hill to\nhold  off  their  enemies.  While  this  did  not defeat Castan, it did allow the Xhazobine to\nescape  through  Bahar.  While  Castan  spent  time  reinforcing  his  southern  border and\nhunting  down  and  exterminating  gnoll  backs  still  within his newly conquered land, the\nXhazobine went to Bulwar and started gathering new forces.\n"

 page_events.1762.d: "\nThe  human population of Bulwar was too afraid to rise up against their demonic overlord,\nbut  that  was  not  the  case  for  her  gnollish  subjects.  The  Kingdom  of  Uak in Bahar\nproclaimed  its  independence  once  more, while many gnolls south of the Salahad left her\nservice  to  seek their own demonic strength. With the independence of the Uaki kingdom,\nthe  humans  of  western  Bahar  claimed  their freedom under the protection of a resurgent\nOvdal Tûngr. This short-lived kingdom of Akal-Szel-Akal became the first Bulwari subject\nof  Castanor  just  7  years  after the battle of Dostan’s Way, as the Castanorians seemed the\nmost  likely  to  be  able  to  protect  them  against  new gnollish incursions. And while the\nCopper Dwarves did not submit to Castan, they did offer military and financial support for\na  campaign  into  Bulwar proper, which started in 624 BA, with the devastating Liberation\nof Aqatbahar against the newly independent Kingdom of Uak.\n\nCastan’s  army halted here to set up a base of operations and to integrate the region into the\nCastanorian  administration. The presence of this new foreign power in Bulwar itself seems\nto  have  brought  a  great  deal  of  unrest to the region. And the Xhazobine had to spend a\ngreat  deal  of  effort  keeping  the  region  under control. Eventually the Castanorian army\nwould  march  out  again  to  invade  the  lands  of  Bulwar  proper,  but  the armies of the\nXhazobine  were  waiting for him. In a narrow pass in Eonkavan, she had set up an ambush\nthat  was  sprung  in  Tearfal  of 618 BA. When Castan marched his forces into the pass to\nfight   what   he   thought   was   a   smaller   force,  he  found  himself  outnumbered  and\noutmaneuvered.  But  again  a  miracle  saved  the  Castanorians.  While  the  forces of the\nXhazobine  descended  upon  their line from all sides, the silver dragon appeared. This was\nthe  same  one  that  saved  the  Castanites  at  Burning  Hill and is associated with the god\nCastellos  in Castanorian myth. It burned the Xhazobine and her host and reduced them to\nashes.  After  this  Battle  of  the  White Flame, nothing was left of the Great Xhaz and the\ngnollish  unity  in  Bulwar  was  shattered  once and for all. Castan I was not seen after the\nbattle  either.  Some  speculate  that  he sacrificed himself to summon the dragon. Without\ntheir  leader,  the  Castanorian armies turned around and marched back to Aqatbar and Bal\nOuord, where they had been stationed, as they waited to be called into action once more.\n"

 page_events.1763.d: "\nWithout  the  Xhazobine the exhausted nations of Bulwar were left fighting over the scraps.\nProxacha was reestablished, but it had to contend with a newly founded human kingdom in\nHašr  that  aggressively  sought  to  usurp the trade with Rahen. In the west the city state of\nMedurubar  established  a  domain  around  the  lower  reaches  of  the Suran, retaining its\nindependence  from  the  gnolls  that still lived in the Šad Sur. During this time the Cult of\nSurakel  became  the  official  faith of many of these human kingdoms as a reaction against\nthe still predominantly Xhazobkult gnollish kingdoms.\n\n=== The Second Great Cleansing ===\nMore  has been written about the Second Great Cleansing elsewhere, as the majority of the\nviolence  that  Castan  II  ‘Beastbane’  wrought  against  the less civilised races of the world\noccurred  in  Escann  and  so  falls  out  of the scope of our story. It is worth noting that he\nhunted down the last gnolls in Cannor before his campaign into Bulwar and Sarhal.\n\nIn  Bulwar  the  tension  between  the  gnolls  and human states was at a high ever since the\natrocities during the Decade of Flame, but the devastated region was not in all-out war due\nto  the exhaustion of both groups. Instead it was a mess of alliances between city-states and\npetty  kingdoms  that  broke  out  into  occasional  short  wars  over minor disputes. By no\nmeans  did  all  human  kingdoms  oppose  gnollish rule. Many remembered the prosperity\nthey  lived in before the Xhazobine. The state of Anzabad still actively traded in slaves with\nthe  gnollish-occupied  kingdom  of  Kheterata  and  the  city  state  of  Duklum Tanuz had\nenjoyed protection from their gnollish overlords against harpy raids.\n\nSo  when  Castan  II  marshalled his troops in Aqatbar and marched into Bulwar, he found\nmany  allies  among  the  human  kings, but also many enemies. His campaigns against the\nharpies  of  the  harpy  hills  were of little importance to the greater conflict within Bulwar,\nbut as he made his way south the great division within the region became clear. His greatest\nallies  became  Grand  Maraš  Kikud  of  Brasan,  King  Nahroon  of Medurubar and King\nArashq  of  Akalšes.  Brasan’s  fleets  aided  the  Castanorian  and Tûngric admirals as they\nengaged  the  Drolas,  Anzabad  and  Kheteratan fleets throughout the Divenhal. The other\ntwo kingdoms supported the Castanorians on land."

The  three  armies  then  met up there to siege the great gnollish\ncapital. Meanwhile the fleets of the Drolas Kingdom and Anzabad clashed with the Tûngric\nand  Castanorian fleets at Drolas’ Tip and defeated them soundly through expert knowledge\nof  the  rocky  shallows.  On  land  the  armies  of Brasan and Medurubar joined up with a\nsecondary  Castanorian  force and set about clearing the lower Suran plain from any gnolls.\nSeeing  their  strength,  many  of  the  city  states of western Bulwar joined their cause. But\nDuklum  Tanuz  and  several  other Bulwari city states allied with the gnollish kingdoms of\nmiddle  and  south  Bulwar  to stand as a united front against the foreign invaders. To them\nthe  gnolls  were  as  much  a  part  of  Bulwar  as the priests of the sun cult, and it was the\nCastanorians who were the hostile and alien threat.\n\nIt  was  in  the  late  autumn  of  571  BA  when  the fortified palace of Proxacha Eklu fell.\nCastan  had  all  the  gnolls he found inside slaughtered and sent their pelts off to be turned\ninto  leather.  The  Bulwari  took  to  this with a fervor, as these men had not forgotten the\nhorror  the  Xhazobkult  had  wrought  upon  their  people  and all the blood that had been\nspilled. After the sacking of Proxacha Eklu, the armies in the east marched down the Suran\nto  aid  King  Nahroon  who  led the armies of the western city states against the gnolls and\ntheir allies in central Bulwar.\n\nThe  two armies met at Ginerdu in Esmarment of 570 BA, on a plain between the banks of\nthe  Baranun  and the ruins of an old genie palace long left without name. The Castanorian\nside  was  made  up of some 30 000 Castanorian soldiers, augmented with 12 000 Akalšesi\nhorsemen,  8000  Medurubari  soldiers,  5000  Brasanni soldiers, and 10000 soldiers from\nvarious  other  city  states, such as Bulwar, Hašr, Kalib and Suran Narit. On the other side\nwere  40  000  gnolls from various kingdoms of the Šad Sur, the Bulwari plain and Drolas,\nalong  with 6000 soldiers from Duklum Tanuz and another 6000 from Anzabad, with some\n7000 soldiers from other allied city states, such as Kaboustraz, Azanerdu and Surib. Under\nthe  leadership  of  Castan  II  the  Bulwari-Castanorian  alliance  clashed with the gnollish\nalliance.  The  gnolls,  who were being led by a packlord named Lyhz Breaker-of-Enemies,\nheld  their  ground  and  showed  clearly  the ferocity that had allowed them to become the\nlords  of  Bulwar  four  centuries earlier. But things had changed in those centuries and the\nonce  divided nations had now formed a unified front alongside the Castanorians, while the\ngnolls  were  no  more united. The Breaker-of-Enemies’ control over the various packs was\nonly  fleeting  and  when  Castan  feigned  a  retreat,  her  orders to hold their ground were\nthrown  aside  and  gaps  in  the  gnollish lines appeared quickly. As Castan halted his line,\nArashq  led  his  12  000  horse  out  of the ruins into the disorganised flank of the gnollish\nline.  Man  and  gnoll  alike  fell  under spear and hoof and as the Castanorian line bent to\nsupport  their  Akalšesi  allies  they  began  pushing  their  enemies  into  the  river. While\ngnollish  alliance  collapsed, Castan gave the order to kill every last one of them, regardless\nof  whether  they  were  gnoll  or  human,  as  they  would  not  tolerate any treason against\nmankind."

 page_events.1765.d: "\n\nAfter the Battle of Ginerdu the remaining gnolls were chased from Bulwar and into the Šad\nSur,  where  the  Castanorians  pursued them. But due to superior knowledge of the terrain\nmany  were  able  to  escape and flee into the Salahad. Meanwhile Castan’s attention turned\nwestwards, to the Kingdom of Kheterata that was still under gnollish control. The kingdom\nhad  started  to meddle in the eastern Divenhal and was supporting the Drolas and Anzabad\nfleets  as  they  used  the  sea  to dominate and resupply their besieged cities. The Brasanni\nfleet was now ready and had joined up with their northern allies, but it was difficult to deal\nwith  the expert sailors of the pirate kingdoms. So, accompanied and supplied by his fleets,\nCastan  marched  west  upon  the  kingdom  of  Kheterata,  which  he  freed  from gnollish\ndominion and made a Castanorian ally. Next he marched further south, where according to\nlegend  he  fought the remaining gnolls and closed the ‘gates of hell’ from which they came.\nBut  he  never  returned,  and there were still many gnolls left after his heroic or misguided\nmarch  south.  It  is  unclear  what really became of him or his army, perhaps they were all\nslaughtered  and  eaten  by  the  local  gnolls,  which  is what their stories say. But they rely\npurely  on  oral tradition and it has been a millennium since those events before the stories\nwere recorded.\n\nIn  Bulwar,  Anzabad  eventually  fell and it became a Castanorian possession, along with a\nlarge  part  of  the  coast of the Gulf of Glass and the Bay of Mirrors. Castan’s commanders\nhanded  the  control  over  the  Bulwari  city  states  to  their allies in the region and would\noversee  the peace there. And so, despite his disappearance and presumed death in 569 BA,\nCastan  II  ‘Beastbane’  ended  the  Age  of Monsters in Bulwar and started the Castanorian\nAge.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

 page_events.190.d: "\nBulwari  Pantheon  refers  to  the  original  religious  beliefs  and  practices  of the Bulwari\npeoples  between  circa  2800  BA  and 1000 BA, prior to the establishment of the Bulwari\nSun  Cult  as the main religion of the subcontinent. Originally, the Bulwari Pantheon was a\npolytheistic  religion  with  the  gods  structured in a familiar hierarchy, with each city-state\nhaving  a  national  god  as the head of the pantheon. The religion later evolved to have the\nSun god as the head of the pantheon.\n\n== History ==\nThe  Bulwari  pantheon evolved over time, and is often divided into three separate periods:\nThe God-king or Ancient Bulwari period, the Karqašlu period and the Sun Cult period.\n\nThe  sources  of  the  ancient  period  are  very  fragmented,  and historians only manage to\nreconstruct  some  ritual  practices and relations between the different gods. Some scholars\ntheorize  that the gods of the Ancient Bulwari Pantheon were in fact the original God-kings\nof  each  city,  turned  into  deities  after  their death, but this theory is considered by other\nscholars as lacking evidence other than circumstantial one.\n\nThe Karqašlu Pantheon presents some differences over the previous period. We see the rise\nof  the  Sun  god  as head of the pantheon, popularized thanks to the conquest of Bulwar by\nthe  Karqašlu  Empire.  While there is evidence of the Sun being worshiped during the Age\nof  God-kings,  Sarqa,  the  Karqašlu  sun god is considered more similar in representation\nand portfolio to Tapashur, the proto-Zabatlari sun god, than to Sar, the Bulwari sun god of\nthe previous period.\n\nIn  the  Sun  Cult  period  we  see  a  great  evolution  of  the  pantheon.  Sarqa, the sun of\nKarqašlu,  merged  with  two  other gods: Kirašqqu, the son of Kuza and god of agriculture\nand  civilization  and  Qayiakal,  the  patron  Sun  god  of  the proto-Zablatari Akalites and\ncreator  of  humankind,  into a new god, Surakel. The new Sun god replaced Sarqa as head\nof  the  pantheon,  and due to interactions with new races, like dwarves, gnolls and harpies,\nother gods of the pantheon were credited with their creation."
 page_events.1766.t: "Bulwari Pantheon 2 / 7"
 page_events.1766.d: "\n\nScholars  agree  that  the  concept  of  a  warrior  Sun god was introduced in Bulwar by the\nnomadic   Akalites  that  migrated  from  the  Serpent’s  Gift.  According  to  archeological\nevidence,  the  concept of a Malevolent Dark or a god of Darkness was unknown in Bulwar\nuntil the Onslaught.\n\nIn  this  period  we  see  the beginnings of the Sun Cult, which claimed that the gods of the\npantheon  were  either  dead  or  corrupted, and that Surakel sacrificed his physical body to\nbecome  the  Sun. Once the cult replaced the pantheon as the main religion of the Bulwari,\nthe  pantheon  evolved  into  its  current  form  that  fits  into  the  Sun Cult cosmogony. Is\ntheorized  that  one of the reasons for the Cult's popularity was that it elevated Surakel, the\ngod  of  Mankind,  over  the  other  gods,  specially those who made the different races that\ninvaded Bulwar.\n\n== Cosmogony and mythology ==\nThe  Bulwari  believed in the existence of an innumerable number of gods, both major and\nminor.  Major  gods  included phenomena like the sky or the wind, while minor gods were\nassociated with certain objects or features, like river gods or gods of certain roads or crafts.\nIn  the  case  of  minor  gods,  we  have  evidence  of  gods with overlapping portfolios, for\nexample,  Gillu,  a  minor  god of scribes from the middle Suran plain, and Ata, a different\ngod from Bahar associated with scribes and genealogy.\n\n=== Creation Myth ===\nAt  the  beginning  there  were  only two primordials, Šadru, the mountains, and Abiya, the\nsea.  Of  their meeting and mingling, the world came into existence. The first generation of\nmajor  gods  started  with  Kuza,  the Moon, and her light illuminated the world before the\nSun  came to be. After Kuza, the gods and goddess of Earth, Sky and Freshwater were born\nfrom the two primordials.\n\nThe  second  generation of major gods consisted of Nilšranu, goddess of the wind, Amaštu,\ngoddess of nature, and Surakel, god of gardening and civilization."

 page_events.1767.d: "\n\nThe  god of Freshwater was the progenitor of the river gods and goddesses and Amaštu gave\nbirth to plants and animals, and their respective gods.\n\n=== The Domains of the Gods ===\nThe  major gods had areas where their influence and power was stronger, but we only know\na few of them. The Salahad was the domain of Amaštu, goddess of nature, and was a fertile\nplain  with  many  forests  in it. The Serpentspine mountains was the domain of Šadru, and\nthe Divenhal was the domain of Abiya. Modern Bulwar was the domain of Surakel.\n\n=== The Garden of Surakel ===\nSurakel  was the only child to Kuza, and he took residence in the land of Surakeš, where he\nmade  his  Garden.  Surakel  married  the  goddesses  Suran  and  Buranun,  and  the three\ntogether  created  mankind  to  help  Surakel  complete his vision, a beautiful garden in the\ncenter of the creation.\n\n=== The Creation of the Dwarves ===\nThe dwarves were created by Šadru after learning of the existence of mankind. When Šadru\nsaw  Surakel’s  creation,  he  said  to himself “If my grandson is capable of such a creation,\nwhat  will  I,  the  fatherless one, be capable of creating? No doubt I can create a people so\nmagnificent that it would put the humans of Surakel on the same level as Amaštu’s beasts.”\n\nThen  Šadru  collected  the strongest and purest metals from the mountains, and with them\nhe  made  beings  five  times  taller  than  men,  but  when  he put his divine flame in their\nbodies, they fell apart.\n\nEight  more  times  Šadru attempted, and eight more times his creations fell apart. The old\nprimordial  developed a grudge against his grandson, blaming Surakel for his failure. Then,\nŠadru  made  one  last  attempt,  this  time, he made his children smaller than humans, but\nstockier and stronger."

The oldest surviving\nversion  of  the  myth says that Nilšranu felt jealous of Surakel’s wives, so she used magic to\ntrick Surakel to lie with her.\n\nWhen  Surakel  became  free  of  the  spell, he pursued Nilšranu, who fled north, to a lake\nbetween the mountains. Fearing for his life and his future child, she pleaded with his father\nŠadru for protection from Surakel.\n\nThe  primordial,  still  holding  a  grudge  against  his  grandson,  raised  the lands between\nSurakel’s Garden and the lake, creating the Šad Našratu, the Harpy Hills. There, safe from\nSurakel, Nilšranu gave birth to Firanya, the first of the harpies.\n\n=== The Friendship of Bulwari and Dwarves ===\nSurakel,  wanting  to avoid conflict with his grandfather and his children, invited Šadru and\nthe dwarves to a feast in the lands where the city of Bulwar now stands. Food and wine was\nexchanged,  and  words  of  friendship  were  made. At the end of the feast, Surakel gifted a\nplant to the Dwarves, which he told them it can be used to make an alcoholic beverage.\n\nThe  dwarves  took  the  gift  back  to  the  mountains  and  the  plant  spread  through  the\nDwarovar  in  a  year.  It's  unknown  where it happened, but the dwarves used the plant to\ncreate a new alcoholic beverage, beer.\n\nGrateful for such a gift, the Dwarves swore eternal friendship to Surakel and the peoples of\nBulwar."

The  texts  suggest  that there once were many gods amongst their pantheon, but\nmany  of  them  fell  in  this war. Most of their names have not survived the ages, but some\nare  mentioned  as cursed. These gods carried the names Raša, Jiqaat and Ukedu. They fell\nto the Darkness and became its slaves. These days they are known as the demons of hunger,\nsickness and wrath, and parents and priests use them to scare children and the pious. Other\ngods  fought  the  many  named  and unnamed evils of the Darkness. One by one they were\nslain, until a lone god, Surakel, remained. To protect the world from the Darkness he gave\nup  his  mortal  coil.  His  bright soul ascended to the heavens and became the radiant sun.\nHe  continues  the  struggle  far  up  in the sky, where he holds out against the forces of the\nDarkness  until  he  can  again regain his mortal form to destroy the Darkness once and for\nall.\n\n===The Nature of Dark and Light===\nThe  vagueness of our sources make it unclear what exactly the Darkness, sometimes called\nthe  “Malevolent  Dark”,  is. It is undoubtedly equated to the evils of this world. Evils that\nare  both  internal and external. External evils, such as hunger and sickness, are beyond the\ncontrol of us mortals, and as such a failed harvest or a plague are victories of the Darkness.\nSome  priests  have  claimed  that these events are a consequence of the darkness within the\nfaithful  and  a lack of commitment to Surakel’s struggle, while certain theologians, such as\nSerim of Anzabad, have theorised that such an event indicates the general state of the world\nand  a  temporary lapse in Surakel’s fight. Internal evils are diseases of the heart and mind.\nAnger,  jealousy and selfishness are some of the most prominent demons that the Sun Cults\nwarn against."

And so the faithful are expected to spread these feelings.\nGenerosity,  friendship  and  inclusivity  important to the people of Bulwar. Small festivals\nand  parties  to  include  the  community  and  keep  the  atmosphere positive are regularly\norganized. Most importantly: Stay positive, true.\n\nThe  racial attitude of the Sun Cult is closely aligned to the way certain groups have treated\nthe  temples  and  the  people  of  Bulwar.  Gnolls, above all else, are seen as the agents of\nDarkness  by  both  the  Old  and  the  New  Sun  Cult. Their centuries long occupation of\nBulwar  and  their  brutalization  have  clearly  delineated  their  place in the Struggle: The\nvanguard  of  the  Malevolent Dark. Harpies have long been a nuisance, and while they are\nseen  as  a  force  of the Malevolent Dark, this appears to mainly be a consequence of their\nfaithlessness. With both positive and negative interactions occurring between the two races,\nthe  temples of different areas in Bulwar disagree on their role within the Struggle and their\nchance of redemption.\n\n==Universal tenets of the Bulwari religions==\n# Serve only Surakel, all other gods are dead\n# Banish the darkness from your heart\n# Keep the light of your children\n# Speak no lies, dark and false\n# Don’t abandon hope, the sun will come again\n# Let shine the light of joy\n\n1.

He  continued  his  fight  against  the  darkness, striking out west against the\nSorcerer-King  of Black Castanor and venturing east to bring the Light to Haless, where he\nwas  assassinated.

Even  if  a  Buycev  were  to  adopt the Ynnic ways and civilize, he would\nremain a Corrupted because of his appearance, and Ynnic Ruinborn may refuse to associate\nwith him.\n\nWhen  people from a Buycev group lived within the borders of the Ynnic Empire they were\noften  treated  as  second-class  citizens,  as was the case for the Rzentur, who were initially\nconfined to ghettos and designated villages away from the towns of proper Ynnics.\n\nCannorian  people,  while  also  seen  with  distrust  at  times,  are  considered  to be more\ncivilized  than  Buycev.

Allegedly, when the Adbrabohvi river-priests codified the Myth of the Ending Flood\nat  the  Council  of  Velikvab,  their  intention  was  for  all  living beings who survived the\nEnding  Flood  to  figure  among  those  chosen,  and this included the Buycev. This didn't\nprevent  many  Ynnics  from  discriminating  the  Buycev, claiming they had fallen onto the\nstray  path  of  barbarism,  while  others  went  as  far  as to claim that the Buycev were the\nstraddling  remnants of the evil world which the Ynn failed to cleanse completely, ascribing\ntheir mutated appearance to not just physical but also moral and spiritual corruption.\n\n==The Celadil Controversy==\nIn  1470  AA,  Lord  Carodin  II  of  Arverynn  had  started  the  reconquest  of his alleged\nbirthright,  the  Ynnic  Empire.  To  gain  an  edge against the feudal lords he was trying to\nsubjugate,  he  had  formed  the  Veykodan  Guard,  a  unit of Veykodan rune warriors and\nsabertooth riders who secured him many resounding victories."

The ensuing arguments had the unforeseen consequence of\nsparking  a  theological  debate  over the origin of the Corrupted Ruinborn, where Carodin\nwas forced to choose a side. He had two options:\n*Declaring  only  the  Ynnics  were  chosen, and thus the Veykodans were an evil people he\nhad been earnestly trying to set on the path of righteousness.\n*Declaring  that  all  Buycev,  including  Veykodans,  were  fellow  brothers  of  the  Ynnic\nRuinborn who had only fallen to barbarism temporarily.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Unfortunately, many in\nCannor  believed  the  Korbarid  narrative and saw the Cardesti as cursed and even blamed\nthem for the Folly itself.\n\n===Itinerant People===\nWith  this  the  Cardesti  became  a  reviled  group  of  travellers  that would be persecuted\nthroughout   history,   though  one  treated  with  caution  when  it  came  to  their  gifts  in\ndivination.\n\n===Rule of the Augur Queen===\nIn 810 a large clan of Cardesti joined other Castanorian settlers in the Forlorn Vale, which\nhad  long  been  a  land  best  left  alone  due  to  its  dark past. Over time more and more\nCardesti  travellers  arrived  from  all  over  Cannor,  turning  their  wagons into makeshift\nvillages  across  the  vale. Like their travelling bands, the Cardesti settlements were unified\nunder  a  powerful  seer,  which  in  this case came a young girl of sixteen named Dunicha.\nDunicha   was  already  known  as  a  powerful  diviner  and  had  frequently  attended  the\nCastanorian  court  from  the  age  of  six  to  speak  prophecy to the then emperor, Castan\nFrostbane.\n\nBy  820  Dunicha  had  used  her  powers  to peacefully unite the Cardesti and Castanorian\nsettlers  in  the  Forlorn  Vale  and  proclaimed  the state of Great Cardest, which was even\napproved by Castan Frostbane himself. By then, Dunicha would no longer have to travel to\nCastonath  to  read  fortunes  for  the  emperor, instead, the emperor and many other great\nmen  of  the  time  would visit Dunicha's court at the Cardesti city of Vardoced (located in\nmodern-day  Ibevar  City).  She  would  become  known  as  the  Augur Queen, despite her\ndenying any sort of royal title.\n\nGreat  Cardest  continued to grow and by 840 it grew both in land and sphere of influence,\nde  facto  ruling  over much of The Borders. During this year conflict with their Corvurian\nneighbours  in the Dostanor Dominion finally sparked open war, and for once Cardest had\nto fight."

 page_events.1796.d: "\n\n===Wars of the Augur Queen and Independence===\nLed  by  Dostanor,  many  kingdoms  rallied  against Great Cardest, such as the Wexonard\nKingdom  and  Adenica.  By  850  the  war was officially over, and Great Cardest officially\nconquered  Dostanor,  writing  the  wrongs of Daravan's Folly 200 years before. With this,\nCastan Frostbane officially gave Dunicha the title of Governor of the Dostanor Dominion.\nIt is said during this time the Cardesti prosecuted the native Corvurians and banished many\nof them from their lands.\n\nHowever, in 864 the Sack of Vertesk occured and Dunicha fell out of favour with Castanor\nafter failing to predict the event for the emperor, and she was officially humiliated at court.\nCastanor  officially revoked her title of Governor which essentially sanctioned revolt in her\nlands,  in return, Dunicha publically cursed Castan XLVIII to "bring death to the empire".\nThis   marked   the  beginning  of  the  Second  War  of  the  Augur  Queen,  which  ended\ninconclusively  with  the  death  of  the  emperor  by an invading reaver who would later be\nknown  Castan  Ebonfrost.  Cardest  officially proclaimed independence, and it is said that\nDunicha's curse brought an end to Castanor proper.\n\n===Fall of Great Cardest===\nDunicha  attended the coronation of Castan Ebonfrost and even offered an alliance with the\nfledgling  king,  having  foreseen  the  imminent  rebellion of his new vassals. Despite this,\nCastan  Ebonfrost  abhorred  sorcery,  and  instead  blinded  Dunicha  and personally led a\npogrom of the Cardesti in Castonath.\n\nUpon  her return to Vardoced, the Augur Queen began rallying for war, and now conspired\nwith  many  other  rebellious  lords  and  governors  hoping  to  do the same. The Cardesti\npeople,  on the other hand, were tired of wars and politics that Dunicha had led her people\ninto  -  with  many  prestigious  Cardesti  clans  leaving  for a nomadic life elsewhere. This\nmarked  the  beginning  of  a period of unrest in Great Cardest, with many Cardesti vassals\njoining  revolts and plots against her, along with her subjects in The Borders and Corvuria,\nand by 868 Cardest was pushed back to their de jure lands in the Forlorn Vale."

 page_events.1797.d: "\n\nIn  871  the  Cardesti  army  rebelled  and  let  through  a  legion sent by Castan Ebonfrost\nhimself.  Fearing  the  loss  of  her  kingdom  and a place for her people Dunicha she put a\ngreat curse on her land, its invaders, and her people.\n\n==The Augur Queen's Curse==\n''"You and your blood will forever be trapped in mine lands, and no Man from the Beyond\nwill  ever  call  mine  lands  home.  And to mine blood Beyond, an eternal and malevolent\ncurse. You were offered a place to grow your roots yet you have fled back to the wilds. And\nflee  you  shall, for any of mine blood that dares to grow roots shall wither and die within a\nfortnight."''\n\nWith  this,  the  reputation  of  the Forlorn Vale as a cursed place amplified. Records say a\ngreat  mist  rose  across the land, and those outside of the forests proper were forced to flee\nor  be  choked  by  the deadly fogs. But the mystery came from those within the forest, and\nwithin Vardoced: for none ever made it out.\n\nThe  Cardesti people can confirm the effects of the curse, and now cannot stay more in one\nplace  for  longer  than two weeks, or they get afflicted in what is known as The Withering,\ncausing them to decay from within.\n\nThe  Forlorn  Vale  would  be  a  place  avoided by most, with only a few settlements at its\nedges,  though some say that one should never trust maps of the vale, for settlements clearly\nmarked could disappear the next and take unsuspecting travellers with it.\n\nIt  would  be  only  after  the  War  of  the  Sorcerer  King that the Forlorn Vale would see\nactivity,  and  it  was  one of the many places where skirmishes occured. By this time Black\nCastanor  had been aggressively colonizing the region despite its reputation, and had used it\nas  a  staging  point  for  several  of  its  invasions  into  the East Dameshead, along with its\nCorvurian  territories.  The  Free  Realms used the land as a way to get behind Castanorian\nlines  with  ease,  and  by the end of the war many makeshift camps had been established in\nthe region."

Although his family had once been one of the more prominent houses\nin  the  empire,  and  had  been infamous for Venac the Arrogant, one of the acolytes of the\nSorcerer  King,  their  possessions  had  long  been  lost,  relegating him to minor nobility.\nAlthough  his  martial  skill  was  evident  even  early  in  his life, due to his station he was\nunable to truly apply himself until the coming of the Greentide.\n===The Coming of the Greentide===\nAs  the  Orcs  poured  out  of  the  mountains,  he  was  able  to rise to a certain amount of\nprominence after leading several successful engagements against the orcs, such as the Battle\nof  the  Silver Bridge where he was able to surround and slaughter a large Orc raiding party\nin  northern Castellyr, though none so great that he could prevent the fall of Castellyr. He,\nalong  with  many  other nobles, retreated with what people and forces they could gather to\nthe  fortress  of  Oldhaven,  forming  the  Count's  League.  Whilst  Carleon  was not even\nconsidered  for  leadership  due  to his low rank in the noble hierarchy, he was hopeful that\nthe  League  would  strike  out  against the Orcs and retake their homeland. Ultimately the\nLeague fell into infighting and decided to cower behind Oldhavens walls.\n===The Long War===\nDisgusted,  Carleon gathered what forces would follow him and began campaigning against\nthe  orcs,  winning  several victories over the years, though never dealing the crushing blow\nhe  needed.  Attrition  whittled down his army, forcing him to use more Guerrilla tactics as\nthe  years  wore on. The rest of League mistrusted his ambition and disliked his low status,\nsome  calling  for  his  execution  as  they  believed his actions would bring the horde down\nupon  their  hideout, making him a maverick and an outcast. During his long and gruelling\ncampaign,  news  continued to filter back to Oldhaven of his daring exploits, and more and\nmore  of  the  younger  nobles began to idolise him as a hero of the Empire whilst his peers\ngrew more and more distrustful. This state of affairs continued until Carleon, on one of his\nmany raids into orc territory, encountered a woman by the name of Corin.\n===Meeting Corin and Rise to Power==="

The\nother   nobles   saw   this  as  another  threat  to  their  position  and  used  Corin  and  her\ncompanions  as an excuse to remove Carleon, claiming that Lothane Bluetusk was a spy for\nthe  horde. Carleon stood to defend the half orc, just as the League's leaders expected, then\nthey tried to have them all executed in a trial by combat. It was at this point that the young\nand  military  nobility  of  the  League,  who were sick of spending their entire lives behind\nwalls  whilst their home suffered, openly revolted against the League's leaders.

 page_events.216.d: "\nThe  Caseán  was  a  type of fortified structure unique to the Kingdom of Farraneán, which\nwere  initially  built  for the sake of protecting the realm from the White Pestilence. Later,\nthey  served the same function in halting the arrows of Ibevari archers, as well as defending\ntheir  populations  from  the  onset of The Greentide. These structures were fortified towns\nand  cities  served  as a hub of defence for nearby villages. These villages aided the Caseáns\nin  creating  and  maintaining  the  reserves  of  supplies  they would employ in sieges. The\nCaseán   were   primarily   built   near   important  trade  routes  or  roads  towards  major\nsettlements,  with  some  of  the  Kingdom's  more  important cities having several in close\nproximity.\n\n== Layout ==\nThe  Caseán employed a flower-like arrangement, a tactic refined and more widely adopted\nin  the  later  Star  Forts  that  became  the  standard  in  the  centuries after the Kingdom's\ndestruction.\n\n=== Walls ===\nTheir  structures  were  designed  with  elven  styled  domes.  The roof above the walls and\ntowers  were in a similar style, often constructed from hardy Cursewood lumber, to protect\nfrom arrows and other projectiles. The walls had menacing protrusions of varying nature to\nprevent scaling, along with murder holes, through which arrows and spears could be thrust.\nThey  were  often  constructed  primary outer wall, with another inside, and a central keep,\nallowing  for  multiple  layers  for the defenders to take positions in. These were sometimes\ndivided  by  retractable  drawbridges.  In these instances, there was ditch and moat between\neach  wall,  and another for the keep in the middle, leaving the keep essentially an "island"\nin the middle of the fortress.\n\n== Structures ==\nAt  the  centre  of  the  Caseán the keep served to house refugees from nearby villages. The\ninner  sections  had  small  gardens  and  storehouses  for supplies. While the gardens only\napproached  sustenance  level  in their production in peacetime, they did provide enough to\nextend  sieges by a notable margin, supplementing established peacetime reserves and those\nsupplies  that  refugees from outside the walls would provide. The keep would often extend\nunderground in larger examples, to shelter more inhabitants. As a last ditch measure, many\nhad  tunnels to evacuate outside and escape to well-concealed entrances that often appeared\nas  natural mounds or caves. The middle of the Keep held a circular table around a tree, in\nthe  pattern  of  the  Scogtrín,  which served as a base for the commanders of the fortress to\ndiscuss and plan during a siege and acted as a grand dining area for visitors during peace."

 page_events.224.d: "\nThe Castanite Exodus (689 BA - 639 BA) is the founding myth detailing the journey of the\nCastanite peoples and founding of the Empire of Castanor under Castan the Progenitor.\n\n==Summary==\nThe  Exodus is said to have begun shortly after the Great Sack of Kheterat which led to the\nmassive  destabilization  of  Kheterata  and  the  North  Salahad region in general, allowing\nmany  slaves  to  flee  eastwards towards Bulwar. Upon reaching Bulwar the region too was\nfacing heavy attacks from a combination of civil war between rival city-states in addition to\nincursions  of  rival  gnollish  kingdoms  and  slavers.  As the former slaves continued their\njourney  northwards they were joined a by more and more peoples seeking a new life in the\nnorth, and by the time they settled in the modern-day Burning Hills they were an extremely\ndiverse group of human peoples.\n\nIn  651  BA  a young Castan the Progenitor invoked victory by summoning a silver dragon,\nthe  Avatar  of  Castellos,  during  the Battle of Burning Hill against the Gnoll Great Xhaz,\ngiving its unholy leader, the Xhazobine, her epithet: the Flamemarked. After the battle, the\nCastanites fled into the Deepwoods in an attempt to lose the Xhazobin's host but eventually\nbecame  lost  within  the  cursed  wood  for  10  years in a period known as The Lost Years\nduring which Castan established himself as the leader of his people. During their time they\nsaw  the  same  silver dragon flying north which Castan saw as a sign of the way to freedom,\nwhich  later  led  the  peoples  to  meet a mysterious stranger known as The Wayguide near\nSouthmount.\n\nThe  Wayguide  eventually  became Castan's trusted advisor and encouraged Castan to seek\nout  a  new  home  "under  the  eye  of  the north twin". Castan led his peoples to settle in\nmodern-day  Castonath  whilst  he  and  The  Wayguide ventured onwards up Southmount's\nnorthern  twin:  Trialmount  to  meet  with the Silver Dragon of Castanor. During the year\nthat  Castan  was  away some of his followers lost hope and abandoned the camp, becoming\nThe  Misguided,  but  after  exactly  a  year  Castan  returned  with proclamations from the\nrevelations  he  had  gleaned  from  the  Trialmount, alone. When asked, Castan would not\nanswer where The Wayguide went."

 page_events.225.d: "\nCastanor is the general term used to refer to the various stages of Castan's Empire.\n\n==Historical Castanors==\n===Early Castan's Empire (639 BA - 471 BA)===\nThe  early  days  of  the  Empire  were  marked  with  the establishment of law and order in\nCannor as well as the continual fight between man and the wilds.\n\n===Greater Castan's Empire (471 BA - 0 BA)===\nThe  golden  age of Castanor was under Castan the Great. This period saw great expansion\nof Castanor into the rest of Cannor, as well as the Wars of Dominion against the other two\npowers of antiquity.\n\n===Late Castan's Empire (0 AA - 1021 AA)===\nThe gradual weakening of Castanor started with the Day of Ashen Skies. This is a period of\nstrife and conflict and for a long time Castanor was no longer a united polity but fought for\nby  powerful  lords  and  pretenders. At the later stages all of Castanor was unified again by\nthe foreign reaver Castan Ebonfrost, until its dissolution in the War of the Sorcerer King.\n\n===Chivalric Escann (1021 AA - 1424 AA)===\nAfter  the  War of the Sorcerer King the Trialmount which determined who would bear the\ntitle  of  Castan  was cursed and inaccessible, leaving Escann without any clear leaderships.\nEscann  collapsed  into  a  land  of  petty  kingdoms,  with  the largest at the time being the\nKingdom  of  Cast  and  Kingdom  of  Anor. Eventually the two kingdoms merged into the\nKingdom  of  Castellyr,  and the kingdom remained the dominant force in the region along\nside other kingdoms like Adenica and the Blademarches.\n\nChivalric  Escann  is noted for the custom of the Trial of Chivalry, which allowed disputes,\neven  wars,  to  be  won over by a trial-of-combat or other relevant chivalric affairs, such as\njousting. This spared Escann from many deadly wars, and for a time, the region flourished.\nMost  historians  agree  that  this  weakness  and  ill-preparation  for  war  was one of main\nfactors in the success of the Greentide of 1424, which saw the land destroyed."

 page_events.232.d: "\nCentaurs  are  a  race  believed now to have originated in the Oldwoods of Eastern Cannor,\nfrom  some  unknown  manner of fey influence. The Archfey Rohibos is often cited as their\ncreator,  but whether this is true or if he was just a major benefactor of the ancient centaurs\nis unknown. Their appearance is a mix between a horse and a human, with an equine lower\nhalf  and  humanoid  upper  body,  but  the  degree  to  which  centaurs  are related to both\nhumans  and  horses  is  both  a  matter  of  study  and  cause  for  great confusion amongst\nscholars.  While  they  originated in the Oldwoods, following a period of strife and conflict\nwith Castanor in the ancient era known as the Second Great Cleansing, centaurs have come\nto  largely  inhabit  the  deserts  and steppes of the Forbidden Plains, where the majority of\ncentaurs live to this day.\n\n===Cannorian Mythos===\nRohibos  was  one  of  several  creator deities considered to be direct Spawns of Agrados in\nCannorian  Creation  Myth.  These  deities  were allegedly born of Agrados’s defilement of\nHalanna,  and  their  offspring  were  to  be  considered  nothing more than monsters to be\npurged. This theological idea that centaurs were evil spawns born of defilement was used to\njustify Castan II Beastbane’s conquests and purges that he led against not only the centaurs,\nbut all other races branded as monsters by the First Pantheonic Council in 600.\n\n===Centaur Culture and Practices===\nMost  centaur  societies  and communities live in a steppe environment, where life revolves\naround  the  herding  and  management  of  domesticated  animals  such as sheep, goats, or\nlarger  herd  animals found in the Forbidden Plains. Centaur diets thus consist primarily of\nmeat  and  dairy products acquired from their herds. In relation to the common worship of\nthe  god  Irdaeos,  many  centaur  communities have been known to construct and dig large\ngeoglyphs  into  the  ground,  as  it is believed that their god of the sky can see them and be\nhonored.   Centaur   culture  generally  also  places  a  big  emphasis  on  spiritualism  and\nshamanism. Each tribe has a shaman who is believed to have been granted the gift of magic\nby  their  god.  Centaur  magic  tends  to  focus  on  the  mastery and manipulation of four\ndistinct  elements  and  combinations  between  them.  The  four  elements  in  the centaur\nunderstanding  are  fire,  lightning,  wind,  and  ice  (which  can  be  contrasted against the\ncommon   Cannorian   and   Sarhaly   understanding   of  the  elements  as  related  to  the\nprimordials of fire, earth, air, and water, and further contrasted against Cannorian concepts\nof magic as divided into schools rather than elements)."
 page_events.1810.t: "Centaur 2 / 7"
 page_events.1810.d: "\n\n==Religion==\n\n===Ancient Religious Beliefs===\nFollowers  of  the  ancient  centaur  religion  have a unique understanding of the concept of\ndivinity,  deities,  and religion. Practicing a form of monolatrism rather than polytheism or\nmonotheism,  followers of this system held the belief that the gods were intrinsically tied to\nthe land. Deities specifically ‘ruled’ over geographical areas, biomes, and regions, and held\n‘domains’.  While  many  parts of the Oldwoods and Escann were believed to fall under the\nauthority  of  Rohibos,  if  one  were  to leave the region, they would be in the domain of a\ndifferent,  unknown  deity, and it would be up the shamans to determine who exactly it was\nthat ruled a given area. In the ancient times, centaurs overwhelmingly chose to worship the\nArchfey  Rohibos,  who  they  believed  to  be  the  creator  of  all centaurs. Their spiritual\nleaders  (which  often  doubled  as  their  secular  leaders,  particularly  for the clans found\nwithin  the  Oldwoods)  were  known  as  Sons of Rohibos, shamans who had entered pacts\nwith  the  Archfey in return for powerful abilities. Sons of Rohibos held immense authority\nover centaurkind.\n\nThe  centaurs  unique  understanding  of  the  divine,  combined  with the manner in which\nmajor  events were interpreted by the religious authorities, is what led to the worship of the\ngod  Irdaeos  (also  known  by  other  names  today,  such  as  Shirdos  to  the  followers of\nYudyunovi) during the centuries following the Centaur Exodus.\n\n===Irdaeos Worship===\nIrdaeos  (or Shirdos) is the most commonly worshipped deity by modern centaurs. Irdaeos\nis  said to have admired the centaur’s perseverance through the hardships of the Exodus and\nto   have   granted   his   domain  (the  steppes  and  deserts  of  the  Forbidden  Plains)  to\ncentaurkind  as  their new home and promised land. His portfolio was primarily concerned\nwith  the sky, the wind, and movement itself. Due to their association with the sky, there is\na  certain  sacred  reverence  granted  to  avian  life,  and  purposefully  harming  a  bird  is\nconsidered  a  great  taboo.  There  is an almost religious fervor surrounding the concept of\nmovement  to  followers  of  Irdaeos.  The  magnitude of the effect that this has had on the\ndevelopment  of  centaur  society  cannot  be  understated,  as it led to society being almost\nentirely  nomadic  in  nature,  with  jobs  that  were  considered  sedentary  being generally\nstigmatized.  Despite  this,  many  followers of Irdaeos have managed to find ways to follow\nthe  tenets  of  their religion while simultaneously going into fields such as art or literature,\nsuch  as  Nyldrah  Fogdancer.  A renowned landscape artist, she reportedly travelled across\nmuch of Halcann, stopping to paint the locale before continuing on her journey."

 page_events.1811.d: "\n\nFollowers  of  Irdaeos  believe the Forbidden Plains to be Irdaeos’s gift to centaurkind, and\nthat  they  must  honor  his gift and show thanks to him. The belief is that if one has shown\nhonor  and  thanks  to Irdaeos in life, that they will join him in the afterlife, in the paradise\nknown  as  Ik  Magthaal,  after  they  die.  These  beliefs are central to the religion and are\ngenerally  believed  by  every single worshipper. However, several sects of the religion have\nhistorically  diverged  with  differing beliefs on what exactly the task of honoring and giving\nthanks  to  Irdaeos  entails.  The  three  most  common sects today, in order of size, are the\nsteadfast  and enduring Maslekhuga sect, the gregarious and hospitable Irdukhuga sect, and\nthe  highly  spiritual  Malukhuga  sect.  The  previously  influential and radically militarist\nFilustkhuga  sect  saw  a  majority of its followers culled by the Orachav during their initial\nexpansion into the plains.\n\n== Society and Governance ==\nPost-exodus centaur society organized itself around the clan; every individual is born into a\nclan, which they can choose to remain in once they reach adulthood. Elected from amongst\nthe  clan, the clan-head represented the clan and made decisions for all members until they\ndied,   and  a  new  clan-head  was  chosen.  Clans  can  either  choose  to  act  completely\nindependently as sovereign clans, or to organize with groupings of other clans into what are\nknown  as  ‘ordsiwyn’.  Every  clan-head within the ordsiwyn would elect an ‘ordsikar’ from\namongst  them,  who acted as the leader who would make rulings on decisions that concern\nall  member  clans.  Going  one  level  higher,  ordsiwyn can choose to organize with other\nordsiwyn  to  create  a  caehnate.

Inhabiting the Oldwoods and Taran\nPlains  of  Escann, they feuded with the early Rohibonic peoples over control of the plains.\nThe  status  quo  in  Escann  was  shattered  with  the meteoric rise of Castanor, which had\nbegun supporting the Rohibonic tribes against the centaurs. In addition, the construction of\nWhite  Walls  had  begun,  which  had  divided the centaur peoples to make them easier to\nconquer.  After the First Pantheonic Council in 600 BA which declared centaurs as Spawns\nof  Agrados,  the  Rohibonics  had completely aligned with Castanor, and the Second Great\nCleansing  officially  began  a  few  years  later in 596 BA. Swiftly united under the Sons of\nRohibos,  the  centaurs struck while the early Castanorian armies were occupied elsewhere,\nand  ravaged  Inner  Castanor,  but this did not last long, as Castan II “Beastbane” crushed\neven the united armies of centaurkind.\n\n===Centaur Exodus===\nTheir shattered retreat dividing centaurkind even further, the Centaur Exodus had officially\nbegun  at  this point. The group that had fled north was pursued by Cagod the Ranger, who\nset  up  a  checkpoint  and  made  certain  that  all centaurs who had fled north were either\nkilled  or  expelled  past  Castanor's borders into the unforgiving taiga. The group that fled\nsouth  joined  fey  resistance  groups, but after the destruction of the world tree in 579 BA,\nthe power of fey magic was significantly reduced, and the horrible defeat at Silent Lake saw\nmany  of  the  most important leaders in the resistance effort impaled in an event known as\nThe  Impalement  of  the  Fey,  to serve as a message. This group fled southeast, out of the\nOldwoods  and  into  the  hills and valleys of Firanyalen. The harpies there, also victims of\nthe  Second  Great  Cleansing, directed the centaur refugees towards the Invader’s Pass and\nthe relatively empty land beyond it."

While the Zabatlari proved to be tougher and more accustomed to\nthe  cavalry  warfare  tactics  of  the  centaurs,  the Zabatlari saw that there was little use in\ndoing  war  with  enemies  that were powerful and had little of value to lose. The Zabatlari\nunited  underneath  a  powerful  warlord  who  led  them north in search of new lands. The\nsouthern  and  northern  groups  of  centaurs  eventually regrouped in 570 BA. During this\nfateful  meeting the foundations for what would become Irdaeos Worship were established.\nMore  initially  impactful  however,  the  clans had united underneath the leadership of the\nWarlord Naegol, who promised to enact his revenge on humanity.\n\n===Naegol's Invasion===\nAt  this  time, the Four Lands of the Lakes were already embroiled in existing conflicts; the\nKhamgunai  cities  were  at  war  with  each  other, and the arrival of the Metsamics added\nnumerous  mercenary groups to the mix.

But at a fateful\nbattle  at  Bokuzqayla  in  564  BA,  in  a  surprising  moment  of  unity, the armies of all 3\nconflicting  human  parties banded together and defeated the centaurs in battle. While only\none  victory,  Naegol  had  been  slain, and the unity of the centaur invasion had crumbled.\nNow  acting  independently,  many  clan-heads and ordsikar took the initiative to lead their\nclans  and  ordsiwyn  out  of  the  lakes  and  back  out  into  the  steppes, while those who\nremained to try and push onwards found themselves losing in a war of attrition.\n\n===The Middle Eras==="
 page_events.1814.t: "Centaur 6 / 7"

Indeed, desertification combined with conflict with centaurs is\nwhat archaeologists cite to have been the downfall of the Sandmaw Ogre civilization.\n\nBeginning  in the 2nd century and stretching as late as the 9th century, there were groups of\ncentaurs  involved  in  non-violent  contact with humans, ogres, and harpies. Centaurs who\nhad  begun entering tributary relationships with the Kelaktar in the ogre valley had begun a\ntrade  route  known  as  the  Iron Chain. This route ran between Triunic settlements on the\nshores  of  Lake  Kodarve  all  the  way  to  prominent  ogre iron mines. The great distance\nbetween  these  two  locations  was  closed  by  the  centaurs  who  had  much to gain from\nparticipating   in   this   exchange.   While  this  particular  arrangement  eventually  failed\nspectacularly  in  the  aftermath  of  the  Greatfist  Coup  in 354, and ended with economic\ndownturn  for  Maghargma, and war between the Jolgik Uts and the nearby centaur groups.\nIn  6th  century  the Amber Road was established, which was a similar route that connected\nBulwari  merchants  to  the  Triunic  market,  using the endurance and speed of centaurs to\nclose  the  great  distances  between the two lands. Supported by a powerful caehnate in the\nregion  this  trade  flourished  for  several centuries. However, having learned of the wealth\nthat  lie  in  Bulwar,  several  ordsiwyn  abandoned  the  caehnate  and led an invasion into\nBulwar  in  the  year  684.  While  the  Amber  Road  lasted  for  a few decades longer, the\ncaehnate  was  weakened  by this desertion and later fell apart. With no central authority to\nensure safe passage between Bulwar and the Lakes, the Amber Road officially ended in 713\nwith the collapse of the Egoirlust Caehnate."

The tensions between\ncentaurs  and  the  humans  in  the  four lands steadily grew until they finally ignited during\nwhat  became  known  as  The  Great  Incursion  in  1433. The largest invasion force since\nNaegol  had  united  under  a  caehn  who  promised  glory  and vengeance to all. Powerful\nshamans  had  taken  advantage of a frigid winter to lock magical ice bridges into place and\ncross  the  lakes,  striking in areas that were unexpected. Unable to withstand the onslaught\nfor  much  longer,  the  Jolgik  Uts hatched a plan that nearly single-handedly won the war.\nJolgik  Ut  agents were sent deep into centaur territory to assassinate the shamans who were\nholding  the  land bridges in place, cutting off reinforcements, resupplies, and retreats. The\nlast  shaman  was slain in 1439, and the bloodbath that ensued afterwards spelled doom for\nthe  invasion. In 1441 the humans organized into the Lake Federation, in a display of unity\nand an attempt to prevent something like this from ever happening again.\n\n=== Post-Incursion Centaur History===\nThe caehnate completely collapsed over the following decade, and centaurkind was left in a\nstate   of   uncertainty.  More  united  than  ever  before  and  with  new  breakthroughs  in\ntechnology,  a  class  of  homesteading  humans  seeking  to reclaim the mainland known as\nOrachav  had  begun  expanding  into  the  plains over the following centuries. While most\ncontact between these groups was initially violent, the spread of the Yudyunovi faith proved\nto  be  a  boon  for human and centaur relations in the region, with the centaur god Irdaeos\nbeing  syncretized  with  the  god  Shirdos.

It is believed that\nover a thousand types of cheese exist on Halann.\n\n== History ==\nCheesemaking  predates  all  recorded  history,  making  it  impossible  to determine where\ncheese  was  first  invented.  Evidence of early cheesemaking has been found in some of the\noldest  ruins  and  tombs  of Cannor, Bulwar, the Serpentspine and Haless, stretching back\nmillenia.  Cheese  is however theorised to have been invented shortly after the first animals\nwere domesticated, and early societies got access to both milk and hide. The most accepted\ntheory is that cheese was an accidental discovery by early nomads who tried storing milk in\nfresh  hide  and stomach containers. The rennet from the animals stomach reacted with the\nmilk, causing it to become whey or curds.\n\n== Famous Cheese Types ==\nListed  below  are  a  selection  of  the  most  famous  or  well known cheeses from around\nHalann organised into their respective regions of origin.\n\n== Cannor ==\n\n=== Cuís Bennon ===\nAlso  known  as  Cuís  Bennon,  it is an unpasteurized cheese made from goat's milk and is\ncircular  in  shape,  around  7  cm  in diameter and 2.5 cm in height, and weighing around\n100g.

According to\nlegend,  she was left alone to stir the curd of a traditional cheese but was interrupted, either\nby  other  chores,  a  troll  raid  or  a  meeting  with  her lover. This resulted in alternating\nperiods of heating and stirring of the curdling milk.\n\nIt is a hard cow's milk cheese with tiny eyes or holes and a firm and granular texture. As in\nBrontay  Cheddar  cheese,  the  curd is heated, cut, and stirred before the cheese is molded\nand  aged.  Strong in flavor, its taste is described as somewhat like Damuceni cheese, salty,\nbut  with more bitter notes. It is light yellow in color and has a rich fat content. Vesterdalr\ncheese  must  be  aged  for at least one year, but a couple of extra months is more common\npractice.\n\nFor  some reason, Vesterdalr cheese can only be produced in the village of the same name.\nAll attempts to recreate it elsewhere have failed or produced an inferior product. There are\nmany  theories  as to why, ranging from magical properties, soil richness, hidden damestear\nmeteorite underneath the town, or just a special local bacteria.\n\n=== Aishill Blue Cheese ===\nProduced  in the foggy Sorncosti hills, Aishill Blue is a mild pasteurized natural rind cow's\nmilk  blue  cheese.

While Seovol’s talons are their universal name, other’s call them names such\nas:  eagle  talons,  Corin's  blades,  Lothane's  Tusks,  and  dragon  claws are all used. The\ncheese is a popular meal to be eaten on Corinsfall.\n\n=== Steamed Gaweter ===\nSteamed  Gaweter  is  a  cheese  originating  from  the  city of Gaweton. It was invented by\naccident  when  a  bartender  accidentally  burned  a  whole  pund of ham in an oven while\nserving  a  table  of  rich  nobles. The smoke from the meat made contact with a milk bowl\nfermenting  in  the  locker.  Once discovered, the cheese was said to have a salty, meat-like\ntaste and aroma. It quickly became a fine addition to any table in Gaweton during drinking\nparties. It is known in the Westmoors as Steamed Chums.\n\n=== Temple Cheese ===\nTemple  Cheese  is  a  pan-Cannorian  farmers  cheese  with  historical roots in the Regent\nCourts'  one-time  custom  of receiving tithes with agricultural goods including milk. Milk\nspoils easily so most farms instead produced a small eyed cheese that had its curing process\nstarted  by  mixing  in  a small batch of fermented curds. Although there was never a single\nunified  recipe  and  was  just  commonly  known as "taxation cheese", "temple cheese" or\n"regents cheese"."

Other  historical  sources  also  mention  cheese  being  used for taxation during the\nDamerian  Republic.  Today,  this  style  of  cheese once produced in churches and temples\nacross   Cannor   is   factory-made  from  pasteurized  cow's  milk  and  has  been  given  a\nstandardized recipe and name, for everyday people to enjoy as a household cheese.\n\n=== Byshade Cheese ===\nByshade  Cheese  is a variety of fresh cheese produced in Eastern Dameria. It is made with\nwhole  milk, with cream being added to enhance its flavor. It's typically served as a dessert\nor  as  a  spread  on  bread.  To  legally be considered Byshade Cheese it must contain live\ncultures.\n\n=== Gaweton Gaulder ===\nGaweton Gaulder, a hard cheese, is very popular in Gawed. The cheese is small enough to\nbe  eaten  while  drinking,  and  tastes  salty and sour, meant to be paired with Gawedi gin.\nIronically,  the  cheese  pairs  horribly  with  wine, which has led the Lorentish to decry the\ncheese  as 'The second worst thing in creation'. The cheese is mostly served in the evening,\nand is a very common cheese in pubs and other Gawedi drinking establishments.\n\n=== Varilleni Tomme ===\nThe  Varilleni  Tomme  is  a  rare and precious semi-soft cheese that is only made in small\nquantities  in  Ibevar, making it nearly impossible to find outside the Elfrealm. It’s a 1.5kg\ndisc  covered  with  the  magic-infused  pressed  grape  used  to make Varilleni Special, the\nfamous  Ibevari  glowing  wine. Thanks to that, the cheese gets infused with the smell, taste\nand glow of the grapes.\n\nLike  wine,  the  Varilleni  Tomme  can  be  kept  for  decades, and its taste becomes more\nmarked  over time, although it tends to become drier and drier as years go by. While being\na delicacy on its own, it really shines when eaten with a glass or two of Varilleni Special."

When the tax collectors are planned to come, halfling farmers don’t fully milk\ntheir  cows,  to  reduce  the  amount  they  get  taxed  on. After the tax collectors leave, the\nfarmers milk their cows a second time, getting a very fat and concentrated milk.\n\nThe  Taxman's Grief regains popularity under the Lorentish and Gawedi domination of the\nSmall Country, as it is seen as a passive means of resistance against the foreign oppressors.\n\n=== Falah's Bowstrings ===\nA  semi-hard  cheese  from  the northern regions of the Havoral Divide, it's a goat's cheese\naged  whilst  wrapped  in  the  leaves of a Hazelnut. Traditionally tied with bowstrings, it is\nconsumed  both  as  a  way for astringents of the Cult of Falah to pay homage to their deity,\nand also in various cooking purposes or as a pairing with cured meats and jams\n\n=== Pearlsedge Pearls ===\nTypically  served as a treat enjoyed with sea salt, herbs, and a sprinkling of vinegar. Cheese\npearls  are  made  by  gently  melting  a  fine  white  curd  in  a  large dish of hot water and\ncontinually  stretching  and shaping it until it forms a small ball, or pearl. These pearls are\npinched off and then allowed to cool down before being enjoyed as a dessert.\n\n=== Diver’s Caís ==="

The  last  bit  of  the  cheese  was sold to a\nnobleman,  who  had  survived  the  wreck of that barge, who had heard of the commotion.\nSince  then  it  has  become  a tradition to drop a few wheels of young cheese into the river\nduring festivals for the scrap divers to find.\n\n=== Brontay Ceodor ===\nA  Mature  rich  cheese  originating  from  the  bordertown of Brontay Point in the western\nreaches  of  the  Westmoors.

In addition to Anbenncóst and Erecen, it is also\nproduced  in  Melefcóst,  south  of  the  Moonmount,  and  in Marionaire (all of the above\nbeing located in the Damesear), as well as in the Moonisle.\n\nDamuceni  Erecean  is  made  from  unpasteurised  cows'  milk.  The  whole  milk  of  the\nmorning  milking  is  mixed  with  the  naturally skimmed milk (which is made by keeping\nmilk  in  large  shallow  tanks  to  allow  the  cream  to  separate) of the previous evening's\nmilking,  resulting  in a part skim mixture.

Dense  and  rich  in  calories,  this  cheese  is often served in fjord troll religious\nrituals with hot milk.\n\nIn  non  religious  use  it  is  commonly  served  with  a  hot  dish,  or served on its own in\nsemi-liquid  chunks.  Can  be consumed by anyone, but has a very strong taste and is quite\nfilling.\n\n=== Reaver’s Delight ===\nCurds of a blend of various Gnomish cheeses are allowed to melt partially while frying in a\nskillet  before  being  rolled  into  a  sort of cone that holds itself together. Creamy gravy if\npoured  over  and into the cone, which is wrapped with a sheet of paper, foil, or sometimes\na  towel.  This  treat  is  a  favorite  among  Reverian  sailors  leaving port and has become\npopular abroad as a treat at fairs and markets.\n\n=== Olavsborg Cheese ===\nOlavsborg  Cheese  is  an  Olavish  cheese  that  has  a  yellow wax rind (outer layer) and a\nsemi-firm  yellow  interior. It is a mild and creamy cheese. The flavour has been described\nas  "clean  and  rich,  with  a  slightly sweet and nutty flavour". It is an all-purpose cheese,\nused for both cooking and independant consumption. It has a characteristic smooth, yellow\nbody,  and  a  supple  texture.  It  is  aged  a minimum of 5 months and is distinguished by\nmedium  to large 'eye' holes. Some variations are aged a minimum of 9, 12 or 15 months.\nIt is usually produced in large wheels."

It  is  eaten  very  young, has no rind and a very soft, creamy texture and normally a\nmild and delicate flavor. It is normally circular in shape.\n\nAccording  to  bulwari  myths,  Šamdu  was  created by Pinnagar, the god of cheesemaking,\nwhen  he  was  challenged  by  Gelšibir,  the  god of shepherds, to create a cheese that even\nsomeone  with few teeth was able to eat (most Bulwari cheeses are hard cheeses). To make\nthe  cheese,  Pinnagar  stole  7  cows  from  Gelšibir and conducted them with haste in one\nnight  from  lake  Garlas  all  the  way  to  Lenaritbar in the plains. With the cow's milk he\ncreated Šamdu, and the loser Gelšibir was forced to send 7 cows from his herd to Pinnagar\neach  year.  According  to  the  legend, the one-night journey pushes animals to their limit,\nand the milk of the tired cows is what gives Šamdu its characteristic flavor.\n\n=== Asmangol ===\nEvery  few  weeks  in  the  off-season,  shepards  can  be  spotted  emerging  from  winding\nnetworks  of  caves  deep  in the mountains surrounding Asmangol, rolling waxen wheels of\nthe  eponymous  cheese down well-trodden paths to the villages below. This cheese is often\ncalled  the  pride  of  the  Gelkali,  but it is an acquired taste for those not acquainted from\nbirth - many a diplomat has regretted garnishing their meal with the proffered cheese.\n\nAs  legend  has  it,  this  unique  cheese  was created when a poor shepard was smitten by a\nharpy  journeying  past  the  cave  he rested in. Abandoning his meager lunch of ewe's milk\ncheese and stale bread, he ran to try and catch her. When he returned dejected some weeks\nlater,  he  saw  distinctive veins of orange mold throughout his forgotten lunch - these same\norange  veins  are  the  pride  of  Asmangol and its many imitators today, imparting a strong\ntanginess  and  fragrance  with a short maturation time of only a few weeks. Different caves\nproduce subtly different Asmangol, but all Asmangol is creamy, slightly moist, rindless and\nno more than 6 month aged."

The  myth  says  that  the Nanšan harpies used to give šilphadu to the bulwari\nmerchants that traveled to Vainvi Yria.\n\n=== Kogzallan Kemard ===\nOriginating  in  Kogzalla,  Kemard  is  made  from  a  blend  of sheep, goat and cattle milk\ncurdled  using  rennet before being boiled and garnished with extremely hot spices and salt.\nThe cheese is a favorite of gnolls due to its meaty texture, and its high melting point allows\nit to be grilled or fried.\n\n=== Akalšardum ===\n(Bulwari: Royal Cheese or Cheese of Kings)\n\nA  type  of  Bulwari  spiced  cheese  originating from Akalšes and the Naza Plain. Is a hard\ncow’s  milk  cheese  often  used  for  grating,  but historically was used for feeding the royal\narmies  of  Akalšes due to their long-term storage. According to scholars the name “Cheese\nof Kings” was given by Araš VIII soldiers, since the king preferred Akalšardum (seen at the\ntime as a cheese for the lowborn) over other types of cheese.\n\n=== Chosen Slice ===\nA Bulwari creation, the Chosen Slice is a prestigious cheese consumed by the Sun Elves.\n\nMade  from Gelkali Sheep milk, the cheese is coated in local wine and then left to ferment\nin  herbal  water  for  a  period  of  one  month.

It is described by\nCalas  Sina  Cymaine  as "A foodstuff made in the living image of the Dame Herself" after\nsaying  this  to  a  local  shepherd  in  public,  Calas was chased out of Sad Kuz by an angry\nmob.  Eskuz  is  made  exclusively  from  the  milk  of  the Kuzar goat, which the kuzarami\ninsists gives far superior milk to the Gelkari Mountain Goat.\n\nThe  cheese  is brined in salt sourced from in the original recipe, either from Garlas Kel or\nKuztanuz,  however  unlike  the  milk. Any salt is accepted and used for the brining. Upon\nthe  initial  introduction  of  the  cheese  to  their  neighbors,  the  clans celebrated a "great\nsuccess”  (seen  ultimately  in  hindsight  as  a  minor success) of the sale and popularity of\nEskuz.

The milk obtained from sheep or goats is strained into a\nreceptacle  of  a  convenient  size  and  is fermented. The curd that forms is first mixed and\nbroken  with  a  spoon before being poured into a bag made of cloth. The liquid is drained\noff  by  applying  pressure,  and  once  the liquid matter in the raw cheese has drained away\ncompletely,  the cheese in the bag is put into a mould of a convenient size on which weights\nare  placed,  and the mould is held for 2 hours. The cheese that is readied for consumption\nin  this manner is salted if it is not to be consumed immediately, and after 4–5 days it is put\ninto glass or earthen jars or tins full of brine for preservation.\n\nThis is a strong cheese whose preservation period can extend until the following production\nseason, Surael willing.\n\n=== Naqta Betfaziya ===\nThe  curd  obtained  from the milk in the above-mentioned manner is transferred into bags\nand  left to drain by applying pressure. It remains in this manner through a first maturation\nperiod  of  10  days.  At  the  end  of this period, the raw cheese is reduced into tiny bits by\npassing  it through a mincing machine. Salt content is adjusted and it is put once more into\nbags for a second period of maturation of 10 days under heavier weights.\n\nThe  cheese  that  is taken from under pressure is packed into sacks or goat’s skin, left for a\nfinal  period  of  maturation  of  1.5–3  months  in  a  cool  environment,  and  offered for\nconsumption afterwards.\n\nIt  is  said  that  this cheese was first made after the establishment of friendly relations with\nSeghdihr,  and  it  is  a  tradition in both Azka-Sur and Seghdihr to have the final period of\nmaturation  take place in specially dedicated rooms in the hold itself, with the first batch of\ncheese  being  shared  between the Surani family and the Dwarven clan that took part in its\nmaking in a proper banquet."

There is\nno  single  method  to  its  creation, but all methods involve making the cheese from Rothé\nmilk  and  then  fermenting  it  in  other  substances.  These  substances range from simple\nvinegar  to  spider  venom or some less pleasant things, the goblins make do with what they\nhave.\n\nRegardless  of  its  ingredients,  the  cheese  adopts  a  somewhat  greenish  hue  and a very\nnoticeable   pungent   odor   that   is   extremely   revolting   to   non-goblins.  Other  than\nconsumption,  some  clever  goblins  use  this  cheese as a form of "mousetrap". Except all\nrodents in the vicinity choose to get as far away as possible from said cheese.\n\n=== Q'visk ===\nQ'visk is a traditional Mossmouth ogre cheese that is made by boiling fresh cows milk with\nswamp  plant  life found in the Serpents Vale. As the milk is boiling, a few drops of sap are\nadded.  The  resulting  lumps  of  cheese are then left outside in the swampy air for a night\nwhich  results  in  solid and deeply pungent lumps that vary in taste depending on the exact\nplants used in the boiling process, ranging from very bitter to tasteless. Sadly this historical\ncheese died out with the swamp when the irrigation network was repaired.\n\n=== Flamerith ===\nInvented  by  Darkscale kobolds while they occupied Khugdihr along with their dragon god\nNimrith, this cattle based cheese is quite intriguing.\n\nThe  process  of  creating the cheese itself is fairly mundane. What is done after the cheese\nsolidifies is another matter entirely. The Darkscales always seek to liken themselves to their\ngod  and  this  cheese  is  no  different.  The  cheese  is  injected  with  various  alchemical\ncompounds  designed  to  increase  its  resistance to fires. Then the cheese is skewered and\nplaced  over  a  firepit  where  it  is  slowly  "cooked" as if its a hog on a spit. The cooking\ncontinues  until  the  alchemical protections weaken and the cheese begins to heat up. This\nprocess usually takes days"

It\ncame  to  be  when  the  Amethyst  Dwarf, Rungi fell into a barrel of Dwarovar Dark while\nenjoying  a piece of Hold Hog cheese. As his fellow dwarves scrambled to help him out, he\nwas quite distraught that his good cheese was still in the barrel. Moments later it floated to\nthe surface.\n\nPerhaps  due  to  his  exposure  to  all  that  Dwarovar  Dark, Rungi did not use his hands.\nInstead  he  rammed  his  head  into  the barrel and caught the cheese with his mouth. The\nlook  of  fulfillment  on  Rungi's  face  when he lifted his head could not be described. The\ndwarves  later  submerged  some  cheese  into another barrel of Dwarovar Dark. The result\nwas a very richly alcoholic and sweet cheese.\n\nIn  honor  of Rungi, the Amethyst Dwarves continued this practice of submerging cheese in\nDwarovar  Dark  and then grabbing it with their mouths. The resulting game of cheese was\nwidely  popular  in  Hul-az-Krakazol  where  many  barrels  of Rungi's Fruit were set up in\nvarious inns. This led to an increase in drunken parties.\n\n=== Zizmurr ===\nInvented  by  the  Darkscale  Kobolds  during  their  years  in  the  Caves  of  the  northern\nSerpentspine,  the  “Zizmurr”,  or  “the  Black  Wall” in common, is a round cheese, made\nfrom  the milk of Rothê. While the initial creation of the cheese corpus remains mundane,\nit  is  during  its  solidification  that  the  actual process of creating a Zizmurr begins. After\nreaching  a  certain  inner  and  outer  solidity,  a form roughly in the shape of an 8 spoked\nwheel is driven into the cheese corpus, and used to divide it into 8 equal chunks of cheese."

Hailing\nfrom  the  dwarven  Hold  of Dur-Vazathun, Stirnbul is a hard cheese, served in 1cm thick\nslices,  together  with  bread  or  other  condiments.  The full process of how this cheese is\nmade is not known, as it is carefully guarded by the odd astronomers that create it.\n\nUnder  careful  observation  one might see small, fine blue specks across the cheese. These\ncome  from  what  seems  to be a small amount of damestear dust sprinkled and mixed into\nthe  curd  during  the  cheesemaking  process,  as  well  as  blue mold that grows within the\ncheese."

The cheese itself is made from ewe's milk and various herbs found only on\nthe  surface to enrich its flavor. The cheese is then fermented in serpentbloom oil for a few\ndays.\n\nThen  the  cheese  is  "hammered"  into sheets resembling the Ramsteel the hold is famous\nfor.  These  sheets  of cheese are then used to envelop the Roasted Ram. The heat from the\nfreshly  roasted ram would then melt the cheese surrounding it, letting it seep into the meat\nitself.  Any  leftover  cheese  would  form  a puddle below the ram, serving as a convenient\n"dipping  sauce".  Unfortunately  with  the loss of the hold, the creation of this cheese was\nlost amid attempts to replicate it have failed.\n"

Obtaining it however is a different matter, you would need to\nconvince  a  Basalt  Dwarf  on  a good day to sell you some. As all dwarves know, finding a\ngood natured Basalt Dwarf is like trying to find a diamond in fertilizer.\n\nEssentially  a  rothé based cheese, it is mixed with various types of Serpentbloom including\nFirebuds. The cheese is then pasteurized with the natural heat of the volcano. After it cools\ndown,  other  spicier  types  of  serpentbloom are added to the mixture. Once the cheese is\nfully  processed,  it is cut into many small and irregular sized pieces. These pieces are then\npackaged into small leather pouches.\n\nThe resulting Magma Nuggets are then eaten as a leisurely snack by the dwarf. Most Basalt\nDwarves  keep a pouch on them at all times.

It isn't known exactly what\ncreature  the  milk  to  make the cheese comes from, but Cube Cheese is cube shaped, and\nsmall  enough  for  several  to be carried in one hand. Cube Cheese tastes extremely bland,\nwith  some going so far as to claim it tastes like nothing at all. Nevertheless, the nutritional\nfactor  of  the  cheese,  coupled  with its low cost of production and small size, has made it\nvery common amongst Obsidian Legion soldier's rations.\n\n=== Father's Vengence ===\nNot  much  is  known  about  this  cheese due to its origins. This is a cheese made from an\nunknown  animal  deep  in  the  Primeval  Serpentdepths  by  none other than the Obsidian\nDwarves.  The  cheese  is  allegedly  made  by  fermenting  it  in a runic circle of unknown\ncharacteristics for a year. The circle is maintained by a select few Runesmiths.\n"

Since  they  lacked  many  of  the  surface  animals  that  allowed  for easy curd\ncreation,  the  Artificers  of the Underneath began a series of discombobulated experiments\nto  enhance  the  flavor,  texture,  and  most  importantly,  the  delivery,  of such wonderful\ncheeses.  This  would  result  in  such  wonderful creations, including "Gouda Gobbléans"\n(sold  alongside  its  trademark  "Cheeseapult"),  as  well  as  "Custard  Gas"  (which was\nmarketed as a cheese, despite clearly not being a cheese).\n\nThough  these  cheeses  all  bore  the  seal  of  Vez  Udzenklan, it quickly became common\nknowledge  that the Gobblivion Ferments were simply imported Cannorian cheeses loosely\nprocessed  then  sold  at a steep markup. The cheese itself was vile, but the cheese delivery\ndevices   included  in  the  sales  were  far  beyond  their  time  in  mindless  and  decadent\nentertainment: catapults that delivered curds directly into your mouth, gaseous cheeses that\ncould  be  inhaled  like  flavored  air  (which was also used as a torture device), and cheese\nconfetti that had a nasty habit of getting stuck on your earlobes.\n\n=== Chieftain's Honor ===\nOriginating  from  the  Serpentspine,  this  invention  of  the  Black Orcs has a much more\npractical  application  than  other  cheeses.  The  cheese  itself  is  made  from  any  nearby\nmilkable animal. It is left to ferment for weeks in multiple Black Orcish spirits, grog being\nthe most common.\n"

This constant conflict is what led to the\ncreation  of this cheese. Made from sheep milk, the cheese is mixed with a myriad of herbs\nfound around the Giant's Anvil. It is then fermented in a serpentbloom mixture made from\na very specific serpentbloom plant found only within the Anvil.\n\nThe  cheese  itself  is  quite  sour  and  is  usually  cut into small wheels and placed in each\nsoldier's  rations.  It  is  extremely  nutritious  and  a soldier can survive on a single cheese\nwheel  for  at  least three days. With the loss of their surface outposts, the Quartz Dwarves'\nability to make this cheese was severely hampered. It is now restricted to only commanders\nand above.\n\n=== High King's Best ===\nYou would think this cheese originated from Amldihr but you would be wrong. This cheese\nwas  made  by  the  Jade  Dwarves  of  Grônstunad after proclaiming themselves as the new\nHigh  King.  The  cheese  was  first  made at the height of the Jade Empire using cow milk\nfrom  Rahen.  Access  to  Rahen  meant  they  were  not  limited  to Dwarovar ingredients.\nMultiple types of nuts are embedded into the cheese giving it a somewhat crunchy texture."

This cheese's production was started by Drozma\nTur  monks  but  it  has since been spread among the common populace, though the cheese\nproduced  in  the  monasteries  remains the more prized variety. Urthid Modna has a salty,\nspicy,  and  somewhat  nutty flavor, it is firm in texture and comes in large aged wheels, 60\ndays at minimum though usually up to a year. Every Urthid Modna produced by the monks\nis  branded  with  a dragon bearing a flower, distinguishing them from common varieties of\nthe cheese."

The name "Dibe'no'ne" (of Dibe'no)\ncomes  from  a  popular  Hoila'kosu  legend,  in  which the founder of the Kinah, Dibe'no\nHoila'kosu, provided the entire city of Tilsi'teàh with food, notably cheese, in 801 AA, the\ndate of the first Day of Bounty's Choosing.\n\n=== Corin's Rest ===\nCorin's  Rest  is a cheese produced in Corinsfield. It's an aged hard cheese commonly sold\nin  wheels, and has a rather bland flavor. What makes Corin's Rest notable isn't the cheese\nitself, but rather the wax that entombs it.\n\nThis  wax  is  dyed a bright, fiery red; this is done by the use of Corinspoppies. The opium\ncontent  of  the  Corinspoppy  sap  leeches  into  the wax and, after long periods of storage,\nbleeds  into  the  cheese  as  well, giving it a distinctive pinkish hue. Therefore, for reasons\nthat  weren't  known  until  studied  by  the  chroniclers  much later, the cheese produces a\nsedative effect on the consumer."

The ogre chef\nintentionally  exposes  the  cheese  to flies to lay their eggs in. Once the maggots hatch they\nwill  start  continuously  digesting  the  cheese,  resulting  in  a very soft, even partly liquid,\ntexture.  While  rejected  as horrific by most other races in the region, the cheese became a\nhit  among  Maghargma's  goblin immigrant community. After improved infrastructure was\nbuilt  through  the  Spider  Tunnels,  attempts  have  been  made  to  spread the dish to the\nAllclan  goblins  as  well, using imported flies from Maghargma. As goblins lack the strong\nstomach  acids of the ogres, this has sometimes resulted in cases of goblins falling ill due to\ncheese maggots surviving and feeding inside the goblins intestines.\n\n=== Great Pot Cheese ===\nGreat  Pot  Cheese is the name for a number of cheeses manufactured by the Garsvulshim,\nwhere  aged  goat  cheese  is cooked in large copper vats during the manufacturing process.\nThe resulting flavor is typically much more buttery in consistency.\n\nThe  cheese  gets  its  name  from the primary means by which it is consumed; traditionally\nmelted   together   in   a  massive  cauldron  and  augmented  with  fruits,  nuts,  and  most\ncommonly  different  types  of  alcohol.

It  is  then  dried  rock hard and stored for up to years at a time. When eaten, it is\nfirst  softened up over the heat of a fire, resulting in a distinctive aroma. The cheese is said\nto  make  a  squeaky  noise  when  bitten  into.  Bread  cheese  is preferably made with the\nso-called  "first  milk" from an animal that has just calved, as this milk is seen as the most\ndelicious.

The  taste itself can be described as an improvement over both the fruit\nand  the cheeses of its time, as the cheese blended well with the fruit itself, producing some\nof  richest  savory  and sweet tastes over any other cheese. Most people chose not to eat the\ncheese  though,  due  to  the  stinky  odor,  but those who do, would claim it to be the best\ncheese  in  Halann.

Its\nname,  which  means  "beaten  milk"  in the Shuvüüshudi language, comes from its unique\ncuring  process: the curd was fermented in cleaned terror bird gizzards, which were put in a\nbag hanging on the door frame of yurts. According to tradition, guests were supposed to hit\nthat  gizzard  with  their  fists  once  when visiting the yurt to intimidate face-stealing spirits\nthat  followed  them. When the tribe moved, these bags were either tied below bird saddles\nfor  the  same  effect  during  a day of riding. It can be soaked in tea or soup at mealtime to\nsoften  before  eating  or  as  a  snack  to  meet  the herders' need for calorie replenishment\nduring  a  full  day  of  herding. Neighboring sedentary people adopted it into their cuisine.\nPeople  in  the  border  town  of Jiangmok called it Dahruu, replacing egg white with yolk,\nand  stuffed  them  in steamed buns.

The term, whose\nearliest   recorded   usage   was   found  by  chroniclers  in  an  ancient  Oni  scroll  within\nHeiyukcheng,  has  come  to  mean a variety of different things to various cultures. Though\nsome of these cultures, namely followers of High Philosophy, Lefthand Path, and Righteous\nPath  have  differing  practices  and  interpretations,  there is one such concept they have in\ncommon.  Vitality.  Spread  through  Harimar's  conquests,  the  idea  of  chi  representing\nvitality,  or  one's  own  life-force,  became  widespread  throughout  these  religions  if not\nalready  a  part.  Those  in  Haless  have  traditionally believed that your breath is in fact a\nvisualization  of  chi  flowing throughout your body. It should be noted that these beliefs do\ndiffer from followers of the Mystic Accord.\n\n==In Culture==\n\n\n===High Philosophy===\nTo  followers  of  High  Philosophy, chi, or "atma" to them, is essential in maintaining the\nbalance  of  one's  life.

For those\nin  the  lower  castes  there  is  a  stronger  focus  on  simple  healthy living and exercising,\nmaintaining  a healthy body creates a healthy chi. The further you go up the societal ladder\nof  Rahen  the more complex the techniques go for maintaining one's chi. The scholars, for\nexample,  believe  that  a  healthy  brain  is  what  leads  to a balanced chi, to a degree that\nextensive  documentation  has  been  found  regarding  precise calculations and geometry to\nmaximize the balance of rock gardens on their chi.\n\nThe  primary  importance  of  balancing  chi  to these followers is the impact that it has on\none's  personality.  One's own chi, svayatma, while healthy will lead to positive traits and a\nmore productive person, the opposite is also true. Negative chi can lead to one becoming a\ncriminal,  or  worse.  Many  mental  illnesses are attributed to this negative chi. There is a\nfirm  belief  that  one's  chi,  whether  negative or positive, is fully under the control of the\nindividual and their sole responsibility to balance."
 page_events.1847.t: "Chi 2 / 4"
 page_events.1847.d: "\n\nBeyond the chi of one self, there is the chi of the world and the chi of existence. The chi of\nthe  world,  called  visvatma,  finds  itself in the many elements that make the world move,\nand the balance of those elements. It is believed that the High Temples aid in balancing the\nworld's  chi, and if the temples are neglected, ruined, or derelict, they will slowly offset the\nbalance  of  the  world's chi, leading to natural disasters like monsoons, volcanic eruptions,\ndust storms, etc.\n\nChi  of  existence,  or tamatma, is the chi one can find within the very fibers of reality. The\nchi that represents and is maintained by strong central authorities, like historically the Raj.\nIf  this  chi  starts  becoming  unbalanced,  turmoil,  rebellion,  disaster,  and  poor fortune\noccurs.  They  attribute  the  many  pitfalls  that  faced  Harimar  and Jaher results of them\nunbalancing  this  chi,  and  though Harimar took care to ensure this chi was restored Jaher\ndid not, causing the collapse of his empire.\n\n===Righteous Path===\nUnlike  the  High  Philosophy, the Righteous Path believes chi to be far more metaphysical\nthan  spiritual.  Whilst  at  its  core  it  is  still  one's  vitality,  a  person's  focus  is not on\n"balancing"  their  chi  but  refining  and  growing  it. Within the Righteous Path there is a\nprimary  divide  of  both  usage  and  attainment  of chi between the Xianjie monks and the\nmore rural regions of Haless Proper.\n\nTo Xianjie monks, chi can be harnessed and cultivated by martial arts and meditation. This\nchi  can  then  be  used  as more than merely a tool to them, but an extension of one's will.\nAmong  the  many  disciplines  and schools of Xianjie monks, therein comes a multitude of\ntechniques  to  represent  this  extension.  Some  focus  on  fighting to hone their chi into a\nphysical  point,  allowing them to express it in a more physical manner such as The Way of\nthe  Dancing  breeze  which  is  renowned for deflecting bullets. In contrast to this physical\nstyle,  there  is  The  School  of Deep Fog which combines their chi with a unique tobacco,\ncreating  illusions.  Many of these less physical arts focus instead on meditation, cultivating\none's overall chi and honing it mentally. They believe this allows one's thoughts to open up\nto  the  wider  world,  leading to enlightenment. Ultimately, the monks believe that to truly\nbecome  a  Xianjie  master  you  must  have  reached  a  level  of  both physical and mental\nenlightenment."
 page_events.1848.t: "Chi 3 / 4"
 page_events.1848.d: "\n\nAccording to folklore, once a monk has achieved the highest level of enlightenment they go\nout  to  live  in  isolation atop the various misty mountain peaks, remaining there except in\ntimes  of  need.  Many  young  apprentices,  and even sage monks, make pilgrimages to pay\nhomage to enlightened monks and ask them for guidance and advice on their own path.\n\nIn  regards  to the more rural beliefs around chi, it is still believed that one can cultivate it,\nbut  this  takes  many different roots. Due to the uncentralized nature and folkish origins of\nRighteous  Path, it is difficult to detail every single belief. One highly popular belief is that\nsimply  doing your job with diligence, as a farmer or more, can aid in your chi growth, and\ndoing  so  makes  your  vitality stronger. Others believe rituals, dancing, festivals, and even\ntaking care of one's family are the best ways to help one's chi prosper.\n\nDespite  the  differences  on  why  and how one cultivates chi, the techniques to preserve it\nremain  fairly  universal  among  the Righteous Path. Chronicler Aleyissa Wu notes several\nbeliefs  such  as  staying indoors at night stops your chi from escaping in the form of breath\nand  burying the dead deeper than needed helps retain their chi. The belief is that one's chi\ndoes  not  fade  with  death,  but if you are dead and not properly buried then you risk your\nchi  escaping  and  becoming  the clouds in the sky. In this case you will return as a restless\nspirit, unable to rest at ease. On the other hand, being buried properly will result in a calm\nand protective spirit, who safeguards their descendants from malevolent ones.\n\n===Lefthand Path===\nWidely  considered  the  most antagonistic of the various Halessi beliefs, the Lefthand Path\ndoes  not care for self cultivation with exception of the oni, instead focusing on self-desires,\npractices,  and  magics.  Chi belongs to the strong, and it is only nature that the strong will\ntake  the  chi  of  the  weak.  There  is  no goal of harmony in this faith, only strengthening\noneself by taking from another.\n\nNot  simply  being  a  vital  force  to  them,  chi is also raw power. How one's chi is taken\ndiffers  from  group  to  group,  but  the  most  prominent chi stealers are the Jiangshi, who\nlearnt  from  secrets  the Oni had left behind during their retreat from Yanshen. They drain\nthe lifeforce, the chi, of their victims directly, resulting in their victims dying from this lack\nof  vitality, and if the Righteous Path is to be believed, preventing them from returning as a\nspirit."
 page_events.1849.t: "Chi 4 / 4"
 page_events.1849.d: "\n\nIn  a  notable  difference  from their human brethren who are fully chi stealers, the Oni are\nsaid  to  already be born with a great abundance of chi. While practicing chi stealing, as all\nLeft Hand Path adherents do, they also meditate and are capable of self cultivating their chi\nfrom  within their temples. A method unique to them is the act of ritualistically consuming\na  person,  consuming  their chi that way. Both they and the other adherents also take to the\npractice of draining spirits for this chi.\n\n===Mystic Accord===\nDifferentiating  from  the  other  three  major  groups  of  Haless,  Mystic  Accord Chi is a\nspiritual  energy  born  from the spirit realm instead of a vital force. This energy permeates\nand  drowns  the  land in this spiritual energy, allowing one to make use of it. Every person\nstill  retains  their  own  chi,  for  every  person  has  a  spirit.  Once dead they believe this\nspiritual  energy  should  be  freed,  allowed  to  wander and return to the spirit realm if so\ndesired,  and  if  not it will either become part of the energy that covers the world or return\nin the form of an ancestor spirit.\n\nAll  spirits  are  believed to be made out of this energy, this chi, especially the Great Spirits\nwho  are  tremendous  sources  of  it.  It  is  unknown if spirits are caused by chi becoming\nconcentrated  in  particular  areas,  or  if  they  have always been around, but regardless the\nadherents of the Mystic Accord worship these Great Spirits.\n\nIn practice, Mystic Accord believes this spiritual energy can be used in a multitude of ways.\nThe  Shrine  Maidens  of  Yinquan for example, make use of this spiritual energy in dances\nand rituals, either to use magic or to please the Huli Jing, the spirits they worship.\n\n== Black Damestear ==\nBlack  Damestear,  or  Korashi,  has  had  numerous experiments conducted in terms of its\nrelation  with chi. The general consensus reached is that Black Damestear is able to nullify\nchi  when  it  is  used to express magic, such as nullifying a chi blast or the enhancement of\none's body using chi. It, however, can not nullify chi techniques such as enhancing reflexes\nthrough controlled breathing and the such."

The land used to create Akuutengen was taken\nfrom  Länkuuhsta  and  Vahjevgiiv, being punished by the newly organized Lake Federation\nfor  their  earlier  conquests.

Founded in 900 AA to be the new capital of the Ynnic\nEmpire,  Arverynn has been one of the largest cities in the Ynn and the capital of the ruling\npowers of Sarda for much of its history.\n\nIt  is  located  at  the  confluence of the Arverynn and Lunynn rivers which run by the city's\nwestern  limit.  Great  walls  contour  the  city's perimeter with particular emphasis on the\neast.\n\n==Founding and Imperial Apex==\nArverynn  was  founded  by  Emperor  Calrodiy  I in 900 AA at the site of the Battle of the\nArverynn.  A  frontier  capital, Arverynn could ward off incursions from Veykoda, while its\ncentral  positioning between Sarda and Dolindha made it a trade hub between the Empire's\nmain  regions  and  gave  Imperial  battalions  a  base  that  could strike at either in case of\nrebellion.\n\nPreviously  a  town named Bauros stood where Arverynn was founded. Emperor Calrodiy I\nordered  the  renovation  of  pre-existing  buildings and the construction of a great artificial\nmound  named Vyrisar Hill. The Teal Keep was built on top to provide lavish housings for\nthe knights and military.\n\nFrom  its original fortified core around the Teal Keep, Arverynn sprawled in all directions,\nwith  broader  walls  being  raised  to cover its perimeter. Arverynn became the largest and\nmost  populous  city of the Ynnic Empire, and historians debate whether or not it surpassed\neven Nanru Nakar, the queen of Ruinborn cities.\n\n==Shrinking and Resurgence==\nSince  the Dark Ages of the Ynn, Arverynn underwent the same urban decline as the rest of\nthe Ynn, and by the Age of Greentide it resembled a collection of villages and communities\nrather  than  a  sprawling  city.  This  was  in  part  because  the  mages  of Arverynn casted\nillusionary  magic  to hide the abandoned buildings, replacing them with gardens, meadows\nor  trees.

As well as their involvement in leading the lesser cities of the Guvkeshevdel on\nseveral occasions, resulting in its nickname.\n\n== History ==\nIt  was  founded  in  669  BA  as  a  village  of  shepherds.  The  city's  primary exports are\nlivestock,  horses, and leather. The early village of Khirntozgon was blessed with a peaceful\nenvironment  that  nurtured  a  sense of calm and tranquility within their lands, standing in\nsharp  contrast  to  the  bustling  cities  that  surrounded  them. For centuries, Khirntozgon\nmaintained  a  trustworthy  and  honorable  relationship  with  its allies, the Guvkeshevdel.\nOver  time, they had found valuable contacts to send their herds to, including Haraigizenhi\nBulrek, who was eager for their mare's milk to ferment into Haraig.\n\nToday,  Khirntozgon  is  interspersed  with  open  parks  and stables. It remains a small city\ncompared  to  others  in the Lake Federation, but it is an important part of the federation's\neconomy. The city's location makes it a hub for livestock and horse-trading, and its leather\nindustry  is  also  thriving.  The bureaucrats of Khirntozgon have taken great care to ensure\nthat  the  city's  economy  remains  sustainable,  balancing  the  needs of the herds with the\nneeds of the people.\n\n== Economy and Industry ==\nKhirntozgon's rise to prominence began with the founding of Haraigizenhi Bulrek, a nearby\ncity  of  brewers.  The  city's  creation represented a new market and use for Khirntozgon's\ncattle and horses, and the two cities flourished together.\n\nAlthough  Khirntozgon  is  one  of  the  largest  cities  in  its  vicinity,  it  has  never been a\nsignificant power. However, it has been a part of every incarnation of Ghuvgeshevdel as the\nleader  of  the  lesser  cities  of  the  alliance,  earning  the  city  its  nickname, "The Little\nBrother.""

The city's militiamen have a\nreputation for being fierce and loyal defenders of their home, and they are frequently called\nupon to assist neighboring cities in times of crisis.\n\nOriginally  founded  as  a  response to cattle and horse thieves. This resulted in most of the\nmilitia  being  directly  tied  to  their  homelands,  often  defending  their  own  ranches  or\nfarmsteads, making them highly motivated.\n\nThe revered Khirntozgonori horse was also bred and raised in such large numbers that their\nmilitia  was  said to be able to use them as pack horses, allowing them to march faster than\nany other infantry force in the lakes.\n\nThe  generals  of  Khirntozgon  are  also  highly skilled at organizing their troops to march,\noften jokingly concluding that “herding humans was quite similar to herding cattle.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

In 1015, Weylam fought in the relief of Calasandur, part of the war of\nthe  sorcerer-king,  where he was killed during the fighting. Afterwards, due to Colm's age,\nit  was  decided  that  he  would  be  in a regency for two years, and that his advisors would\nhandle the day to day running of the clan.\n\nColm  would argue against almost every decision the regents made, to the point where they\noften  gave  in  and  relented.  This earned him the nickname 'Callous Col' in response. In\n1017,  his  regency  ended as he reached 16 years old, and he became count of Cockerwall\nin his own right.\n\n== The Feuds ==\nAfter  becoming  a  count,  Colm  began to partake in the many feuds that were going on in\nthe  Westmoors,  longstanding  grudges between clans. This began with border raids, which\nby  1019 had progressed to full scale warring between Cockerwall and multiple clans. This\nended  with  multiple  smaller  clans being wiped out, while the larger clans were forced to\nkneel to the Cockerwalls.\n\n== The First King of the Westmoors ==\nBy 1030 Colm had subjugated most of the clans, resulting in him inviting every clan in the\nWestmoors  to  his  keep.  Once there, he announced that he was now the 'first King of the\nWestmoors'.   While   the   majority   of   the  clans,  having  been  cowed  by  Colm  into\nsubmission, some resented his rule, and saw him as a brutal tyrant. The most prominent of\nthese clans was the Cotterseas,\n\nColm   spent  much  of  his  reign  quelling  rebellions,  reinforcing  his  control  over  the\nremaining   loyal   clans,   and   establishing  foreign  ties  with  many  of  the  surrounding\nkingdoms,  most notably the Kingdom of Gawed. Over the years, Colm grew to admire the\ngawedi greatly, referring to them as 'our refined cousins'. He began to wear gawedi clothes,\nredesign  his  keep  into a gawedi castle, and in a speech to his subjects in 1047, named his\nclan as 'House Cockerwall' instead of 'Clan Cockerwall'. This increasing gawedi influence\ncaused  more  clans  to  join  the  more traditional Cotterseas, decrying the Cockerwalls as\nforeign."

It isn't known if it was by bandits,\nCottersea  loyal  soldiers, or his own guards, as the only survivor of the skirmish was Colm\nhimself.  Wounded,  he  rode  back to his castle, where he collapsed right outside the gate.\nAfter being helped to his bed, he named his son as the new king of the Westmoors and died\nthereafter.

 page_events.268.t: "Conclave of Elynáile 1 / 5"
 page_events.268.d: "\nThe  Conclave  of  Elynáile  was  a  long  running  meeting  of the various Wood Elf sallas'\n''Ceanns''  and  ''Ceannas'' to discuss the creation of an alliance to defend the Wood Elves\nagainst  the  Greentide  Invasion  of Deepwoods. Despite long standing misgivings between\nthe clans, the conclave was successful, ending in the creation of the Verdant Pact.\n\n== Background ==\nBy  year  1441  ,  the  Greentide  had  ripped  through  much  of  the  Deepwoods  and by\nextension  the  Wood  Elf  lands.  The  eastern  clans  of Salla Scotha and Salla Ahain were\nnearly  destroyed and totally displaced from their home. The clans of Salla Myna and Salla\nFealgarn had been devastated and sheared of half of their traditional lands. Salla Cenág was\nnearly  entirely cut off from the other clans while Salla Drennen was pushed to the brink of\ndestruction.\n\nIt  was  in  this dire circumstance that the ''Ceanna'' of Salla Drennen, Narawen Drennen,\nconcluded  that  her  clan  and  all  other  clans  would  be  soon  destroyed if nothing soon\nchanged.  This  change  would come in the form of the unprecedented call to all ''Ceanns''\nand ''Ceannas'' of the Wood Elf sallas to meet in the city of Elynáile. Of the nine clans, all\nbut Salla Ghúl would answer her call.\n\n== Timeline ==\n\n=== The Leaders Arrive ===\nThe  conclave  began  in  1442, when the various elven leaders from across the Deepwoods\nfinished  arriving  in  Elynáile. It would be the first time in all of Wood Elven history there\nwas such a gathering of elven leadership. Despite this historic moment, or perhaps because\nof  it,  the conclave would immediately open to shouting matches and endless arguments as\ncenturies  of  grievances  were  aired  out. The following days would prove little different as\nthe  elven  leaders  continued  to  lay  their  complaints  into each other. It was not be until\nNarawen  stepped  into  the  role  of mediating between the elven leaders that they began to\nmake progress, and as the conclave continued, the Drennen ''Ceanna'' quietly become ''de\nfacto''  chair  of  the  conclave as she spent most days arbitrating between the various Wood\nElf leaders."
 page_events.1860.t: "Conclave of Elynáile 2 / 5"
 page_events.1860.d: "\n\nWhile  most  of  the  older  grievances  would  prove to be resolvable, the issues of the past\ndecade  would  be  far more difficult. According to surviving records, they most prominent\nissues were:\n#Cenága  fury  toward  Salla  Drennen  over  the  Arun  Drennen  incident  that  ultimately\nresulted in the death of ''Ceanna'' Alara Cenág's two brothers.\n#The  eastern  clans of Scotha and Ahain anger over Oberon Fealgarn's decision to lead the\nGreentide into their lands to save his own clan.\n#Bricena  Myna  and  Cinrthir  Elyn disputing whether Salla Elyn betrayed its alliance with\nSalla Myna when it abandoned Myna's campaign against Beasteater to defend its own land.\n#Oberon  directing  blame  for the Greentide toward Salla Myna and Elyn for pushing orcs\ninto the eastern groves, starting with his people's land.\nAs  the  leaders  became  increasingly  mired  in  these  topics, the conclave would roll into\n1443.  By  anniversary  of  the  conclave,  little  true  progress  had  been made toward any\nalliance.  Instead,  the  days would be spent cycling between the above topics with Narawen\ndeftly  preventing  any  one topic from becoming too heated. It would only be the arrival of\nthe  avatar Corin and her circle in the spring that the conclave's impasse would come to an\nend.\n\n=== Outside Interruptions ===\nAccording  to  contemporaries  of  the  time, Corin would enter the Deepwoods in 1443 in\nsearch of Fey aid against the main Greentide host in Escann. After unintentionally crossing\nthe  Verdant  Veil,  she  unexpectedly  encountered  the elves of Salla Myna during a battle\nwith  orcish  Beasteater  Clan.  Upon  learning  of  the  ongoing  conclave  in Elynáile, she\nresolved to meet with elven leaders and gain their assistance.\n\nOn  arrival  in  the  city,  Corin found herself barred from any entering the conclave due to\ntheir mistrust of this outsider. Undeterred, she instead snuck into the conclave with the aid\nof   her   companions.   Making  their  way  to  meeting  room  where  the  ''Ceanns''  and\n''Ceannas'',   the   avatar   reportedly   broke   the  doors  open,  interrupting  the  ongoing\narguments."
 page_events.1861.t: "Conclave of Elynáile 3 / 5"
 page_events.1861.d: "\n\nThis  interruption,  combined with the sudden appearance of a human and a number of her\ncompanions,  proved  stunning  enough  that  Corin  was  able  to  give a passionate speech\nrequesting  the  Wood  Elves rally to fight against the orcs in the Escann. Unfortunately for\nCorin, upon finishing her speech the Wood Elves regained their composure, with ''Ceann''\nCinrthir  immediately  ordering  the arrest of the intruders. When it looked that Corin and\nthe  rest would resist, the chamber guards along with ''Cean'' Oberon and ''Ceanna'' Alara\nmoved  in to subdue the intruders. Yet, before steel could clash, one guard revealed himself\nto  be  a  glamoured  Arun  Drennen.  With  revelation throwing the room into chaos once\nmore,  Arun  invoked  a  powerful  spell  to  successfully teleport himself and Corin's party\naway.\n\nSome  moments  after  Arun's  appearance  and  the party's escape, ''Ceanna'' Alara Cenág\ndecried the conclave and Narawen Drennen. She then declared her clan's involvement over\nand   her   intent   to  hunt  down  Arun  Drennen  before  storming  away.  The  remaining\n''Ceanns'' and ''Ceannas'' soon departed declaring the conclave over leaving only Narawen\nalone.\n\n=== Saving the Conclave ===\nThe  same  night  after  the  apparent  collapse  of  the conclave, the fugitive Arun Drennen\nmanaged  to  meet with his grand-niece Narawen. After taking her to the hideout where he,\nCorin,  and  the  rest were hiding, he then requested aid for the party and himself to escape\nElynáile.  By  doing  so,  Narawen  would  enable the Wood Elf mage and Corin to kill the\narchfey known as the Eldest and free the Wood Elves from the Verdant Veil.\n\nRealizing  she  had  a chance to salvage the conclave with this information, Narawen agreed\non  the  condition  she  be  allowed  to  bring  help.  With  the  party  tentatively  agreeing,\nNarawen  moved  to  meet her fellow ''Cenna,'' Alara. Despite Alara's disdain toward her,\nNarawen  managed  to convince her cousin to follow her by revealing that she knew Arun's\nlocation."
 page_events.1862.t: "Conclave of Elynáile 4 / 5"
 page_events.1862.d: "\n\nTrue  to her word, Narawen then brought Alara to Arun. While the resulting confrontation\nalmost resulted in violence, Alara was ultimately convinced to listen to Arun before moving\nto         kill         him.         It         was        then        that        she        learned        the\n[https://anbennar.fandom.com/wiki/Verdant_Veil#Origins  truth]  about the origins of the\nVerdant  Veil.  Furthermore,  Arun  explained  the  Alara's younger brother Eledas was not\nmurdered  by  Arun but by the Eldest. By slaying the Eldest, Eledas' murder would be both\navenged  and  his  dream  of freedom for the Wood Elves achieved. Though hesitant, Alara\nagreed  to  work  with  Narawen  and  thus enable Corin, Arun, and the rest of the party to\nescape and destroy the Verdant Veil.\n\nHaving managed to win over Alara, Narawen was then able to convince the other Wood Elf\nleaders  to  remain.  The resolution of the Cenága-Drennen conflict proved to be a catalyst\nfor  Bricena  Myna  and  her  father-in-law  Cinrthir  Elyn to resolve their own differences.\nWhile  the  issues  between  ''Ceann''  Oberon  and  the  eastern clans remained, the other\ncollective breakthroughs enabled the conclave to continue.\n\n=== Birth of the Verdant Pact ===\nWith some level of trust established, the clans led by Narawen began to lay the foundations\nof  an  alliance  to  take  back  the Deepwoods. Questions of leadership and other sensitive\ntopics  were  left vague with the simple goal of reclaiming the Deepwoods being elevated as\nthe  main  purpose  of  the  alliance.  By  the  summer  of 1443, the present ''Ceanns'' and\n''Ceannas'' came to a signed agreement. The Verdant Pact was born.\n\n=== Sallas Scotha and Ahain's Departure ===\nAs  the  conclave  to  a  close,  the  newly formed alliance was left with decision on its first\nmoves.  Unfortunately,  the  lack  of  detail with respect to leadership and decision-making\nthat   enabled   to  Verdant  Pact  to  come  to  fruition  would  prove  problematic  almost\nimmediately  when  Oberon shut down Sallas Scotha and Ahains' request for the alliance to\nprioritize  the  liberation  of  their  groves.  Instead,  he  countered that the alliance's focus\nshould  be  linking  the  groves still under elvish control. The strategy’s apparent soundness\n(as well as matching the not-so-secret goals of the other clan leaders) resulted in agreement\nfrom  every  clan except Scotha and Ahain. Furious that the elf who was responsible for the\nloss  of  their  homes was also preventing them from claiming their homes back, Ahain and\nScotha would leave the alliance and Elynáile."
 page_events.1863.t: "Conclave of Elynáile 5 / 5"
 page_events.1863.d: "\n\n=== Conclusion ===\nThough the departure of Salla Ahain and Scotha would leave a bitter taste for Narawen, the\nconclave  as  whole  would  proceed  without  any  notable issue. Aside from few revisions,\nOberon's  strategy  was  adopted  by  the  remaining clans with little conflict. With the last\norders  of  business  concluded, the conclave's waning days would be spent on cordial feasts\nand   other   social   gatherings,  a  sign  of  a  growing  trust  between  the  ''Ceanns''  and\n''Ceannas''.  By  summer's start, the various leaders had begun to return to their respective\ngroves, marking an end to the Conclave of Elynáile.\n\n== Legacy ==\nConclave  of Elynáile would prove to be one of the most pivotal events in the history of the\nDeepwoods.  The formation of the Verdant Pact would sow the seeds that would enable the\ncreation  of  the  Wood  Elven  state  of  Cyranvar. In addition, the conclave was pivotal to\nuniting  Corin with Arun Drennen , ultimately leading to the death of the Eldest and end of\nthe Verdant Veil.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

She assumed Agrados place in the Regent Court as the new Goddess of War, due\nto her being the inheritor of his power after her death in 1444 AA.\n\n==Early Life==\nCorina  was  born  on  the 23rd of Bloomsend in 1420 and was raised by her mother in the\nforest  of  Canreced  on  the  border  of  Eswall.  It is believed that her mother, a theorized\npriestess  of  Agrados,  isolated  herself and Corina due to fears of prejudice from the local\nRegent  Court temple. In 1424, the orc invasion known as the Greentide devastated Eswall\nand  the  surrounding  settlements,  leaving  Corina  orphaned.  She  was  taken  in  by  the\nwandering  knight  Frederic  síl  Bennon,  who adopted her and took her on as a squire. To\nensure  that  she could serve as his squire and receive a martial education despite Esmarias'\ntraditional gender roles, Frederic renamed the child Corin so she could pass as a boy.\n\n==Lilac Wars==\nIn  order  to  fulfill her role as a squire and receive a martial education, Corin presented as\nmale   throughout  her  childhood.  Under  the  guidance  of  Frederic  síl  Bennon,  Corin\nexcelled  in  the  art  of  combat  and warfare. Though not formally a member of House síl\nBennon, she was introduced to the Síl Bennons as Frederic's bastard son. She was afforded\nthe  privileges  of  a noble upbringing and received a proper education, including lessons in\nchivalrous  conduct.  She gained a reputation for her martial skill and sense of duty, though\nmany  described her as timid outside of battle. As a squire, Corin participated in numerous\nbattles,   culminating   in  the  Invasion  of  the  Damesear  and  the  subsequent  battle  of\nAnbenncóst  in  1443.

The goal of\ndefeating  a  great  enemy  in  a  last-stand  effort, in defense of the innocent resonated with\nboth  Frederic and Corin. The resulting Battle of Rottenstep was a disaster, often described\nas  a massacre rather than a proper battle. Due to the chaotic nature of the battle, accounts\nof  the  events  are  varied  and  unreliable.  It  is  said that during the fighting, Frederic síl\nBennon  was  thrown  from  his  saddle  and  surrounded  by  orcish forces. Along with his\npersonal  guard,  Frederic  and  Corin managed to fend off multiple attacks before Frederic\nwas gravely wounded and collapsed. In a final act of bravery, Corin is said to have used her\nown body to shield her mentor from further blows before succumbing to her own wounds."

 page_events.1868.d: "\n\n==Death and Resurrection==\nThe  events  following  Corin's  death  are  shrouded  in  mystery,  with  accounts  differing\nbetween  sources.  In  Lothane  Bluetusk's  memoirs,  Corin  is  said to have described her\nexperience  as  a  long  march  through  an  eternal  void, surrounded by ghostly soldiers of\nvarious races. She claimed to have conversed with Nerat, who granted her the power of the\ndisgraced  god  of  war  Agrados  and  tasked  her  with saving Cannor from the Greentide,\nthereby  redeeming the deity as well. Winston Foolfoot, a member of her Circle, recollects\nbeing  compelled  by a mystical force to guard her body, knowing it was not yet her time to\ndie.  All  accounts  concur  that  approximately  three  hours  after  her  death,  Corin  was\nresurrected, her wounds fully healed and her powers as an avatar of Agrados awakened.\n\nAfter  her awakening, her broken armor and tattered gambeson, as well as the attention and\ncare  of  physicians  attempting  to  look  for  injuries,  let her reveal her true gender to her\ncompanions.\n\n==Corin, the Avatar of Agrados==\nThe  squires  and  adventurers  who  were  left behind or separated from the main Marcher\nforces  numbered  in the hundreds and formed the Squire's Alliance, a motley group whose\nkey  members  would  later  form Corin's Circle. With the main Marcher army recovering\nand  the  Greentide  continuing  to  devastate  Escann, they resolved to press on despite the\nslim   chances   of  victory  with  the  original  mission  of  the  Marchers:  to  kill  Korgus\nDookanson. Word began to spread about Corin, the avatar of Agrados, and many started to\nsee  her  as the true leader of the Marchers. These rumors caught the attention of Dominic\nof Gallowspeak, a priest of Nerat who was conducting funerary rites for the Marcher army.\nBelieving  that  Corin's  resurrection  and  transformation into an avatar were the results of\ninfernal powers, he saw it as his duty to kill her and have her soul judged by Nerat in order\nto halt the influence of the Infernal Court.\n\nDomenic  trailed  Corin's  Circle for several days, waiting for an opportunity to strike, and\nfinally  found  an  opportune  time.  He approached her stealthily, his weapon at the ready,\nand  with  a  swift  and decisive blow, he attempted to plunge it into her heart, missing by a\nhair.  To  his  amazement,  Corin's  wounds  began  to heal before his eyes. He watched in\nshock  as  the gash in her chest closed up, leaving no trace of the wound he had inflicted. It\nwas  as  if she had never been injured at all. Dominic realized then that he had been wrong\nabout  Corin. She was no pawn of the Infernal Court. She was something more, something\ntruly  divine.  At  that  moment,  he  became a convinced supporter, devoted to serving and\nspreading the divinity and word of Corin, the Avatar of Agrados and the coming goddess of\nwar.  He  vowed  to  stand  by her side, ready to defend her with his life and to help spread\nher teachings."
 page_events.1869.t: "Corin (person) 3 / 5"
 page_events.1869.d: "\n\nAs  Corin's  party  traveled  through  the  ravaged  Escann,  they  came  upon a sad sight: a\nhalf-orc,  badly  beaten  and  left to die in a crude dirt pit, as punishment by his own tribe.\nHis  name  was  Lothane  Bluetusk,  and  he  had  been  cast  out for daring to support and\nprotect  the  half-orcs of his tribe from being executed, as the only survivor. Determined to\nsave  Lothane,  Winston  Foolfoot,  a  member  of  Corin's  Circle,  proposed  a  plan. He\nsuggested  using  a rope and pulley system to lift Lothane out of the pit. The others agreed,\nand  Winston  set  to  work.  He fashioned a sturdy rope using strips of cloth and vines and\nanchored  it  to  a  nearby  tree. Then, using the pulley, he carefully lowered the rope down\ninto  the  pit.  It  was a slow and exhausting process, but eventually, Lothane emerged from\nthe  pit,  battered  and bruised but alive. Overwhelmed with gratitude, Lothane pledged his\nallegiance  to  Corin and her cause. From that day on, he became a valuable member of the\nCircle,  fighting  alongside  them  and  standing  by  their  side through thick and thin, and\nbecame Corin's closest friend.\n\nIt  is  alleged  that  Corin and Lothane were romantically involved, but there is no concrete\nevidence  to support this outside of later romantic novels and dramatizations. The memoirs\nof Winston Foolfoot support this by mentioning that they both never acted on any feelings.\n\n==Count’s League Coup==\nDuring her travels in southern Escann, Corin encountered Count Carleon Blacktower, who\nwas  conducting  raids against Orcish forces in the area. Impressed by her martial skill and\nconviction,  Carleon  offered  Corin and her companions' sanctuary in the old Castellyrian\nfortress  of  Oldhaven.  Carleon  was  a  member  of  the  Count's  League,  a  coalition of\nsurviving Castellyr nobles and their forces.\n\nAt  Oldhaven,  Corin  presented  her  plan  to  march  on  Castonath  and  call out Korgus\nDookanson  to  end  the  Greentide,  and  Carleon  immediately  pledged  his forces to the\ncause.  However,  the  leading  lords of the Count's League attempted to arrest and execute\nCarleon  and  Lothane  Bluetusk,  prompting  a coup by the younger minor lords, aided by\nCorin.  They  emerged  victorious  and  placed  Carleon  in  charge of the Count's League,\nwhich he committed to supporting Corin's plans in gratitude for her assistance."

 page_events.1870.d: "\n\nCorin  appointed  Lothane  to help Carleon plan, organize his forces, and rally other allies,\nsuch  as  Gryf  the  Young, while she and some of her companions journeyed south into the\nfabled  Deepwoods  in  search  of the mythical fey, hoping to gain their support in the fight\nagainst the Greentide.\n\n==Lifting the Verdant Veil==\nUpon  entering  the Deepwoods and unknowingly crossing the Verdant Veil, Corin and her\ncompanions  were  surprised  to encounter orcs from the Beasteater clan. A confused brawl\nensued,  but  it  was  interrupted  by  a  group of wood elves from Salla Myna. After initial\nmisunderstandings,    Corin    managed   to   befriend   the   wood   elf   ranger   Deinnaril\nSummermoon.  He  told  her about the elven struggles against the orcs and the Conclave at\nElynáile,  a  gathering of all elven clan leaders in an attempt to ally against invading goblins\nand  orcs. Seeing an opportunity to find new allies, Corin convinced Deinnaril to guide her\nto  Elynáile  to  meet  the  elven leaders. However, they were met with mistrust and denied\nentry  into  the  city.  Undeterred,  Corin  and her companions snuck in and interrupted an\nongoing  argument between the clan leaders. Her impassioned speech about the situation in\nEscann  and  the  need to stand together caused chaos and resulted in attempts to arrest her\nand her companions.\n\nThey  were only able to escape thanks to the intervention of the exiled wood elf mage Arun\nDrennen.  Arun  told  them  that  the  Verdant  Veil  could  only  be lifted by defeating the\narchfey known as the Eldest, something no ordinary mortal could do, but that Corin due to\nher  powers  might  be  able to do it. Corin accepted the challenge and set out to defeat the\nEldest  with  Arun  and her companions. Along the way, they discovered the warlock goblin\nOubblig  trailing  them.  Corin  saw the forest goblin's opposition to the Greentide and his\nfey-pact  magic  as  a  good  enough reason to invite him to join their party. They struggled\nthrough the chaotic and ever-changing Feyrealm, engaged the Eldest, now little more than a\nferal  monster,  and  defeated it, lifting the Verdant Veil and opening the Deepwoods to the\noutside  world  for  the first time since the Day of Ashen Skies. Upon returning to Elynáile,\nmany  clans  begrudgingly  allowed their warriors to follow Corin back to Escann, securing\nher  allies  in  the  Deepwoods,  despite  not  being  the ones she sought. On their way out,\nCorin  and her forces encountered a battle between the forest goblin clan Groundhawk and\nsome  orcs.  Seeing  the  goblins  as  potential allies due to their interactions with Oubblig,\nCorin  intervened  and  offered  her assistance in exchange for their help against the orcs of\nEscann.  The  goblins  accepted  and  joined  Corin's  cause,  helping them push out of the\nDeepwoods."

 page_events.1871.d: "\n\n==The Battle of Castonath==\nUpon  reuniting with her Circle, Corin spent the better part of the remaining year securing\nalliances  and  rallying  various  adventurer bands formed from Marcher Lords and Escanni\nsurvivors against the forces of the Greentide.\n\nThe  two  sides  finally  clashed  inside the city of Castonath and slowly pushed through the\ncity,  street  by street. After a week of fierce fighting, Corin and Lothane Bluetusk managed\nto corner Korgus and engage him in single combat. Though Korgus gained the upper hand,\nCorin  stepped  between  him  and the downed Lothane, using her shield to block Korgus's\nstrike.  In  doing  so,  she  left  herself  vulnerable  to  Korgus's  off-hand  weapon and was\nmortally  wounded  beyond  what  her  powers could regenerate. In her final moments, she\nused  the  opportunity  to  strike  with  her longsword, killing Korgus in return. She passed\naway   only   moments  later,  successful  in  defeating  her  enemy  without  sacrificing  the\nwellbeing  of those she cared about. With Korgus's death, the disparate orcish clans had no\nleader to rally around and quickly scattered across Escann, causing the former Greentide to\ncollapse into infighting.\n\n==Corin’s Divine Powers==\nCorin  possessed the divine power of rapid healing, which allowed her wounds to heal at an\naccelerated  rate.  This  made her nearly impervious to injury, as any wounds she sustained\nwould quickly close up, leaving no trace behind.\n\nShe  also  possessed  superhuman  strength,  which allowed her to perform feats of strength\nbeyond  the  capabilities  of  ordinary mortals. This enabled her to wield heavy armor with\nease and to strike with devastating force.\n\nFinally,  Corin was surrounded by an aura of hope, which radiated from her very being and\naffected  those  around  her.  This  aura  had the power to lift the spirits of those who were\nfeeling down and to give them the strength to carry on. Together, these powers made Corin\na  formidable  force  on the battlefield and a beacon of hope for those who fought alongside\nher."

 page_events.280.d: "\nThe  County  of  Bennon  has long been considered the most prestigious hunting ground of\nEsmaria.  Unlike  the forests like the Bardswood, noble hunters would meet and stalk their\nprey  atop  the  slopes  of  Bennonhill  and the Havoral Divide. During these hunting trips,\nexclusive  deals  and  relationships  could  be  made  with  foreign  dignitaries,  built  upon\ncomradery  in  the  hills  rather  than  by  empty  words.  Unlike  their Esmari cousins, the\nBennonians are proud of their serious and responsible nature. During times of war, heavily\narmored  Bennonian  knights  would turn the tide of battle with their fearless bravery when\nlessers  would  flee.  One  of  the  most famous knights of the 15th century, Sir Frederic sil\nBennon was the instructor of Corin before her ascent to godhood. Though his cousin Duke\nAldres  III  sil  Benon  fought  for  the Moon in the Lilac Wars, Sir Frederic fought for the\nRose,  believing that the Damerian Silmuna had betrayed the empire. A veteran of the Lilac\nWars,  he  then  went to Escann to join with the Marcher Lords against The Greentide. He\nmet  his  demise  at  the  Battle of Rottenstep, bravely standing his ground against the orcs.\nBennon  is  home  to  the  gargantuan structure of the grandest High Medieval architecture,\nthe Museum of Virtue is dedicated to the deeds of the past. The halls are filled with armor\nthat  was  worn  by  past  heroes,  statues and monuments bedeck every wall and floor. But\nmost  importantly,  the museum is dedicated to Bennon and its people, a shining beacon of\nits pride.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
 page_events.281.t: "County of Bisan 1 / 2"
 page_events.281.d: "\n==History==\n===Realm of the Lionsword===\nLong  before  the  Day  of  Ashen  Skies,  a  proto-Busilari  tribal chieftain known as Bisan\nconquered  Milcorissian  lands  and  established a strong realm. The swordsmanship of the\nLionsword   was  legendary  and  he  established  a  martial  tradition  which  prevailed  for\nmillennia.  Even  after  the Wexonard migrations, the Bisanese did not forget their heritage\nand the banner of the Lionsword was still used by the County of Bisan.\n\n===Loyal To The Last===\nDuring  the  Dragonwake  in  470  AA, the Damerian Republic granted land for Wexonard\ntribes to settle, in exchange for guarding the Borders against gnolls and other threats. In the\nLilac  Wars,  the Wexonards of Bisan remained loyal to Dameria. This later led to conflict\nwith  their  fellow Wexonards and other neighbours, who changed sides to support the Rose\nparty  instead.  From  Bisanese  perspective,  they  were  fighting  against traitors, but their\nrighteousness  did  not  bring  them  victory.  Countsbridge and Gnollsgate were lost to the\nenemy.  Even  though  Dameria  was  gone,  revanchism  was  high,  and the Bisanese were\ndetermined to strike back and win, no matter the cost.\n\n===Harold IV Gnollcutter===\nThe hills south of Bisan had long been infested with gnolls who had often launched raids to\ncapture   slaves.   In  1403  AA,  Count  Harold  the  Fourth  gathered  the  army  to  seize\nGnollsgate  and  bring  an  end  the gnollish menace. The hill gnolls were beaten in several\ndecisive  battles  and  Gnollsgate was secured under Bisanese rule. Thus Harold IV earned\nthe  title  of  "Gnollcutter",  becoming  one  of  the most famed military leaders of Bisan's\nhistory.  His  bold  tactics  continued  to influence the Bisanese army for many centuries to\ncome.\n\n===The Lansday Massacre===\nMany  Bisanese  were  quick  to  adopt the Corinite faith, as Corin exemplified many traits\nwhich  were  held  in  high  regard  in  Bisan:  Martial  ability,  courage  and willingness to\nsacrifice  oneself  for  a  greater  cause. However, many remained loyal to Adean, and soon\nreligious  tensions  erupted between the two groups like they did elsewhere in Cannor. The\nBisanese solved the problem like how they usually did, with violence. In the night of 7th of\nNerament  1576,  the  eve  of  Lansday, the Corinite faithful struck at the Adeanic nobility.\nThe  outbreak  of  assassinations  and  mob  violence  resulted  in  thousands of deaths and\ncrippled the power of the Adeanics, securing Corinite control of Bisan."

 page_events.1903.d: "\n\n==Geography==\n===The Bisanese Corridor===\nAs  the  Wexhills  were  difficult to navigate, most overland travel between the Borders and\nthe  eastern  Dameshead went across the plains between the Khenak and the Wexhills. This\nvital  trade  route was known as the Bisanese Corridor. Control of this route allowed Bisan\nto collect plentiful tolls from merchants passing through or visiting the nearby free cities of\nMagdalaire and Indlebury.\n\n===Aelthíl Glassweavers===\nAs  the  War  of  the  Sorcerer-King  raged,  Magda  of  Magdalaire,  a Wexonard warlord,\nallowed  elves  to  settle  in  what  later became known as Aelthíl. While many of the elves\nassimilated  into  the  human  populace,  their  descendants  becoming  half-elves,  a  small\nenclave of urban elves remained in the heart of Aelthíl. They were called Glassweavers due\nto  their  skill of using magic to create elaborate items from glass, so beautiful and intricate\nthat  they  were  famed  well  beyond  Bisan  itself. While the Wexonards do show a colder\nreception  to  the  elven  race,  the  Counts  of  Bisan  have  generally  allowed  them  great\nautonomy  and benefits - either due to Bisan's pro-Damerian leanings, or perhaps coin that\nfills their coffers.\n\n===Corpses And Corsets===\nThe  halfling  minority in Corseton became well known for their eponymous corsets. Their\nsmall  hands  were  helpful  with  the  intricacies and allowed corsets to have much smaller\nlacings.  Corsets  were  fashionable  among  noblewomen  and the demand for high-quality\nCorseton  corsets  brought  considerable  wealth  into Bisan. However, there is also a more\nmorbid  origin  to  the city's name. Many know of The Necropolis that dominates the city,\nwhich  was,  for a longest time, the largest temple of Nerat's faith until the Bone Citadel in\nAelantir,  but only historians know that Nerat was not a god of a pre-Elikhet Kheterata, but\nwas  in  fact  an death god imported by Milcorissian slaves. This fact became widely spread\nin  the  16th  century  when  adventurers  uncovered ancient Milcorissian burial grounds in\nCorseton,   containing   corpses   posed  with  corsets,  leading  to  the  curiously  macabre\nrealization that the name for corsets came from corse, an archaic word for corpse."

In 1444, it was part of the\nEmpire of Anbennar.\n\n==History==\n===Lilac Wars===\nCelliande fought on the side of the Silmunas.\n\n===Later Expansionism===\nBecause   the   Counts   of   Celliande   saw  themselves  as  the  rightful  heirs  to  ancient\nMilcorissia,  which  had encompassed much of the Borders, it was not difficult for them to\nfabricate  territorial  claims  on  lands  owned  by  neighbouring  statelets.  As  such,  from\n[PERIOD  START]  to  [PERIOD  END],  Celliande  fought  several  futile  wars  against\n[STATES].  However, despite the high cost of these conflicts [EXAMPLE?], Celliande was\nnot  able  to  subsume  the  entirety of the Borders [DID IT GAIN ANY TERRITORY AT\nALL?]. The period of expansionist policy eventually came to an end with the unification of\nthe Empire of Anbennar.\n\n==Economy==\nSorncell,  the  capital  of  Celliande,  has  been in continuous use as a deepwater port since\nprehistoric  times,  as  large  and  heavy  ships (i.e. merchantmen or warships) could easily\nenter  the  harbour  and  dock  safely.  In  particular,  Sorncell was a key drop-off point for\nBulwari  trade goods, which would be shipped across the Divenhal to be sold in Cannor. It\nwas  preferred to other, larger ports (such as Busilari Port Jaher) due to its position as part\nof  the Empire of Anbennar. Due to this situation, the Counts derived a significant amount\nof revenue from customs duties. It was also a known hub of shipbuilding in the Borders.\n\nDoveswall  was  also  a  major producer of satin fabric, which were manufactured from silk\nimported  from  the  east. These fabrics - which were extremely expensive - were primarily\nused  for  clothing worn by wealthy Celliander noblewomen. However, when Arannen later\nbecame  the  centre  of  textile  production  in  the  Borders,  Doveswall  lost  much  of  its\nrelevance.  The  city  subsequently  improved  their  production  methods  to compete with\nArannen, though it never recaptured its earlier dominance."

It was named after the famous\nCelliander  captain  Serondor  síl  Sorncell. Despite its name, it was a predominantly naval\nforce, and focused on patrolling the coast and curbing piracy.\n\n==[For Later Formatting and Editing]==\nIn  the  16th  century, chroniclers studied the past and the upper class of Celliande learned\nabout the ancient Kingdom of Milcorissia that had once dominated the Borders. While the\nMilcori  people  had  later been devastated by the War of the Sorcerer-King and the White\nPestilence,  the  Arannese  were considered their descendants. The nobles were inspired by\nthese  tales  and  began  fabricating family trees claiming descent from legendary Kings and\nQueens of Milcorissia.\n\nConsidered  by  the  Celliander  upper  class  as  evidence  of  their  Milcori  heritage,  the\nArannese  of Celliande had especially pale skins, and black hair was more common than in\nthe  rest  of  the Borders. Those who lived outside of the Borders saw Celliander women as\nespecially  beautiful  and  elegant.  This stereotype became more widely known in the 18th\ncentury,  when it appeared in Anbennarian poetry and stories. In the 19th century, the term\n"Celliander" was often used for the advertisement of women's beauty products.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

In 1025 the closest surviving member of the\nDerwing  Dynasty,  one  Henric  Derwing,  petitions Ianren the Rider, for the return of his\nfamily's  ancestral  lands.  Ianren  refuses, citing the instability of the region, as well as the\nDerwings'  impoverished  status.  This  led  to a longstanding rivalry between the Derwings\nand Ianren's family."

She  gave  them  all  an education and trained those with magical\naptitude,  a  rare  opportunity for commoners.

 page_events.298.d: "\nVarainé  was  a  county  in  the  region  of Esmaria, part of the Empire of Anbennar, It was\nparticularly well known for its expertise in potioncrafting and skilled alchemists.\n== History ==\n\n=== Early History ===\nWhile  evidence  shows  that  groups of people had lived and visited the area of The Green\nRiver  since  before  the  Day  of Ashen Skies, the first settlements in the area that could be\nconsidered  progenitors  to  Varainé  were estabilished around 474, with the collapse of the\nDamerian  Republic.  These settlements consisted mostly of small villages near The Green\nRiver,  who  worked  early  forms  of  alchemy  and  herbalism,  and  were  subjects  of the\nKingdom of Esmaria.\n\n=== Estabilishment of Varainé ===\nDuring  the  War  of  the  Sorcerer-King,  the  settlements  in  Varainé  received numerous\nrefugees  from  neighboring  Esmari nations, boosting their population drastically. After the\nTreaty   of  Anbenncóst  in  1021,  Esmaria  was  divided  between  the  remaining  Esmari\nkingdom  loyalists  and  warlords  from  the  League  of  Free  Realms.  Varaine  itself was\nfounded  as  a  holding  under  one  of  these  warlords,  Leslinpár. Following this, Varainé\nstarted  to receive Elven migrants from the recently arrived Remnant Fleet due to influence\nfrom their new overlord.\n\nAround  this  period,  due  to  the  refugees and elves, the settlements near the Green River\nbecame  large  enough  to  warrant  the  creation  of  proper administrative holdings for the\nregion,  which  resulted  in  the  creation  of  the  Barony  of  Varainé  and the city of Sorn\n("south" in Elven) Varainé,\n\nEventually,  with Leslinpár becoming a part of the re-unified Kingdom of Esmaria, Varainé\nwould  also  be  once  again  part  of the Kingdom, and after the founding of the Empire of\nAnbennar  in  1121,  the  Grand  Duchy  of  Esmaria.  As Grand Duke XXX consolidated\npower,  The  County  of Varainé was created and split off from the Duchy of Leslinpár as a\nway to regulate Párian power within the Grand Duchy."

This  newfound\nindependence  was  threatened  by  Varainé's  former overlords - Leslinpár- , which pushed\nVarainé  to  aligned  itself  with  the Rose Party and Lorent in the following conflicts of the\nLilac Wars as a means of protecting themselves.\n\nThe  advent  of  The  Greentide  during  the  Fourth  Lilac  War  and  the great increase of\nadventurer  companies  in  response  were a great boon to the Varainé, as potion exports to\nEscanni  adventurers  presented a source of both income and experienced military contacts,\nboth  of  which  were  essential  to  the county during the conflicts against the Moon Party.\nThis  also  had  the  effect  of  making  the  County of Varainé decently wealthy, despite its\nrecent   estabilishment   and  small  size.  This  additional  wealth  helped  grow  Varainé's\nholdings, leading to the merging of the Barony of Varainé and the city of Sorn Varainé into\nthe City of Varainé.\n\nThe  Lilac  Wars resulted in great loss of life for Varainé, but the Victory of the Rose Party\nin 1443 secured the county's independence for the foreseeable future.\n\n=== Age of Unraveling Onwards ===\nAfter  the  development of the Corinite religion, although Varainé did not officially convert\nto  this  new faith, the County was friendly to its worshippers, granting religious freedom to\nits  citizens  and  refusing  to  participate  in  the  Imperial Religious War. This acceptance\nextended  itself  from  the religious to the racial, as Varainé actively incentivized the growth\nof its racial minorities, resulting in the development of significant Gnome, Halfling, Dwarf\nand even Orc communities in the county.\n\nSimultaneously,  alchemists  and  potionmakers grew more and more important in Varainé,\nboth  economically  and  politically, and in 1613 the Academy of Alchemy, Herbalism and\nPotioncraft was officially founded, representing the first major impact alchemists had in the\nlocal  government. This impact would reveal itself again a few decades later, when in 1634\nthe alchemists pushed for the creation of the Alchemical Exploration Corps, and again with\nthe Corps taking over Varainé's diplomacy."

A stretch of the Logrodainé river (itself a\ntributary  of  the  Esmar  River), The Green River presents a distinctive green-yellow color\ndue to the accumulation of sulfur from mineral deposits in and around Mount Havoral.\n\nThis  sulfur,  besides giving the river its color, was also used for the development of several\nVarainéy  industries,  such  as  the  production  of  gunpowder, alchemicals, glassware, and\neventually fertilizers and pharmaceuticals.\n\nThe  Green  River  still  exists to this day, though increased mining activities in the Havoral\nDivide  by  the Dwarves since the 18th Century has reduced the sulfur concentration of the\nriver considerably.\n\n=== Potioncraft, Alchemy, and The Academy ===\nIn  part  due  to  The  Green River, Varainé had long been a gathering place for alchemists\nand  herbalists,  even  before  the  region  was  properly settled. These gatherings remained\nmostly   informal   until  The  Greentide  in  the  15th  Century,  when  potion  exports  to\nadventurers  in  Escann  became  a major source of income for Varainé. In response to this\nincreased   demand,  the  local  government  began  to  actively  encourage  the  activity  of\npotionmakers and alchemists, promoting gatherings and providing infrastructure.\n\nThis  culminated,  in  the  17th  century,  in  the  creation of two of Varainé's most famous\ninstitutions,  which  cemented  the role alchemists played in Varainéy economy, society and\npolitics:   the   Academy  of  Alchemy,  Herbalism  and  Potioncraft,  and  the  Alchemical\nExploration Corps."

Due to\nthe  differences  in  feather  colour  among  each  matriarch,  it has often been described as\nhaving  a  "rainbow-like"  beauty and as such is viewed with opulence among the Siadunan\nHarpies.\n\n==Qualities==\nWhile it is not magical in nature, it is worth noting that it was crafted by dwarves.\n\n==History==\nThe  Origins  of  the  Crest  of  Ishtara  began  with  Ishtara  Ivoryfeather,  who  ruled  the\nSiadanlen  Queendom  at  its height in the early 800s. It was crafted by 12 captive dwarven\nartisans, and upon it's completion, Ishtara plucked one of her own feathers and placed it in\nthe  center of the crown, beginning the tradition of new matriarchs placing one of their own\nfeathers  upon  ascension.  To  Siadunan  Harpies,  the crest is both a symbol of power and\nauthority,  as  well  as  a  symbol  of  respect  and  reverence  towards  previous matriarchs,\nparticularly  those  who  were  known  for  their  ferocity  and  skill  in  war. Following the\nsubjugation  of  the  Siadan  Matriarchy  and  Mulen  Matriarchy  in  1453 by the Elayenna\nMatriarchy,  it  came into the hands of Jasiene Elayenna, who later passed it to down to her\ndaughter  Jaddareesa.  Upon  Jaddareesa's  ascension  to  co-empress  of  the  Jadd Empire\nalongside  her  father  Jaddar,  it  was  incorporated as one of the Crown Jewels of the Jadd\nEmpire.  The  Crest was in Dhenijansar when the Deioderan began, and was utilized as the\ncrown  of  the  Nahana Jadd Empire until it's reunification with the Jaddanzar Empire after\nthe Rending of Realms, when the Crest was returned to Jaddanzar.\n\n"

When used by mages it\ncan  empower  and  prolong  their  spellcasting abilities, and when used in artificery acts as\npower source, ingredient and catalyst to its many inventions and formulae.\n\n==Properties==\n* Absorbs magical energy cast onto it, to a certain point dependant on the quality and size -\ntoo much and it explodes\n* Glows depending on magical energy stored\n* Emits magical energy (radiation), slowly reducing stored energy over time\n* Stored magical energy can be extracted and used to cast spells without the need of a mage\nand power artificery devices\n*\n\n===Effects===\n====On Mages====\nConsumption  or  drawing the energy of nearby damestear amplifies the mages' spellcasting\nability moreso than any other source, even the full moon. The consumption of it also helps\nstave  off magical fatigue, which allows a mage to cast stronger and more spells for a longer\nduration.\n\nHighly addictive to mages, the more potent damestear is the more addictive it is. There are\nsome  cases  where  a  mage  was  tempted with just the sight of the damestear, and tried to\ndrain its magical energies leading to overdose and death.\n"
 page_events.1913.t: "Damestear 2 / 9"
 page_events.1913.d: "\nBlack  damestear,  the  opposite  of  damestear  that  nullifies  magic,  on the other hand is\nrepulsive  to  mages the stronger it is. High concentration of black damestear makes mages\nfeel  queasy  and sickly - and once it enters a mage's bloodstream proper (e.g. via a bullet)\nit can negatively effect or prevent spellcasting entirely for a certain duration.\n\n====On Non-Mages====\nIndividuals  with  no  magical potential or very little magical potential have no problems in\nmining  and  dealing with damestear. Like some other crystals, damestear is toxic, so while\nit is able to be consumed in small doses it is not advised\n\n====On Item Enchantment====\nDamestear   provides  the  magical  energy  needed  to  prolong  the  spell's  effects  on  an\nenchanted  object. While it is not required, it allows objects to be enchanted for incredibly\nlong  periods of time without its effects weakening, as well as allowing stronger spells to be\ncast on the object.\n\nIf  an  enchanted item's damestear is destroyed (e.g. a damestear gem is fractured) then the\nitem's enchantment will begin to decay.\n\nAt  best  it  will  run  out,  and at worst it will have unintended consequences depending on\nhow the spells weaved on an object interact and expire (e.g. an enchanted armour with fire\nresistance  might have been achieved with a reactive ice spell that does the opposite cold to\nany  form of heat - but if its damestear is damaged then that cold might become too strong,\nfreezing the armour onto its wearer)\n\n====On Artificery====\nArtificery  is  simply the continuation of item enchantment but under the guise of scientific\nformulae  and  schematics rather than rituals. The main differences between the two is that\nartificery deals with a lot of moving parts, with many individually enchanted items working\ntogether - whereas traditional enchantment is very singular and specific to the item."
 page_events.1914.t: "Damestear 3 / 9"
 page_events.1914.d: "\n\nWhile  traditional  enchantment  also  uses  damestear  as a power source, it is widely used\nacross  all  of  artificery to cut out the need of an actual mage in the creation and operation\nof such tools and inventions. Runes and etchings on damestear and damestear-alloys is also\nhighly  prevalent  in  artificery  -  and  it  is  common  to see damestear crystals have entire\nequations etched onto them to influence how they work.\n\n==Variants==\n\n===Damestear Meteorite===\nDamestear   meteorites   are   not   made   purely   of   damestear   but   is   similar   to   a\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pallasite          pallasite],          but          consists          of\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stony-iron_meteorite  equal]  parts  damestear  crystals and\nmeteoric  silver,  which  itself  is a rare metal. The components that make up the meteorite\nlooks  to  be  the  origins  of  its relation with the moon goddess The Dame, who's primary\nmetal is silver.\n\n===Damestear Crystals===\nThe  most  popular  form  of  damestear  is  its  crystalline  form, and is usually what most\npeople  refer  to when talking about damestear. These crystals grow bright teal-blue, which\nits  brightness  marking  the  potency  and  how much "magic" is stored within. A shard of\nincredibly  potent  damestear  is  known  to  glow bright white, whereas a damestear that is\ndrained  of  all  magic  is a dull, dark turquoise. Damestear crystals can be "recharged" by\ntransferring magic from a spell to the crystal, though depending on the spell the crystal may\nbreak.\n\nThe  main  usage  of  the  crystals  is  to  absorb  and store magical energy for future use in\nspells,  keep  spells  active  and  artificery.  Larger  crystals  can  store more magic, but the\nclarity of the crystal also influences it (see Pure Damestear).\n"
 page_events.1915.t: "Damestear 4 / 9"
 page_events.1915.d: "\n====Pure Damestear====\nLike  emeralds,  damestear  is  prone  to  inclusion (imperfections inside the crystal) which\naffects  the  efficiency  of  the damestear. Pure damestear are those crystals that are deemed\nhigh enough quality with little to no perfection, just as a diamond would.\n\n===Powderized Damestear===\nDue  to  its  likelihood  of inclusion, damestear is a relatively brittle crystal (as crystals go)\nand  is easily scratched and destroyed - making it a vulnerable part of any weapon or device\nand  likely  to  be targeted. This however makes it easy to crumble into a fine powder. The\nmore potent the damestear is (i.e. the more it glows) the more brittle it is.\n\nThis  is  largely  seen  as an intermediary stage in the process, and powderized damestear is\nthen  mixed  with  other  substances.  It  is,  however,  inhalable,  but is discouraged by the\nMagisterium  due  to its inherent danger in overdose for a mage and damage to the internal\nsystems.\n\n===Liquified Damestear===\nDamestear  is  unable  to  enter liquid state and instead breaks down if higher temperatures\nare  reached.  Liquified  damestear  is  in  instead the powderized form of damestear mixed\nwith  a  liquid  -  usually  water  and  other  liquids  that  help  with damestear's foul taste,\nquickening  digestion  so  that  the  damestear  can  take  its  effect, and preventing internal\ndamage if the powder is not fine enough.\n\nLiquified  damestear  are  usually  referred  to  as  'mana potions' and ingested by mages to\namplify  their  magical  abilities or temporary withold spellcasting fatigue. However unlike\ncrystal  damestear,  the  liquid  damestear  no  longer  glows  as its base state and instead is\nranges  from  blues,  turqouises  and  teals.  Only the strongest of liquid damestear potions\nglow.\n\n===Damestear Alloys==="
 page_events.1916.t: "Damestear 5 / 9"
 page_events.1916.d: "\nWhile  damestear  cannot  be  melted,  their  powderized form can be integrated into other\nmaterials like metals. And while powderization sacrifices damestear's capabilities in storing\nmagical  energy,  it  does  not  lose  its  capability  to  allow  magic  to  conduct through it,\nsimilarly to how copper would conduct electricity.\n\nAs  such  any  sort  of  object  required to work with magic, such as an enchanted sword or\nwiring  for an artificer invention uses some form of damestear alloy. This not only includes\nobjects  comprised  mostly  of  damestear  alloy,  like  the  precursor  spellblades  made  of\nprecursor  steel, but also more commonly objects with damestear ornamentation and lining\nlike  enchanted  armours  to  arcane  copper,  a  damestear-copper  alloy  used in late 19th\ncentury artificery.\n\n===Black Damestear===\nWhere   damestear   stores  and  provides  magic,  black  damestear  takes  and  destroys  -\neffectively  negating magic. To a non-mage black damestear looks like a black crystal, or if\npowderized,   a  shinier  version  of  gunpodwer.  But  to  a  mage  the  strongest  of  black\ndamestear is described as looking into a pitch-black nothingness, a void.\n\n==History & Application==\n\n===Meteorite Origins===\nDamestear  comes  to  Halann in the forms of meteorites which fall from the Astral. While\nthe  meteorites  have  been  recorded  to  fall  at any time or place, there have been a noted\nhigher frequency of damestear showers during the tenth month of the year, the aptly named\nTearfall.\n\nIn  the  mid-18th  century  astrologists  and  astromancers  long-term project spanning two\nhundred  years  officially  discovered  and  identified  the Oracle's Eye Comet as a periodic\ncomet that causes the Tearfall meteor showers to occur.\n"

The most successful of which was by the Magisterium which\nperformedthe  'Skyfall'  ritual  on  the  the  artificial island of Adráil in 1576. The deposit,\nknown  as  the Celestial Damestear, is regarded as one of the largest damestear deposits on\ntheir entire planet.\n\nDamestear  can  also  be  found  underground,  deposited by ancient meteorites such as the\nmine  on  Moonisle.  Such  deposits are incredibly rare, but when they are often they often\nyield  a significant amount of damestear. Most deposits are usually close to the surface, but\nsome have even been found within the Serpentspine Mountains itself.\n\nThe  first  major purveyors of damestear was the Damerian Republic, which discovered the\ndeposit on Moonisle and mined it to sell on to the rest of the ancient world.\n\n===Item Enchantment and Magical Objects===\nFor  much  of  history  damestear  was used as the core component of imbuing objects with\nmagic. While other forms of enchantment do exist, using damestear was the most common\nand easiest way to do so.\n\n===Black Damestear===\nThe Horned Ogres of Haless had long produced a blackened type of Damestear they called\nKorashi.  The  secret  to  creating  this  unique  material is closely guarded by the reclusive\nOni,  and  very  few  samples  had  ever  left  their temples until the rise of the Command.\nExtorting  the  Oni  for  Korashi, the Command was able to manufacture enough to enslave\nmages  for  warfare, aiding their conquests of Haless. It wasn't until 1617 that the Gommo\ngained  access  to  it  thanks  to the Command's failed siege of Tianlou. Using it, artificers\nwere  able  to  create  many  anti-magic  inventions  such  as  black  damestear  cuffs which\nprevent  the  casting  of  magic,  korashi  drills  for  looting the high temples, or projectiles\ncapable of piercing magical shields and wards."

 page_events.1918.d: "\n\nThe  process of turning Damestear into its black counterpart is called "nullification". This\nprocess  refers  to creating a "magical dead-zone", in Haless this was originally done by the\nOni draining the mana stored within the damestear into the Spirit Plane. By channeling the\nmana from the damestear into another plane it creates an anti-mana effect stored within the\ncrystal.  On  a  large  scale  this  process  was thought to be impossible in Cannor until the\nBlackpowder  Rebellion,  when  the  Ravelians,  in league with the rebellious Blackpowder\nBarons,  gained  accessed  the  large  amounts  of confiscated Damestear and nullified large\nsums  of  it, before doing shutting down the Anbennarian damestear industry itself to create\nmore  black  damestear  armaments.  This  caused  the international price of Damestear to\ninflate, which also caused colonial interest in Aelantir to spike to meet market demands.\n\nThey  promptly implemented the black damestear powders into their bulletcrafting process,\ncreating  Black  Damestear-infused  bullets. These projectiles proved the perfect counter to\nmages,   penetrating   any   magical  ward  or  abjurative  protection  casted  against  them.\nPost-Rebellion  scholars  cite  the  mass  production  of  these bullets as one of the primary\nfactors  contributing  to  Blackpowder  Baron  victory  in the war. By the late 19th century\nBlack Damestear-infused bullets became standard across modern armies.\n\nNot  all Black Damestear is the same. The most expensive and pure variants are capable of\ndisabling  spellcasting  abilities  from  hours to days if introduced to a mage's bloodstream.\nThis  particular  disabling  property  revolutionized  warfare  in the 19th century, as mages,\nparticularly  war  wizards,  could  no longer travel the battlefield with impunity as they had\nfor  centuries  before.  By  the  late  Age  of  Artificers, experiments permanently remove a\nmage's  magical  powers  with  an extremely potent brand of Black Damestear saw extreme\nsuccess.\n\n===Artificery===\n\n"

During the Decades of Devastation he declared an open\nrebellion  against  the Kingdom of Birzartanšes becoming the first independent human king\nin  Bahar  since before the Phoenix Empire. He is also known for his unlikely alliance with\nthe Harpylen Matriarchy, and later on for his contested ancestry.\n\n== Early life ==\nBorn  1401  AA,  as  the  son  of  an  aristocrat and landowner from the town of Forramaz,\nDartaxes  had  a  privileged  upbringing,  not  only  due  to  his noble background, but also\nbecause  of  his  father's  connections  to  Keleorn  Liandelzuir,  the  chief  advisor to King\nArantir I.\n\nHe  spent part of his youth studying at the court of Birsartansbar, where he learned the Sun\nElf  language,  as  well as history, diplomacy and military tactics. He later joined the Royal\nArmy on Keleorn's recommendation.\n\n== General of Birzartanšes ==\n\n=== Early Career ===\nDemonstrating  an  aptitude for command and a keen strategic mind, he quickly earned the\ntrust  of  several Sun Elf officers. When the war between Baharkand and Birzartanšes broke\nout in 1419 AA, Dartaxes was appointed general of the northern armies.\n\n=== Battle of Habqez ===\nIn 1422 AA, Dartaxes' army achieved a decisive victory against the Baharkandi army in the\nBattle of Habqez. It was Dartaxes strategic planning and command that is said to have won\nthe  day,  and  his  men  were  instrumental in achieving victory. When the Great Rebellion\nstarted  in  1423  AA,  Dartaxes was ordered to lead his forces to the north of Birzartanšes.\nHe  spent the next years quelling revolts and trying to contain the warlord factions that vied\nfor control of the northern territories."

 page_events.1921.d: "\n\n== The Great Rebellion ==\n\n=== Growing a Following ===\nWhile  fighting  the  warlord  Factions  and  protecting  the local populace, Dartaxes' army\nslowly  grew  with  peasant  volunteers, defectors and reformed bandits. It wasn't long until\nDartaxes  was  considered  the  de  facto  ruler  of  the  northern territories, even though he\nmaintained  he  was  only ruling on behalf of King Arantir I. It was during this time he met\nand  made  an  alliance with The Green Helmets (Šebhulian). The local human population\nand  Green  Helmets  alike  were  tired  of  elven  rulers and inept leadership and wanted a\nhuman  king,  but  it  wasn't  until  1428  AA,  when  Dartaxes  was  invited  to Kuzak, the\nfortress-monastery  of  the  Šebhulian,  that  he  officially rebelled against both Arantir I of\nBirzartanšes  and  Kaltan III of Baharkand. Some sources claim that it was during this time\nhe converted to the Old Sun Cult at the behest of the Green Helmets.\n\n=== Early Rebellion ===\nNeither  Birzartanšes  nor  Baharkand  had  recovered  from the devastating war less than a\ndecade  prior,  and  Dartaxes  knew both kingdoms tactics intimately. Both of these factors\nensured  a  series  of  quick  victories  and  successful  campaigns  early  on in the war. He\nmanaged  to take the upper Našra plain, and established his center of operations in the city\nof  Akal-Uak.  After  failing to take control of the vital port of Deškumar, he retreated and\nprepare  his army to siege both Aqatbar and Birsartansbar, but had to abruptly abandon his\nplans due to the Exodus Goblin invasion in 1435 AA.\n\n=== Becoming King ===\nAfter  suffering  a  defeat  against  the  Marblehead  goblins,  losing  Ur-Monkande  to  the\nGreysheep  goblins  and Habqez to Birzartanšes, Dartaxes and Arantir I negotiated peace in\n1436  AA,  officially  recognizing  Dartaxes  as  Akal,  making  him  the  first  independent\nHuman king in Bahar since the Jaherian Conquests centuries prior.\n"

Dartaxes conversion to the Old Sun Cult had\nalso  managed  to  rally  the  clergy of the New Sun Cult against him. Dartaxes had in turn\nswelled  the  ranks  of  the  now  elite Green Helmets, and in 1445 AA a group of Masnsih\nmagi arrived at Akal-Uak to join him.\n\n=== Battles of the Našra Plain ===\nThe brunt of the war took place on the Našra Plain. After several small skirmishes, the two\nmain  armies  clashed  on  the  outskirts  of Dartaxes capital of Akal-Uak. The battle was a\nnear  standstill  between  the  two forces for almost two days.

Keladora  I  sent  her  army in pursuit, and laid siege to the fortress. Dartaxes had\nmanaged  to  negotiate  an alliance with the Harpylen Matriarchy, who were embroiled in a\nwar  of their own against the Birzartanšesi vassal of Gelkalis. By allying with Dartaxes, and\nmaking  sure the fortress of Kuzak was well supplied, they prevented the main Birzartanšesi\narmy  from  supporting  their  vassal.  The  siege would last for three years, and was finally\ncalled off with a peace treaty in 1454 AA.\n\n== Death ==\n\n=== Second Siege of Kuzak ===\nIn  the  decades  following  the war, Dartaxes focused his effort soley inwards, in stabilizing\nand  improving  his  realm. His alliance with the Harpylen Matriarchy allowed him respite\nfrom  the  threat  of  Keladora  I  and  Birzartanšes. He continued to rule from Kuzak until\n1484  AA,  when  Keladora  I  launched another campaign to retake her former lands. The\nsecond  siege  of  Kuzak  was  successful,  and  the  Birzartanšesi forces managed to capture\nDartaxes.

 page_events.332.d: "\nThe  Day  of  Ashen  Skies  (also  known  as  The  Ruin  of  Aelantir  to  the  elves)  was  a\ncataclysmic  world event in the Year 1 which saw the destruction and shattering of the elven\ncontinent  of  Aelantir,  the  destruction  of  the  Precursor Empire and the expulsion of the\nelven survivors to wander the seas, in addition to the general rise of magic in the world. By\nthe  late  17th century most scholars agreed that the Day of Ashen Skies was the final act in\nwhat was a centuries-long series of civil war across the Aelantir known as the War of Two.\n\n==Stages==\nThe  literary  figure  Sammard  Ionden was the first to separate the Ruin into sequences for\nease  of  understanding,  but  note  that  there was great overlap between some of the stages\nlisted below:\n\n===Stage 1: Fall of Aesadas===\nAt  the  end  of  the  War of Two the leader of the opposition, Ducaniel, was imprisoned in\nthe  flying  city  of Aesadas, the capital of the Precursor Empire. During his time in prison,\nDucaniel  began  a  dark  ritual  to incur his wrath against all those who wronged him for it\nwas said that if he were not to rule Aelantir, no-one would. The first step with this, as with\nmost  dark  magic, is sacrifice, so he instructed his followers to infiltrate the flying city and\ncause it to crash to provide such energy, killing millions on impact.\n\n===Stage 2: Ducaniel's Wrath===\nAs  the  city  crashed into the earth the ritual was fed the souls of the fallen and emitted the\nrealm-shattering  blast  that  would  be  known  today  as  Ducaniel's  Wrath.  The magical\nexplosion  first  blasted  in  a  spherical  radius  obliterating  all  land  and  those within it,\ncreating  what  is  known today as the Ruined Sea, in addition to forging the Cliffs of Ruin.\nAfter  that,  it  is  theorized  that the explosion reverted into itself and imploded to create a\nmuch  larger  shockwave  that  affected  the  rest  of  the continent, and also led to the next\nstage.\n\n===Stage 3: Rending Earth==="
 page_events.1924.t: "Day of Ashen Skies 2 / 4"
 page_events.1924.d: "\nIt  is  believed  that  the  underlying continental plates were split apart in the blast, pushing\nthem in an outward radius. This was the main event in The Ruin and destroyed many cities\nin continent-wide earthquakes, floods, and other natural disasters.\n\nIt  is  in  this  stage that the Day of Ashen Skies could be seen and felt across the rest of the\nworld.\n\n===Stage 4: Rending Spirits===\nNot  much is known about this stage, and much is a hypothesis by modern scholars. While\ntearing  apart  Aelantir,  the  blast  also  tore  the  fabrics  of reality, opening up gateways to\nparallel  and  'corrupted'  versions of our world. Most notable is the Shadow Plane and the\nFeyrealm,  which  lie  on  the  opposite  sides  of  life  and  death  -  some scholars such as\nRothomar the Wise suggests that some surviving precursors were thrown into these parallel\nplanes and corrupted into the planar creatures we see today.\n\n===Stage 5: Corruption===\nCombined  with  the  excess  of raw magical energy and the geographical destruction of the\ncontinent,  Aelantir  began to morph and change, climates changed drastically, fauna turned\nvolatile, and the precursors that remained have degenerated into the creatures we see today.\n\nDuring the Age of Unraveling, the explorers of Cannor found Aelantir a inhospitable place,\nthough  still possible for development and bountiful harvest. In the time between The Ruin\nand the Unraveling, scholars suggest that the magical corruption had faded to a manageable\nlevel, even enough to provide new crops, metals, and other resources.\n\n==Effects of the Day of Ashen Skies==\n*The general rise of magic in the world, allowing arcane magic to be harnessed for the first\ntime as a tool.\n*The  Century  of  Ash:  Volcanoes  across Halcann erupted, and their ash, combined with\nthat of the Ruin of Aelantir, did not fully dissipate until 100 AA."

It led to the collapse of two of the three elven states in the\nregion,  with  Re'uyel  being taken over by human rebels and Baharkand being reduced to a\nrump  state centered on Eduz-Wez. Among the conflicts which took place during the period\nwas the Baharkandi-Birsartanšesi War.\n\nWhile historians disagree on when the Decades of Devastation began and ended, a plurality\nconsider  it to have begun in 1418 with the Re'uyeli Succession War. A minority considers\nit  to  have begun in 1413 with the Years of Dryness, while others consider it to have begun\nwith  the human uprisings or the Goblin Exodus. The Decades of Devastation are generally\nconsidered  to  have  ended  in  1454  with  the signing of the Peace of [PLACEHOLDER]\nbetween the Bahari republics and the goblin clan of Marblehead.\n\n== Years of Dryness (1413-1418)==\nWhilst they are not always seen as part of the Decades of Devastation the years of recurring\ndryness  and  crop failures did their part in weakening the region in its upcoming struggles.\nThey  led  to  farmers becoming bankrupt and strengthening the power of the nobility. This\nalso  reduced  tax  income  while  at  the  same  time,  kings were forced to buy grain from\nabroad to prevent food riots. In neglected regions lots of peasants and people dependent on\nthem  were  forced  into crime to feed their families. Incompetent responses also decreased\ntrust in the elven monarchs.\n\n== The Dynastic Wars (1418 - 1423) ==\n\n===The Re'uyeli Succession War (1418)===\nIt  all  started when king Kalinael of Re'uyel died in a carriage accident. Then according to\nthe  Sun  Elf system of tanistry, the countries most powerful nobles convened to elect a new\nking  out of Kalinael's dynasty. Normally such affairs were peacefully settled (or at least in\nRe'uyel).  But,  not  only  had  his  brother  and  most  obvious  candidate  also died in the\naccident, king Kalinael had also lived by 'divide and rule' and had encouraged factionalism\nand  infighting  amongst  the  nobility,  who now were at each others throats. Then the race\nbegan  between  his  half-brother  (a  bastard  son  of  his  father)  and his cousin. Another\ncandidate  was  Seluzia,  a  half-sister of Kalinael and queen of Baharkand by marriage, she\nwas  generously  supplied  with  bribes  by  her  husband  who saw this as an opportunity to\nplace  Re'uyel  firmly in his sphere of influence. The half-brother ended up winning with a\nslight  plurality  (it  is  unknown  whether  it was because he was more popular or better at\ncheating),  but  as  he  practically  promised  to  favour  one of the noble cliques, the other\nclique  claimed  he  was an illegitimate candidate being a bastard (they also accused him of\nvote-rigging) and rose up to support his cousins claim to the throne starting a civil war."

Already divided and weakening by\ninfighting  the  Re'uyeli  armies  were  brushed aside by the military of Baharkand, on their\nroad   the   invading   army   found   a  fort  build  upon  the  ruins  of  the  mighty  citadel\nAzka-szel-Azka,  designed  to withstand a siege for months the fort nonetheless fell within a\nmere  week  due  to  treason.  (an  adjutant  of  its  commander  was  a childhood friend of\nSeluzia,  who  was  secretly  contacted  by  her  and  promised a promotion in exchange for\nsabotaging the forts defences.)\n\nThen  when  king  Kaltan  was  nearing  the city of Re'uyel, he received terrible news: king\nArantir  of  Birsartanšes  had  declared  war  on him, claiming to reunify the legacy of their\nancestor  Amarien. By the time he had received the news, the vanguard of the Birsartanšesi\narmy  had  already  set  foot  in  his  homeland. He hunted down as quickly as possible the\nother  contenders  and  installed  his  wife  in  Re'uyel,  so  he  could  leave  to  defend  his\nhomeland, within the season.\n\n===The Re'uyeli Revolution (1419-1420)===\nDespite  most  of  the Baharkandi military, including nearly all its mages, returning to their\ncountry, Seluzia's hold on her birth country initially appeared mostly secure, as most of the\ncountries  high  nobility  was  either defeated on the battlefield, appeased with various titles\nand  promises  or  cowed  into submission. However, this neglected the lower nobility: the\nfailure  of  the  former  government  to  properly  respond  to  the  famines  left the human\ncommon  folk  with a lot of resentment, whilst the lower nobility (who felt sidelined by the\nnew Baharkandi advisors) was disgruntled with its lack of power and feared that Baharkand\nwould  treat  their  country as simply a source of income. Those two classes made common\ncause and joined together in a 'monster alliance' against Seluzia.\n"

In the beginning the regime assumed that it was\nbut  a  loosely  organized  rebellion  of  'peasants  and  plebeians',  whilst they were mostly\ncorrect in the latter, they were wrong in the first as the few veteran-officers and nobles who\njoined  the  rebellion  were  sufficient  to  turn  it  into more then a mere mob. Using their\nknowledge  of the local terrain and their enemies underestimation of them, the rebel forces\nmanaged  to  lure  the  Baharkandi  forces  into  a  guerilla  war in the cities, negating their\nadvantages  in cavalry and archery. As word of this defeat spread, more uprisings broke out\nin  the  rest of the country (though most of them were but excuses to seize land from elvish\nlandlords) and the lower nobility threw its entire weight behind the rebellion.\n\nEventually  the  capital  was  found  abandoned by the Queen. Seluzia and the garrison had\nalready  given  up  holding  into the place and had evacuated themselves with sky platforms\n(chariot-like flying vehicles piloted by a mage).\n\nThen  in  a  boat  of anti-monarchism and taking example on the various Bulwari republics\nthat  existed,  a  republic  was  proclaimed.

At  the start this invasion the Baharkandi forces were making great gains\nbut they outran their supply lines and ended up routed at the battle of Habqez in 1422."

First they countered this\nby  drafting  every  human  commoner  into  their armies and then they made deal with the\nbandit  groups  that plagued the area. It turned out to be a mistake, because it strenghtened\nthe   bandit   bands,  some  having  become  officers  in  their  own  right  and  the  human\npopulation  at  large  decided  that  if  they  had  to  fight  they  might  just as well fight for\nthemselves, instead of their overlords, and revolted.\n\nThe  two  elven  kingdoms  were  then  forced  to  make  peace  in  order  to  focus  on the\nrebellions.\n\n== The Great Rebellion (1423-1436) ==\nThe  Great  Rebellion  was  the  name given by elven scholars to the general uprising of the\nBahari  populations  against  their  rule  and which forced the two Amarienzuir branches to\ncome to an unlikely alliance.\n\nThe  bandit groups that had become mercenaries began to carve fiefs in the region, creating\na new feudal order with them at the top ; meanwhile, several peasant communes massacred\nthe  nobles who had taxed them in the name of the elven Kings who had been badly advised\nin their palaces. Even more dangerous was the threat of Old Sun Cultists, who had steadily\nbeen  amassing  power  in  the  Harpy Hills and felt confident enough to show their faith in\nthe  open.  As  the  elves  were  a much larger presence in East Bahar then in Re'uyel, they\nmanaged  to  stem the early tide and suppressed uprisings in their capitals and on the coast.\nBut  actually  reconquering the outlying rebel territories proved a more difficult task, as the\nrebels  bands quickly organized themselves and were joined by disillusioned ex-officers and\nnobles.\n\nThe  early  Great Rebellion, usually understood to begin with the peace between Kaltan III\nand Arantir in 1423 until the alliance between Dartaxes szal Forramaz and the leader of the\nGreen  Helmets  in  1428.  During these 5 years, chaos reigned in Bahar as several leaders\nrose  and  failed,  while  both  Kaltan  and  Arantir were forced into a difficult guerilla war\nagainst  various  rebel  groups.  The  biggest  threat  was  the rebellion of Dartaxes, former\ngeneral  of  Arantir  and arguably the mind behind the victory at Habqez in 1422. Contrary\nto  many  other  rebels he set out to right wrongs in the provinces he held under his control\nand  always  claimed  to  still  be  a  vassal  of  Birsartanses,  while  in practice ruling as an\nindependent  ruler.  Under  his rule, every bandit that refused to join his army was hanged,\nand  peasants  could  take  back  lands  from  any  landowner  who  opposed Dartaxes. The\ngeneral  thus  began  to get the support of the masses and the various powers in the area. In\n1428,  he  met  Harum  szal-Harumanz,  commander  of  the Kuzak fortress and the Green\nHelmets  sect.  While  no  one knows the exact terms of the meeting, Dartaxes proclaimed\nhimself Akal and claimed the old realm of Baharšes."
 page_events.1930.t: "Decades of Devastation 5 / 10"
 page_events.1930.d: "\n\nBy  1428,  the  Great Rebellion had become the Dartaxâgerdim rebellion and from his seat\nin Akal-Uak, Dartaxes set out in a campaign against both elven realms which was generally\nsuccessful  although  the alliance with the Green Helmets had rallied the clergy of the Cult\nagainst  the  rebellion.  It  is  to  be noted that at this point, Dartaxes had not yet converted\nofficially   even   though  the  Old  Sun  sects  histories  claim  the  contrary.  Nonetheless,\npreparations  for  the  sieges  of  Birsartansbar  and Aqatbar were well on their way in 1435\nwhen  the  Greesheep  goblins  poured  out  of  the  Dwarovar, diverting the army who was\nadvancing  in the South. In Baharkand, the Dartaxian army also met with defeat in Nisabat\nagainst  the  Marblehead  goblins  who  then  went  on  to  conquer  Aqatbar.  Pressed with\nenemies  on  all  fronts,  Arantir  having retaken the town of Habqez, Dartaxes made peace\nwith  Arantir  I,  securing  his  holdings  for the time being as the first independent Human\nking in Bahar since the Jaherian conquest.\n\n==The Crathanori secession war (1427-1430)==\nWestern  Bahar  was  not  pacified  either.  There  had  already  been  tensions between the\ntrading cities in the province of Crathanor and the new republican regime in Re'uyel which\nstemmed   from   both   political   (the   noble-poor   western   regions   found   they  were\nunderrepresented   in  the  government)  and  cultural  reasons  (in  the  west  most  of  the\npopulation  weren't  Baharis but descendants of colonists from Busilar and Eborthil, settled\nthere  by  Jexis  and  her  successors  to  repopulate  a devastated region). So when the new\nregime  proceeded to place most of the tax burden on them, this was poorly received by the\nwestern  merchant  elite  who  started  agitating  for  independence.  The  situation held for\nnearly  a  decade  when  the  new  republic  received  an  ultimatum from the Crathanorian\ncities.  Under  the  slogan  of  'no  representation  without  taxation' they demanded that in\nexchange  for  the  privilege  of controlling the government the nobles should pay their 'fair\nshare'  of  the  tax  rise.  After  this  was  coldly  rejected  the  western  provinces  declared\nindependence.\n\nThe  first  part  of  the  secession  war turned out to be a rather anti-climatic conflict as the\nCrathanori  were  neither  numerous  or  militarized,  whilst  their Bahari counterparts had\nbarely  started  with  rebuilding  the  army.  The secessionist lacked the strength to kick the\neasterners  out  of  their  country  and  the Re'uyeli had not enough soldiers (which weren't\npeasants  who cared more about their hometown then the idea of an united Re'uyel) to start\nsieging  the  rebelling  cities.  In  the second year of the war, the Crathanori were joined by\nthe  dwarves  from  Ovdal  Tungr,  who  still bore a grudge to their old enemies of Re'uyel,\nwho  had  built  their strenght and wealth on Ovdal-Tungr's back. Just when victory looked\nimminent,  the  news  of  two  hordes  of  goblins  coming from Ourdia arrived, forcing all\nparties  to  divert  all their attention into defending against the goblins. The effectiveness of\nthis defense was debatable as all three countries lost some territory."

(Whilst the Dookanson\ndidn't articulate the reasons for this invasion more clear then "TO TURN ALL GOBLINS\nINTO  OUR  GRUNTS",  it  is  generally  assumed  he  did so to secure his flanks before\ngoing west, to harden his troops and of course to capture slaves.)\n\nAs  Korgus  led  his  armies  to  siege Khugdihr his hold over southern territories lessened,\nallowing some goblins to free themselves and flee west, away from the orcs.\n\nThe  Exodus horde split due to internal conflicts over leadership in various groups, first the\nwestern  and  southern  tribes.  Southern  group  took  a  slower path through the caves and\neventually  split  again  - into a tribe of Thieving Arrow, who chose to stay in Dwarovar and\nanother group, who chose to keep going towards the surface.\n\nThe  western group followed the Dwarovrod towards the surface, splitting too into southern\nand  western  groups. The southern group reached the surface earliest through Shazstundihr\nand  took  up  the  name  Marblehead. The western group exited later through Orlghelovar\nand descended upon Ourdia.\n\nThe  war with Ourdia was mostly unsuccessful, with goblins failing to take the Castanorian\nfortress  and  being  attacked  from  the  east  by  a forest goblin tribe of Oubligschild. The\ngroup  was  forced to separate, with the ones going by sea calling themselves Landshark and\nthe  one going along mountain passes calling itself Mountainhugger. The two groups joined\ntogether  and  attacked  the  warring  Bahari  states of Reuyel, Crathanor and Ovdal-Tungr,\ndisplacing  and  killing  humans,  elves  and  dwarves  alike  from the lands they took. The\ninvasion  caused  the  three  Bahari  states  to  make  peace  and  focus on fighting back the\ngoblins."

Securing  hilly regions of the northern Bulwar\nthe  goblins adopted a somewhat pastoral living, raiding and kidnapping a number of sheep\nfrom nearby Gelkalis people.\n\nDespite  the  exodus  goblin numbers being severely depleted during the early Bulwari wars\nthe  Exodus  was  considered victorious, with 4 goblin states emerging in Bahar. Moreover,\nmore  goblins kept coming from the Serpentspine, especially following the death of Korgus\nand the collapse of his empire.\n\n===The Fall of Aqatbar (1439)===\nMarble  Head  had raided and pillaged nearby Bahari lands, fighting numerous bandits and\nsmall human mercenary bands after they had come out from Shaztunsdhir. Eventually, they\nencountered  Green  Helmets  who were advancing onto Aqatbar but managed to beat them\nand decided to go on the offensive towards the south and the fledging Baharkandi kingdom.\nThe  tribe  was  led  by the goblin Idrarseff, who believed the only way to secure a place for\ngoblins in Bahar is by breaking elven authority and human spirit. While he was leading the\narmies,  his  brother  Perzuk  was  left  to  deal  with  the conquered lands. Perzuk became\ninterested  in  local  human  customs  and  traditions  and believed that goblins could learn\nfrom them.\n\nMeanwhile,  Idrarseff sieged and led the assault on the fortress of Aqatbar, conquering it in\n1439.  Following  the  city  seizure,  Goblins  captured  the  Eletarzuir family and executed\nKaltan  III,  his  wife  Selusia  and  their  heirs  Elriandor  and Amarien.

Unfortunately,  his armies were at their limit and the idea of reconquering\nAqatbar  was  left  for  later.  Irran  was  seen  as  a hero both by elves and humans alike in\nBaharkand  especially after he decided to contact Deggarion of Azka-Evran and swear fealty\nto him. Irran’s loyalty was rewarded and he keeps ruling over coastal Baharkand in 1444.\n\n== The Last Decade of Devastation (1444-1454) ==\n\n\n=== The Našra Reclamation War (1448-1454) ===\nThe peace of 1436 was seen by both Dartaxes and the new queen of Birsartanseš, Keladora\nI,  as  a  ceasefire  with  both  camps preparing for the next war. Following her couping her\nfather  Arantir,  Keladora  engaged  on  a  series of reforms aimed at removing corrupt and\ninept  officers  and  statesmen.  These were successful, with a younger blood rising through\nthe  ranks  and  the  Royal  Army changing its traditional tactics whom Dartaxes knew. She\ncould  also  count  on  a  special  detachment  of Jaherian Examplars, who had grown more\nnumerous  in  the  area following the official conversion of Dartaxes to the Old Sun sect of\nthe  Green  Helmets. Meanwhile, Dartaxes could also count on his Sebhuliam elite forces,\nwhich  were  rumored  to  fight  to  the death and whose ranks had been steadily increasing\nalong  with  a  renewed  magi  force,  led  by the young Kisar szal-Faszil, from the Mašnish\ntribe of the same name.. In 1448, both felt confident enough to break down diplomacy and\nrenew war\n\nThe fights all occured along the Našra plain, where both had their capitals. The advance of\nthe  Birsartanšesi  army was met with several undecided skirmishes until they arrived at the\ncapital  of  the  rebel  akalate,  Akal-Uak.  There  the Green and Pink banners fought for 2\ndays.  Flying  platforms  were  struck down by the the Human magi, while the elven cavalry\ncould  not  manage  to  pierce  the  Green Helmets formation. Eventually, the Birsartanšesi\nforces  slowly but surely took the upper hand, and the victory was secured by the treason of\nTalimaz szel-Forramaz, the nephew of Dartaxes. His forces hailed the Pink Phoenix banner\nand  in  the  confusion  struck  down  Kisar,  leading to a complete rout as the elven mages\ncould  fire  at will. The Sebhuliam, true to their faith, never surrendered and were killed to\nthe  last  man.

For 3 years, the siege\nendured,  thanks  notably  to  an  unexpected  alliance  with the Harpy Queendom who was\nattacking  the  Birsartanšesi  vassal of Gelkalis, and provided the fortress valuable supplies.\nThe spent Birsartanšesi forces were ordered to leave the mountains in 1454 following news\nfrom  the  fall  of  Deggarion.  While  no  peace  treaty  was  concluded,  after  1454, both\nDartaxes and Keladora stopped hostilities and focused on their realms.\n\n=== The fall of Deggarion (1449-1453) ===\nAfter  the  fall  of  Aqatbar,  the  bastard  son  of  Kaltan  III,  Deggarion  had gathered the\nremaining  forces  of  the  Kingdom  in  the  fortress  of  Azka  Evran.  Profiting  from  the\ninstability  in  Marblehead  and the Našra war, he struck against the Goblins of Greysheep,\nsecuring his Eastern border. After hearing of the divisions between the two Goblin brothers\nof  Aqatbar,  Idrarseff  and  Perzuk,  and  the  civil  war  that  it  had  provoked, Deggarion\nmarched  towards  Aqatbar.  To his surprise, his spies had not heard of the coup of Perzuk,\nwhich  had  reunified  the  forces  of  the  clan  and  increased  his  own forces with human\nauxiliaries  :  Deggarion  arrived  at  Aqatbar to see a weak and exhausted goblin force ; he\nmet  with  a  large mixed army which confused its own troops and left him no possibility of\nretreat.  Chronicles  tell  of the bravery of Deggarion and his men, but in the end it did not\nmatter for his army was slaughtered and his realm annexed by the Marblehead goblins.\n\n=== The Proclamation of Aqatbar and the League of Four (1450-1454) ===\nThe  goblin  invasion  left  west  Bahar  in  an  unstable  disposition.  While  the republics\nmanaged  to stop the goblin momentum, none could afford to push them further. The three\nsides  (Crathanor  and  Ovdal  Tûngr,  Re’uyel,  and  the  goblin clans) knew that starting a\nlarge-scale   offensive  against  one  side  would  leave  them  vulnerable  to  attack  by  the\nremaining one, creating a deadlock. The resolution came in late 1450 with the outbreak of\nthe  civil  war in Marblehead. Emboldened by the fact the most powerful of the goblin clan\nwould not be able to intervene, the three republics officially broke peace between them and\nstarted   to  prepare  a  joint  attack  on  the  Mountainhugger  and  Landshark  clans.  The\npreparations  were slow however, hindered by the lingering animosities of the past decades.\nThe  offensive  was  finally  launched in the spring of 1452, just one day before Deggarion’s\nfall  at  Aqatbar.  Despite  an  initial  success at Akrad-Til, the unfortunate timing gave the\ngoblin  clan  bosses  an  opportunity to flee to the now more stable Marblehead, in hope of\nconvincing Perzuk to help them."

 page_events.1935.d: "\n\nThis  marked  the  first  time  all  the  clan  bosses  would meet in the same place since the\ngoblin  exodus  started.  Never  the  type  to  let  such an opportunity pass, Perzuk used his\ncraftiness  and  position of strength to trigger the events of the Proclamation of Aqatbar and\nthe  unification of the clans under Marblehead. Pledging to become the protector of all the\ngoblins  of  Bahar,  he  marched his troops west to rescue what was left of Mountainhugger\nand  Landshark.  The  quickness of the intervention surprised the republican armies, which\nsaw  them  badly  defeated  at  the  battle of Kaproya and forced to retreat to the fortress of\nAzka-szel-Azka.  However,  once  behind  the  great  walls  of  the  ancient  stronghold and\nreinforced  by  Ourdi  troops,  the  bahari  were able to hold multiple assaults with relative\nease.  As  a  prolonged siege became the only possible course of action to make the fortress\nfall,  Perzuk  realised  that  he  wouldn’t have the quick war he hoped for, despite his vastly\nsuperior  numbers.  With the flames of the civil war barely extinguished and suffering from\na naval blockade by the republics, the clan boss decided to not prolong the war and opened\npeace  talks  with  his exhausted opponents. The goblins would keep control over the lands\npreviously  held  by  the  Mountainhugger  clan, Ourdia and Crathanor would keep control\nover  the  land previously held by the Landsharks, and all goblins were allowed safe passage\nthrough  west Bahar until they reached Marblehead. Perzuk considered his pledge fulfilled,\nwhile the Bahari states officialised their alliance into the Naqtazka (or league of Azka).\n\n== Resolution and Consequences ==\n\nThis is generally taken as the endpoint of the Decades of Devastation, as Eastern Bahar was\nconsolidated  under the realms of Marblehead and Birsartanses, which were both exhausted\nby  wars and unwilling to fight each other. In a controversial decision, Keladora abandoned\nher  claim  to  the  kingdom  of  Baharkand  in  exchange  for peace and the promise of the\ngoblins  to let her army pass into Gelkalis. While the Gelkari expedition (1456-1458) was\nan  utter  disaster,  with  barely  a hundred soldiers coming back from the Harpy Hills, the\nCeldaro-Perzuk  accord  allowed  peace to flourish in Eastern Bahar. Dartaxâgerdim would\nendure   in   the  mountains  of  Kuzak,  thanks  to  its  unlikely  alliance  with  the  Harpy\nQueendom.  The  siege of Kuzak in 1484 ended the kingdom but they were seen by now as\na  mere  nuisance  and  not a true threat by that time. Meanwhile, the precarious Naqtazka\nmanaged  to hold their ground, until the later formation of the Overclan and the Betrayal of\nRe’uyel."

This included many wars, the spread of Ravelianism\nto  the  Ynnic  Ruinborn  people  as well as the spread of cannorian ideas in their lands, all\nunder the rule of King Jahanon síl Lethir and his descendants.\n\n==Rise of High Havoral==\nNew   Havoral   always   had  poor  relations  with  their  neighbors  due  to  its  history  of\nharbouring  bandits.  New  Havorics especially resented the Empire of Arverynn ever since\ntheir  intervention  in  the Ivory Wars in 1724 AA, and had been forced into an isolationist\nstance by force of circumstances.\n\nThis  would  change  in  1788  as  their  ruler at the time, Jahanon síl Lethir, was a man of\nambition  and  the  Red Year gave him the opportunity to act despite the Bandit Kingdom's\ndiplomatic isolation.\n\nImmediately  after  Corinsfield had conquered much of Arverynn's eastern territories, New\nHavoral  declared war against them under the pretense of restoring West Tipney’s lands the\nCorinites   had   also  annexed.

West Tipney was made\ninto  an  autonomous region, and Ynnic lords were reinstalled as vassals of the Kingdom in\nthe  lands  conquered  during  the Red Year under the agreement of collaboration with their\nnew  overlord.

From  1790  through  1795,  King Jahanon began a\nprocess of consolidation of his rule.

The  lords  of  Trompolere  and  the  city  of  Vels Domfan were his main supporters\namong the conquered due to respect for his ambition and the Cannorization he introduced,\nrespectively.\n\nJahanon's   rule  was  controversial  even  among  his  Cannorian  subjects.  Most  notably,\nCorinsfielders staunchly opposed him, and even some among his own people: humans who\nstayed  in  New  Havoral  felt  abandoned  as  they  had  become  a  minority  in  their own\nkingdom, now ruled from a former Sarda town.\n\nThe  High  Havorics  planned  to  introduce  an  ancient  dwarven  invention on Balgabar's\nsolicitation:  a  railway  connecting  Arverynn  to Greyguard through Veykoda. The project\nwas  left  half-built  due  to  protests  by  Ynnic nobility, issues with early rail technologies,\nraids  by  Veykodans  along the construction sites and an eventual falling-out with Balgabar\ndwarves."

After  the  Red  Night  of\nAdbrabohvi  and  the  sudden  fall  of  the  Empire,  the  faith was at its weakest. The most\ndevout  priests  opposed  High  Havoral, but others made the opposite choice, converted to\nRavelianism  and  became  Rectors;  some  to  get  the favor of the new administration, but\nmany out of genuine belief. The Rectorate never recognized High Havoral rectors however,\ndespite Jahanon's insistence.\n\n===Worsening Isolation===\nHigh  Havoral  was  widely disliked by Ynnic as well as Cannorian states in the Ynn. Their\nfellow  Ravelians  in Plumstead saw High Havoral as a backwards authoritarian state, and a\ncommon   declaration   from  many  western  rulers  denounced  Jahanon  as  a  “villainous\nCannorian usurper”. Even their Balgabar allies were eventually driven away by their greed.\n\nThe  former  vassal  of  Ynnsmouth  embargoed  High Havoral in 1790, cutting them from\ntheir  main  trade  route  with  the Trollsbay and the world. The embargo was responded to\nwith  the  building  of  the  Arbeloch Ascensor in order to link eastern Veykoda to the Sella\nRiver  which  flows  into  the New Redglades. While this construction did not dislodge the\nrole  of Ynnsmouth as the main port towards the Ynn, it opened up an alternative avenue to\ntrade through the Yanekin and Sella rivers.\n\nNot  many  were  willing  to  have  ties  with  High Havoral, and those who did were either\nisolated  themselves  or  had a very flexible diplomacy, such as Bosancovac, the kingdom of\nthe Freemarches or Brelar.\n\n==War of Ynnic Unification==\nAt   the  peak  of  High  Havoral's  power,  Jahanon  felt  ready  to  challenge  the  Dragon\nDominion  for  hegemony  over  the  Ynn,  hoping to finally claim the title of emperor and\nunite  the  valley.  The  situation  quickly escalated as a coalition was formed to contain his\nhegemonic ambition and most other states sided with the Dominion. This marked the start\nof the War of Ynnic Unification."

This republican\nuprising  was  joined  by  Pipefoot  halflings. To the north, Balgabar seized Corinsfield and\nkept out of the conflict.\n\nThe  New  Havoric  uprising  was  seen  as  the main threat, and Brayden ignored Dharo to\nretake  his  old  homeland.  While the High Havoric king focused on the east, Sarda rebels\nseized  the  opportunity to act: Lord Adrjon II of Stanyrhrada rose up in the west, while the\nclergy of Adbrabohvi led an insurrection in the south.\n"

Cutting through this\ngreenery   are   nine   distinct   "groves",   each  with  their  own  distinct  ecosystems  and\ngeographical   traits.   These   groves   are  divided  into  what  is  considered  the  "West"\nDeepwoods and the "East" Deepwoods.\n\n=== West Deepwoods ===\nMountain Grove\n\nThe  Mountain Grove is uniquely the one place where the land pierces forest's canopies. It\nis  one  of  the few sources of notable mineral wealth and rock. Much of the foliage here is\nremains  largely  mundane  and  flora is comparable to that over other mountain biomes in\nCannor.\n\nLake Grove\n\nDominated  by  Silent Lake, the Lake Grove is considered one of the most tranquil groves,\nsecond  only to the River Grove. The lake itself is fed by the Ellyn River and is notable for\nwide  variety  of  aquatic life unique to the Deepwoods. These creatures vary in the degrees\nof  influence  by  the Feyrealm, but on the whole hold no significant threats to life or limb.\nThe   southern  shore  is  noted  for  a  swampier  character,  with  looming  mangrove-like\nleviathans  towering  from  the  waters, creating a tangle of roots far more perilous than the\nopen waters.\n\nBone Grove\n\nThe Bone Grove is defined by its rich soil due to extensive bone debris that litter the forest\nground.  Because  of  this,  the  both  the  forest  floor and canopy holds an unusually thick\ndensity  of  foliage  compared  with  other parts of the Deepwoods. The creatures here also\nnotable  for  frequently  being Fey-marked and are often extremely dangerous to those from\ncivilization.  Chief  of  these  dangers are the Bone-hoarders whose mere presence has been\nknown to cause extreme mental duress and even death."

Plant life\nalso takes in at larger size with many of the tallest trees being found in this grove.\n\nArrow Grove\n\nThe  Arrow  Grove  is notably the most soil poor of all the groves. Much of the plants here\nare of great age with their roots barrowing deep into the ground. What few saplings survive\ntypically  do  so  atop  fallen  ancient trees. The cause such tumbles is due to the limestone\ncaverns  beneath  which open into a maze of tunnels and gullies. Many of the creatures that\nreside  in the grove make their homes when these limestone caverns and are noted for their\ncarnivorous tendencies.\n\nFlower Grove\n\nThe  Flower  Grove is notable in bearing more resemblance to to that of tropical rainforest\nthan the temperate woods seen in other groves and how flora dominates the ecosystem. It is\nfor  these  reasons  the flora here is not only unique to all the Deepwoods but also hold the\nmost  diversity.  Notably,  most  of  these  plants are either extremely toxic or poisonous to\ncivilized   life.   What   animal   life   does   reside   in   the  grove  has  taken  on  similar\ncharacteristics."

 page_events.340.d: "\nDeepwoods  Druidism (also known as Wood Elf Druidism) is a form of magical education\ncommonly  found  within  the Deepwoods and Escann. While many cultures across Halann\nhave  some  form  of  Druidism, Deepwoods Druidism is unique in its tradition originating\nfrom  the  same  material  as  Magist  Schools.  Mages who were educated in this style and\npractice it are known as druids.\n\n== Organization ==\nDeepwoods  Druidism  is  amongst  the  more  decentralized  magical education systems in\nHalann.  Institutions  of  learning  take  the form of self organizing “druidic circles” with a\ncomplete  absence  of any central ruling body. Instead, circles typically find sister circles to\nintermittently intermingle and exchange ideas with.\n\nDue  to this uniquely grassroots organization, each circle varies in how and what it teaches.\nOne circle in the Deepwoods may focus on leveraging raw fey magic while others in Escann\nmay  follow  more  traditional  arcane  magical practices. That said, all circles focus nearly\nexclusively  on  magic  that  are  typically  classified  to  Magists as a part of the Schools of\nIllusion and Transmutation.\n\n== History ==\nDeepwoods Druidism first stemmed from the handful of mages accompanying Moon Elven\ntroops  when  they  crossed  the  Verdant Veil in 1017. Trapped for a thousand years, these\nmages and their descendants attempted to keep magical traditions alive by persevering what\nlimited  knowledge  they  had  by  ways  of  records and compendiums. However, these few\nmages  lacked  the means and resources to create a formal system of education. And, as the\nMoon  Elves  and  their descendants, the Wood Elves, began to spread and fragment across\nthe   Deepwoods,  what  few  standards  these  tomes  held  found  themselves  replaced  by\nlocalized and individualized teachings.\n\nThis,   combined  with  the  long  term  elven  exposure  to  the  Feyrealm,  would  solidify\nDeepwoods  Druidism’s  deviation from Magist schools of thought. As Moon Elves became\nWood  Elves,  mages  began  to  see  a  decline  in forms of magic that did not leverage the\nFeyrealm’s  natural energy. In response, Wood Elven mages became more reclusive, leaving\nbehind  clan  villages  to seek out ideal nexuses within the Deepwoods to practice and hone\ntheir magic, often only returning to provide intermittent care to the sick and needy or some\nother service to the locals."

Under the guidance of these hermetic druids, these\nyouth  would  be  trained  to  control  their  magic ability and continue the limited magical\ntraditions within Wood Elven society.\n\nWith these practices set, Deepwoods Druidism would see little change for centuries. It was\nonly  after  the  fall  of  Verdant  Veil in 1443 that these old ways would slowly get chipped\naway.  Indeed,  it  would  take  nearly  a hundred and fifty years before modern Deepwoods\nDruidism would truly take shape.\n\nDuring  this  time,  two  forces  would  reform  Deepwoods  Druidism.  The  first  was the\nincreasing  exposure and exchange with Escanni mages. The first Wood Elven diaspora and\nCorintari  aid  during  the  Emeraldtide would result in many druids fighting with, bonding\nwith  and learning from Escanni mages. These new understandings in learning and teaching\nmagic  would  cause  a  shift  in  druidic  upbringing  and  deeply  influence up and coming\ndruids.  The  second  factor  was  the  founding  of  Cyranvar.  With the Wood Elven clans\nunited,  disparate settlements would come together to form true towns and cities. With this\ngrowing  population  came more magically gifted children and demand for druidic services.\nSomething that individual druids were simply unable to keep up with.\n\nIn  response, in 1582, the first modern druid circle would form in the Thorn Grove.

The unique culture that emerged from the\nunion  of  Reaver  and  Lencori  was  Derannic,  named  for  their  progenitor  and Queen,\nDerhilde.\n\n== Appearance ==\nPeople  of  Deranne  are  very  similar  to  the  Lorentish  to  the point of it being basically\nimpossible to tell the two apart. The biggest differentiating factor is that Derannic are often\nblonde,  a  trait  much  rarer in Lorent and the nearly innate love for sea and sailing. Elven\nblood  is  less  prominent  in  this part of Lencenor though certainly not missing among the\nnobility.\n\n== Society ==\nBorn  of  a  scourge  from  the  sea, the Derannic have settled down considerably and share\nmany  characteristics with other Lencori cultures, however their Reaver blood has not been\nforgotten.  These  roots  are  best  seen in the Derannic propensity for maritime affairs. As\ntraders,  ship  builders, and fishermen, the Derannic are a people as salty as their crest, the\nseaflower.  They  have  not,  however neglected the land and their Eastern neighbours. The\nKnights  of  the  Seaflower  are  the elite cavalry units of Deranne, with marvelous plumage\nthat  rivals  even  the  High  Lorentish.  And  though wine is not native to the west coast of\nLencenor,  in  some  parts  of  Deranne, one may be privy to the local delicacy of Derannic\nBlood Wine."

Similar to the Mašnsih\nthey  are  a  semi-nomadic people, mainly nomadic pastoralists, with their main settlement\nbeing  the Djinn palace of Ebbušubtu. They were also the first worshippers of the Jadd, the\nyoungest  denomination  of  the  Bulwari  Sun Cult, named after the Divine-Herald Jaddar,\nleader of the Desert Elves and alleged son of the Phoenix Empress Jexis.\n\n=== Organization ===\nRather  than  being  divided  into  several  tribes  like  the Mašnsih, the Desert Elves are in\npractice   one   tribe,  as  their  social  organization  mimics  the  Phoenix  Legion  military\norganization, with the tribe being divided into clans that are successor to the legion's units.\nThe  first  leaders  of  the  Desert  Elves  were Ereleša Išazuir and Andrellion Kenszùil, the\ncommanders  of  the  Western  and  Eastern  Phoenix  legions respectively. Jaddar Jexiszuir\nbecame  the  leader after his coming of age, and after his death, the leadership passed on to\nhis  older elven son. As a result of their past and social organization, the Desert Elves are a\nmilitarized people, with the majority of the population knowing how to fight and mount.\n\n=== Origin ===\nAccording  to  the  Desert  Elves,  the  returning  legionnaires  from Haless were lost in the\ndesert,  and  they  would have died of dehydration if they hadn't been saved by the Elayenna\nharpies, who nursed them back to life. Then both groups made an arrangement, the harpies\ncould  breed  with  the  elves  in  exchange for food, water and shelter. Most of the Halessi\nlegionaries settled around Ebbušubtu and the Šad Siadan.\n\nThe  legionnaires  from  Cannor  decided  to  join  their  brothers  in  the  desert  after the\nPartition  of  Kalib,  and they brought an infant Jaddar with them. They were well received\nby  the  Mašnsih  tribes,  who  remembered  and  were  grateful  of the deeds of the Legion\nagainst  the  gnolls  and  the  Siadan harpies. The szal-Zaid tribe hosted Ereleša and Jaddar\nbefore  they  went  to  reunite  with  the  Halessi  legionnaires.  The Cannorian legionaires\nsettled  in  the  land  gifted  by  the  szal-Attalu  and  szal-Mehran tribes near Šimlardu and\nEdešukeru."

The\nspearhead was flat and leaf-shaped, and the rear of the spear was capped with a spike.

He  carried  the  spear  during the conquest of Bulwar and most of the\nEastern  campaigns.  The  most  notable  fight  during  this  time  was  Jaher’s  duel against\nPacklord Duzzak Shield-of-the-Sun, during the war against Akalšes and the Surani.\n\nThe  spear  was  broken  in  1085  in  a  battle during the second campaign against the Xia,\nwhen  Jaher  faced the wielder of Kongren, the Void's Edge. After the end of the campaign,\nthe  shards  were  given by the Phoenix Emperor to his loyal general Amarien Amarienzuir.\nThen  Amarien  divided  the fragments between her sons: Birzartan was given the shaft, and\nEletar received the spearhead.\n\nBoth  fragments  remained  in  power  of  descendants  of  Amarien  until  1453,  when the\nspearhead  ended  up  in the hands of Perzuk pobnek-Vakkra, the leader of the Marblehead\nclan,  after  he  managed  to defeat Deggarion Evranzuir.

The  average  depth  of  the  sea  is  around  2  kilometers, compared to the 3.5\nkilometer depth of Uelos' Lamet Ocean, and the 1 kilometer depth of the Ruined Sea. It is\ncolder than the Ruined Sea, but warmer than Uelos' Lament.\n\nIt  divided  into two halves- West Divenhal, and East Divenhal. East Divenhal is the elder,\nwarmer,  and  shallower  of  the  two, its shores containing Kheterata and Bulwar. It was in\nthis  sea where humans first plied the waves, and one of the safest, at least, weather-wise, in\nthe  world. It is so calm in the eastern portions of the sea that looking into the water is like\nlooking into a mirror.

The seas are inhabited\nby  the  Dog  Corsairs,  who  raid  the coasts of Sarhal and Cannor for captives to work on\ntheir farms and in their mines. The southern coasts of this sea, Akasik, were first settled by\nthe  Kheteratans,  during  the  Age  of  Awakening.  These  colonies were destroyed by The\nOnslaught,  but  were  refounded, and still exist, to this day.

He later became a chieftain for a subset of\nthe  Old  Riverfolk  and  settled  Dostan's Way briefly. Like many of the Old Riverfolk, he\nfollowed  Castan  during the First Great Cleansing and was given overlordship over his old\nhomeland,  now  renamed  to  Dostanor,  and was in charge of maintaining the frontier and\npurging the rest of the gnolls as Castan focused his efforts southwards.\n\nWhile  Dostan  accompanied  his  friend  (alongside  many  of  his warriors) south, Castan\nordered him to return and rule in his stead Dostanor in 624 BA, on the eve of his march to\nAqatbar.  While  many  scholars  and  playwrights  have romanticized this tale, we do know\nthat  in  Dostan's  personal diary stated that Castan "could not bear to lose another friend"\nin his pursuit of justice against the Xhazobine.\n\nThe  Castanorian  Citadel  of  Bal  Dostan  was  named after him and commanded by him,\nwhich gave him overlordship of the region now known as Dostanor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

In terms of the isles, the story tells of three giant brothers who\ngathered  the corpses of their already drowned brethren and stood on top of them hoping to\nkeep  themselves from drowning - unfortunately none could escape the waters and the three\nbrothers  were  said  to  be the last of the frost giants to drown, with the islands today being\ntheir floating corpses.\n\nDespite  this  myth,  modern  archaeologist  have  confirmed  that  there  are  in  fact large\nhumanoid  bones  scattered  across  the  Giant's Grave Sea, giving credence to this creation\nmyth.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe  isles  has  long  been  contested as the gateway to the Chillsbay and natural location to\ncross   from   the  west  and  eastern  Alenic  Reach  without  having  to  contend  with  the\nGreatwoods, and such it saw ownership switch frequently.\n\nBy  the  War  of the Sorcerer King the latest occupant of the isles was Chillpoint, who then\nlost it to Reachspier, their rival who had lands adjacent to the isles themselves. In 1440 the\nisles  were  lost  to  Bayvic  despite  the  efforts  of  Ricard  Frostgard who was the garrison\ncommander for the isles."

The  dragon arrived just in time to save the city of Vysamsto\nfrom  the  Cursed  Ones,  fighting  them  off  and  relieving  the  city from their siege.

The  Kingdom  quickly\nestablished  itself  as  the  major naval power in the region. and it was during this time that\nthe Pearlsedge-Verne Rivalry began.\n\n===Interregnum===\nDuring  the  Interregnum  the Kingdom of Pearlsedge was largely embroiled with wars with\ntheir rivals, the Kingdom of Verne. It was during this time that the kingdom was eventually\nconquered by the resurgent Kingdom of Dameria and became the Duchy of Pearlsedge.\n\n===Under Anbennar and the House of Trísfer===\nAs  an  extension  of  the  Kingdom  of  Dameria,  Pearlsedge  too was absorbed within the\nEmpire  of  Anbennar  during  its founding in 1221. Shortly after this the ancient House of\nPearlman  died  out  in  1262  and  their cadet branch, the elvenized House of Trísfer took\nover,   eventually   modernizing   the  duchy  against  much  to  the  chagrin  of  the  older,\nnon-elvenized nobility and peoples of Pearlsedge.\n\n===Lilac Wars===\nFor  much  of  the  Lilac Wars the duchy remained loyal to Anbennar and Emperor Vincen\nSilmuna, though like many of its neighbours, it defected to the Lorentish Rose Party during\nthe Fourth Lilac War.\n\n==Religion==\nWhile  much  of their reaver traditions are lost, Pearlsedgers have kept their affinity for the\nocean,   with   most,  in  addition  to  their  patron  deity,  paying  great  tribute  to  Munas\nMoonsinger as their god of the sea and stories like the skald-priests of their ancestors."

 page_events.398.d: "\nThe  Duchy  of  Rubenaire  (Elven:  ''Ruben's  City'')  is  a  Wine  Lord duchy within the\nKingdom  of  Lorent.  It was founded by its namesake, Ruben V Siloriel, to be given to his\nsecond son Vincen Bloodfields. Vincen would later found the House of Rubenaire, a cadet\nbranch of the royal House of Siloriel.\n\n==History==\n===Founding===\nRuben  V gifted the duchy in 1270 to his second son, Vincen, who had earned the moniker\n"Bloodfields"  during  his  time as a mercenary captain fighting in the Wars of Rule, a civil\nwar  within the Empire of Anbennar which sought to settle the debate between two forms of\nmagocratic rule: rule of mages or rule of magical nobles.\n\nDuring  this time Vincen had become a popular figure amongst the Lorentish nobility, who\nhad  seen  the  rise  of  a  recently-formed  Anbennar  as a threat and hoped that an official\nLorentish  intervention would curb any possibility of a united Anbennar in the future. With\nthis  they  saw  in  Vincen an alternative heir who would be inclined to wage war during his\nkingship, especially when compared with his brother and actual heir to the throne Laurens,\nwho was described as "gentle and reluctant" by the courtier Caldas of Ordóin.\n\nPublically,  Ruben  granted  Vincen  the duchy as a reward for his son's martial feats in the\nwar.  Privately,  it is said that he gave the duchy as a political move to distract his son from\nany  further  heroics,  placing  him  out  of  the attention of the nobles and safeguarding the\nsuccession of his firstborn Laurens.\n\nThis  eventually  worked  in  Ruben's favour, and Vincen gave up his career as a mercenary\nfor  a  life  of rule, and Laurens would eventually succeed his father with no issues. Vincen\nreturned  to  Lorent and lived the rest of his life concerning himself with the duchy's affairs\nuntil  his death in 1302. While Vincen found no further fame in the rulership of his duchy,\nby the time of his death his focus on the duchy's affairs quietly laid the foundation to make\nit one of the richest along the Bloodwine River by the start of the Lilac Wars."

In an attempt to protect against a stronger Lorentish throne and\nto  curry  favour  with  what  was  seen  by Cannor as the obvious winner, Duke Rión II síl\nRubenaire  betrothed his eldest daughter and heir, Kylia, who was 10 at the time, to Aldres\nIII  Silmuna's son Marion who was 11. As the Silmunas and the Grand Duchy of Dameria\nwere  Reán's  primary  rivals  over  the rule of Anbennar and this act of betrothal rightfully\nenraged  Reán  and  was seen by many as a festering sign of future revolt between the Wine\nLords and their parent house, the Siloriel.\n\nWhile  the  Rubenaires  did  not  fight  against  their overlord Lorent during the First Lilac\nWar, they did indeed fight against Lorent for the remainder of the Lilac Wars, as the duchy\nby  then  truly  passed  to Silmuna control under the Dukes Crossguard of Acromton which\nhad been Marion's primary title.\n\n===Return to the House of Rubenaire===\nDuring  Silmuna  rule  the  remaining Rubenaires were content to serve under their cousins\nand  acted  as  stewards,  advisors,  and  governors  for  the  two  duchies of Rubenaire and\nAcromton.   The   lesser   Rubenaire   line  survived  through  Kylia's  sister,  Eléanore  síl\nRubenaire, who had married the elven winemaker Filendor Gladeguard, cousin of the ruler\nof  the  Redglades. Together the two would perfect Rubenaire's main export, the Rubenaire\nRed wine, solidifying its place as the most popular wine in the market at the time.\n\nThe  catastrophic  Battle of the Moon Council of 1422 at the start of the Fourth Lilac War\nsaw  the  death  of  the ruler of Acromton-Rubenaire at the time, Kylian II Silmuna, which\neventually  passed  both  titles  to his nephew Alec I síl Rubenaire. Unfortunately, Alec was\ncaptured  in  the  same  battle,  and  despite  being  Duke  he  spent  the  rest  of  his short\nremainder  of  his  life  in  captivity  until  his death 1427, with his grandfather (the son of\nEléanore  and  Filendor) Rión the Reliable, who had been the steward of Rubenaire for the\nSilmunas,  took  mantle of regent (and unofficially Rión IV) and continued the war against\nLorent."

Rión, known as Rión the\nReliable  was a stalwart ally of his Silmuna kin, and as steward he supported Adénn's claim\nand continued to fight Lorent on the side of the Moon Party.\n\nUnfortunately Rión died shortly after Alec in 1430, and his son Vincen assumed control of\nas  steward,  and  instead  defected  to  the  Lorentish side. By the end of the war, Vincen's\nclaim  on  the  duchy was legitimized by the Lorentish king Kylian VI, restoring Rubenaire\nfamily   rule   over   the  duchy.  Additionally,  as  the  last  ruler  of  the  joint  duchies  of\nAcromton-Rubenaire  was his nephew Alec I síl Rubenaire, Vincen also claimed the title of\nDuke-Crossguard  of  Acromton.  This  was rejected by the new emperor, Lothane of Wex,\nwho  annexed  Acromton  for  himself  -  stating that the territory should return back to the\nGrand  Duchy  of Dameria, and if the Grand Duchy were no more (which in this case was\ntrue, as Lothane had destroyed it), that the lands would return to the holder of the imperial\nthrone, whose current occupant was Lothane himself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

It was part of the Empire\nof Anbennar.\n\nSugamber  was  known  as  "the Shield of the Empire", defending the southern borderlands\nagainst  any  incursions  by  Hill  Gnolls  and  the Busilari. The Sugamber people not only\nknow  times  of  war  and  hardship,  but also times of peace and prosperity. Sugamber was\nknown  for  its  travelling  merchants  and carnivals, this not only distracted the population\nfrom  their  grievances but also brought in tax money. Sugamber borders almost doubled in\nsize  with  the  end  of  the  Lilac  Wars  and  the  conquest  of  Countsbridge,  Gnollsgate,\nIrmathmus,  and Hawkshot. The Lilac Wars and erratic succession preferences of Ewald II\nleft Sugamber lacking in clear succession.\n\n== Sugambrian Succession Crisis ==\nFollowing  the  Lilac  Wars,  Sugamber found itself facing intense internal turmoil over the\nsuccession to the duchy. Both of the sons of the reigning duke, Ewald II síl Rhinmond, had\ndied  in  battle  during  the  Lilac  Wars,  as had his wife from disease. This left the duke's\ncousin, Ethelbert of Rupellion, as the apparent rightful heir.\n\nHowever,  Ewald  and  Ethelbert  bitterly  despised each other and had been lifelong rivals.\nEwald  instead  legitimized  his  bastard  daughter  Lisolette,  the  result  of an affair with a\nkitchen  maid,  and named her as his heir. This cut Ethelbert out of succession, and set the\nstage  for crisis. The various nobles began to take sides, with Ewald's loyalists and enemies\nof  Ethelbert  on  one,  and  on  the  other Ethelbert's allies and other nobles affronted by a\nbastard being made heir rather than one of legitimate noble blood.\n\n=== The Palace Coup ===\nOn  the 1st of Bloomsdawn 1455, at the age of 60, Duke Ewald died. Per his will Lisolette\nascended  to  the  throne.  Discussions  of  her  hypothetical  legitimacy  as  heir  turned to\ndiscontent   over   her  actual  legitimacy  as  ruler.  Seeing  their  opportunity,  Ethelbert's\nsupporters began to plot to usurp power."

On the\n4th  of  Esmarment  1458,  aided  by  the  collaborators  within the guard, the conspirators\nstormed  the  palace,  killing Lisolette and her family, and seized control for Ethelbert, who\nhimself entered the city at the head of his army a few days later.\n\n=== Civil War ===\nDespite  Ethelbert's  hopes,  nobles  loyal to Lisolette and others outraged by the coup rose\nup  in revolt, coalescing behind Ewald and Ethelbert's other cousin - Baldwin of Lockcastle\n-  whom  in  light  of  Lisolette's  death  and  Ethelbert's usurpation they proclaimed as the\nrightful duke. Across the duchy, battle lines were drawn as local nobles and even individual\ntowns and villages declared for one side or the other.\n\nMeanwhile,  the  surrounding  countries took notice. Having no stake nor interest in either\nclaimant  winning  over  the  other,  the  Grand  Duchy  of  Wex, Kingdom of Busilar, and\nMarquisate  of  Arannen  declined to intervene. However, the County of Bisan and County\nof  Celliande,  Moon  Party  members  who  had  lost land to Sugamber in the recent Lilac\nWars,  saw  an  opportunity  to  regain  their  lost  territory,  and  offered  their  support to\nBaldwin.  Celliande-supplied troops in the east moved to support Baldwin's forces directly,\nwhile  Bisan-supplied  troops  arrived  in  the  west  and  marched to besiege the fortress of\nEscandar.  Unable  to  decisively  break through the elven fortress' legendary defenses, they\nwould remain stalled here for the majority of the conflict.\n\nAs the duchy fell into disorder, the recently conquered gnolls of Gnollsgate began to agitate\nfor  rebellion, aiming to reunite with the Hill Gnolls to the south. Attempting to forestall a\nrevolt, Ethelbert instead recruited the gnolls as a mercenary force to fight against Baldwin.\n\nLarge-scale  battles began to take place, with Ethelbert and Baldwin's forces clashing across\nthe  north  and  east  of  Sugamber,  devastating  the  local  agriculture and causing a minor\nfamine.   Ethelbert   responded   by   seizing  reserves  from  local  nobles  and  merchants,\nprovoking significant protest and resentment."

Shortly afterwards,\nnobles  of  Escandar  defected  to  Baldwin,  sabotaging  its defenses. Escandar fell not long\nafter.\n\nSuffering   from  increasing  desertion  and  with  the  Bisan-supplied  troops  now  free  to\nreinforce Baldwin directly, Ethelbert was decisively defeated and his army routed in a battle\nnear  Rhinmond.  Ethelbert  fled  to  the  capital  with  what  remained  of his ducal guard,\nintending  to  hold  out for a siege. However, at the direction of the local burghers, the city\nwatch  opened  the  gates  and allowed Baldwin to enter unopposed. Ethelbert was captured\nand executed, and Baldwin formally declared duke.\n\n=== Aftermath ===\nFollowing  his  victory,  Baldwin's  supporters  were rewarded with generous shares of land\nconfiscated from Ethelbert and his allies. Bisanese and Celliander support had been crucial\nin  the  outcome,  and  in  gratitude  Baldwin  returned  the provinces of Countsbridge and\nGnollsgate  to  Bisan,  and  Hawkshot and Irmathmas to Celliande. This act created strong\nbonds  of  friendship  between  the  three countries, in an almost complete reversal of their\nprevious relationship.\n\nAt  Baldwin's  direction, the bodies of Lisolette and her family were retrieved and reburied\nwith full honours in the ducal vault.\n\n\n\n\n"

Whether it be delusions of grandeur or\nsimply  a  desire to leave the life of manual labour of most Vernman families - many young\nmustachioed Vernmen find themselves answering the call to adventure: starting off as hired\nheroes  in  their  homeland, before setting off to lands anew.

The  race  originates  from  the  underground  holds  beneath  the  Serpentspine\nMountains  east  of  Escann,  but  have  since made a home in the surface across the world,\nprimarily  in  Cannor,  due  to  the fall of their civilization long before humanity built their\nfirst cities.\n\n==Founding Myth==\nAccording  to  Cannorian  Creation  Myth  the dwarves were created by Halanna, the earth\ngoddess,  in  the  Tree  of  Stone  province  of Earthseed, in order to aid her in creating the\nworld  and  its  environments.  It  is  said  that during the Rule of Dragons and the Rule of\nGiants, which saw dragons and giants war for rulership of the earth, that the Dwarovar, the\nunderground system of roads and infrastructure that connects the Serpentspine was made.\n\n==History ==\nDwarven  civilization  is said to be one of the oldest in history and were said to have grown\nfrom  individual  independent  holds  into  a  unified  dwarven  empire  around 23,000 BA\nduring  the  Rule  of  Giants,  likely  as  an  eventual  reaction to the rise of the Frost King\nGerud.\n\nIt is not known when the Last Days of Dwarovar were, but it is very much agreed that it did\nnot  last  days,  but  instead  aeons. It was a long and incredibly slow decline marked by the\ninfighting  of  rival  holds and the collapsing authority of the dwarven empire, Aul-Dwarov.\nFor  much  of  history  the  dwarves  also  saw  goblins  as their principal enemy within the\nSerpentspine, but it was only until the rise of the orcish race that historians took account of\nthe  threat  of  the  other  underground  denizens  when  it  came  to  the  Last  Days  of the\nDwarovar.  It  has  never been agreed when the orcs rose, or what their origin is with some\nsay  they  were  made  by  the precursor elf Ducaniel but there is clear evidence of dwarven\ntablets noting their appearance dating back to 6000 BA.\n\nBy  the founding human empire of Castanor in 639 BA any semblance of a unified dwarven\nempire  had  long  fallen.  Indeed,  many  dwarves had been living amongst the burgeoning\nhuman  civilizations  by then, either through functioning surface holds such as Grôzumdihr\nin Rahen or as surface dwarves like Balgar the Builder, who was famously an exile from the\nhold  of  Khugdihr that went on to serve as an advisor to Castan the Progenitor and created\nworks such as the Castanorian citadels."

By  this  time the majority of the surface dwarves in Cannor had either lived in\nEscann like their forefathers did or amongst the wealthier lands around the Dameshead like\nthe  Empire of Anbennar. Seeing an opportunity of a Serpentspine more devoid of orcs and\ngoblins  than  usual due to being led to invade Escann during the Greentide, many dwarven\nadventurer  companies  were  founded  in  hopes to reclaim the lost holds of the Dwarovar.\nThis period of time is known as the Dwarven Reclamation.\n\n==Society==\n===Relations with Other Races===\nDwarves  are  often  a  proud  and  traditional  race,  and  due  to  their  stereotypical stoic\ndemeanour  can  be seen as quite cold to most races. Despite this, dwarves have had a long\nand  cooperative relationship with humanity as a whole, as many dwarves found themselves\namongst  the  human  tribes  of  the  world  after the Last Days of Dwarovar. Dwarves were\nlargely   responsible   for  guiding  early  human  societies  and  molding  them  in  to  true\ncivilizations,  with  many  concepts  such  as  economy  and  architecture  originating  from\ndwarven  tutelage  -  as such dwarves have been a fixture in many human nations across the\nworld, and out of all races are generally treated with the most respect by humans.\n\nIn  terms  of  enemies,  dwarves  have many. The many wrongs against dwarfkind are taken\npersonally  by  many dwarves, especially when it relates to the fall of their civilization. The\noldest   of   these  'ancestral  enemies'  are  the  goblinoids,  which  had  long  infested  the\nSerpentspine Mountains which the dwarves called home - but the most hated of these races\nare  the  orcs,  which  many  dwarves  largely  attribute  to  being  the  main  cause of their\ncivilization's  decline.  Other  races  include  giantkin for their association and cooperation\nwith  true  giants,  another  ancestral  enemy. While in more multiracial and tolerant cities\nthis  can manifest into friendlier relations, during most of the Reclamation of the Dwarovar\nmany of these 'ancestral enemies' warbands and squatter clans were killed on sight in order\nto  reclaim  their  home  and  right  the  alleged  wrongs  done  upon  their  forefathers: for\nconservative  dwarves,  the  sins  of the father do apply to the sins of the son, and their sons\nand their sons and so on."

 page_events.404.d: "\nThe  Dwarovar  Railway, or ''Dwarovrod,'' was an ancient transportation system that sat on\nthe  main  dwarven  roads  beneath  the  Serpentspine  Mountains  and connected the many\ndwarven holds. The railway tracks were made of Dagrite which were consistently electrified\nthat  not  only  allowed the Dagrite tracks to self-repair (a unique ability of the metal), but\nalso  powered  the  trains  that  made  their  way  around  the  Dwarovar.  Massive  mobile\nfoundries  were  capable  of crafting new rail on the move, in case one stopped working for\nany  reason.  At  the  height  of  Aul-Dwarov,  shanty towns were a common sight along the\nrailways.\n\n==Fall of Er-Natvir==\nThe  hold  of  Er-Natvir  was the hub of the railway and handled much of its administration\nacross  the  Dwarovar.  The  fall  of  the hold to orcs was a pivotal moment during the Last\nDays  of Dwarovar, although it didn't lead to to the immediate stopping of the railways they\nquickly  fell  into  disrepair  and  were officially declared defunct 5876 BA. Their stopping\ncut-off many holds and supplies lines that eventually led to the fall of dwarven civilization.\n\nWhen  the  railway was shutdown long-distance communication was no longer possible and\nany  dwarven  armies  in  the field, such as in the halls, tunnels and highway, fell apart from\ndisorganization  and  logistical  problems, some like Harnul the Good, who was trapped in\nthe  middle  of  the  rail  system, decided to continue on foot with his men to their original\ndestination whilst others deserted for their homes or settled at the nearest hold.\n\nThe  lack of communication led to the isolationist stance we see from dwarven holds today,\nwithout  any  effective  way  of  coordination  between  nearby  holds,  the  surviving  holds\ndeveloped  a  defensive and independent attitude and often refused to make contact or even\nhelp outsiders, dwarf or otherwise.\n\nWithout  food,  water and goods coming in through the highway, many holds fell into chaos\nand starvation.\n"

However, their reliance on the\nsurface  eventually  made  them  vulnerable  to  blockade,  especially during the time of the\nPhoenix  Empire.  Luckily  most  outer  holds  had  grown  self-sufficient  by  then but as a\nconsequence are now more selective with who they deal with.\n\nOn  the  extreme  side, some dwarves decided to abandon the Dwarovar completely.

The  establishment  of the mine led to minor incursions with the\nnative Havoric tribes, but the backing of Castanor fended off most attacks.\n\nIn  410  BA  the  mine  was  expanded  into  a dwarven road through the Divide in a bid to\nconvince  Castan  Giantsbane  to further invest in the colony as a trade route connecting to\nthe  Esmaria  region and the growing trade opportunities there. It was around this time that\nthe  mine  became  known  as  Adstunad, or the "Mine Passage" in Common.

Potential\ninvestment  was  also  limited  in 407 BA when the last True Giants led by Kranmas with a\ntroll and ogre army invaded Cannor in an attempt to re-establish the Jötunnlagen. Castanor\njoined  forces  with  several  of  the  remnant  holds  and  killed the True Giants except for\nKranmas  who  was  put  in  chains  (later  executed  by drowning). Though the colony was\nreceiving  less  support, there was an influx of dwarves following the wars of Giantsbane, so\nit  continued  to grow in this time with a smaller mining center starting at the southernmost\nend of the range.

Castanorian military support was ended in the Havoral Divide in the\nscramble  following  the  sudden death of Castan the Perished. Without the presence of the\nEmpire,  the  Havorton Clan assaulted Adstunad, taking it from the dwarves. Following the\nloss  of  the primary mining center, most dwarves retreated to the walls of Castanor. Those\nthat  remained  sought  refuge  in  the  smaller  mining  center  to the south. This hardship\ncombined  with  the  commitment  to  the  Divide engendered a culture separate from most\ndwarves who still longed for a return to the Serpentspine and Aul-Dwarov.\n\nThe  Havoric  tribes  then  entered  a  period  of  consolidation,  forming  the  Kingdom of\nHavoral.

The  pantheon  is  led  by  Dagrin  Everbeard  who  was  the first dwarf to be\ncreated  by  Halanna  and  acts  as  the wise king of the gods. The religion was practised all\naround  Aul-Dwarov  until the invasion of the orcs and long after the fall of Amldihr.

As the dwarves lost hope in their\ngods with such a devastating attack on the Dwarovar, many lost faith in the belief, choosing\nto  convert  to  Ancestor  Worship.  A  large  conversion  happened during the Segbandalic\nGolden  Age  in  3590  BA  as  the  dwarven  population  of  the  Segbandal slowly began a\ntransition  to  modern  Ancestor  Worship.  Some  holds  stood stalwart in their faith, with\nOvdal-az-Ân  accepting  the pilgrims who had moved out of Ovdal Kanzad in 3859 BA due\nto  the  hold’s  conversion  to  Ancestor  Worship, further strengthening the presence of the\nCult of Halanna in Ovdal-az-Ân.\n\nBy  the  time  of  the  first  major  dwarven  adventurer  company  expeditions  in 1443, no\nremaining  hold  within  the  Dwarovar  followed  the  Dwarven Pantheon faith, with every\nsurviving remnant hold following the Ancestor Worship faith.\n\n==Split from Ancestor Worship=="

These  processes  he  would  become the expert in, in short order, discovering\nwhat   could   and   could   not  be  made  into  alcohol.

Purifying the metal he poured it into a crucible, and\nadded  gemstone  dust and bone ash, uttering prayers to Halanna as he did so. Unknown to\nhim, the gemstone he scattered was a stone crafted from Joztralanna’s Essence.\n\nFrom  this  emerged  a  woman  with a form of steel and eyes of gold, Lady Argezenna. She\ntaught Azmirethazin the secrets of the forge and led him on a journey the world over for the\nmaterials to create a forge of their own. Upon her return she took his hand in marriage and\ntogether had a son and two daughters with Azmirethazin.\n\n====Auirikus, The Hand of Dagrin, Organizer of the Gods====\nAs  Dagrin’s  domain  grew,  so  too  did  the need to organise it all. Realising that while he\nruled,  he needed someone to spread his decrees and ensure they were followed. In this, he\nsought  a  dwarf  who would listen to his tasks and would remain on the course. One dwarf\nin particular stood above the rest, and he was named Auirikus.\n\nWith  this  knowledge,  Dagrin  raised  him to a Divine State, and made Auirikus his hand\nand  steward  to  ensure  that  all  within his realm occurred as it should, and all tasks were\nfollowed  to  the letter. Auirikus did so, driving fear and terror into the hearts of those who\nwere  found  lacking  in  their  efforts,  and  casting  down  shoddy or incomplete work as a\ndisgrace to Dagrin.\n\n====Urisazirn Mithrilhand, Runecraft & Scholars====\nFirst  son  of  Durvorazir,  Urisazirn  did  not  match  the strength of his father, but instead\npossessed a cunning and curiosity unparalleled by any other. He sought to truly understand\nHalanna’s  plan for the world, documenting and recording all that he could in an attempt to\ncollect all the information in a single place.\n\nAfter   a  time,  he  sought  more  and  more  knowledge  and  wisdom.  The  Dwarves,  in\ncomparison  to  the  Dragons  and  the  Giants,  did  not  have  magic to their scale. In the\ndisputes  between the two, it was the dwarves who were trampled underfoot. Seeing this, he\ndeveloped  a  way  to  channel  the  latent  magic within the earth itself, channeling it into a\nform  of  language  that  could  harness  the  magic  in  a  dwarves’ stead. This was the first\nRunework, and the history of dwarven civilization was forever changed afterwards."

Originally a common dwarf\nwith  a  gift  of  speech and song, he made a performance that enraptured the very hearts of\nthe Divines themselves. Rewarded with divinity by Dagrin himself, he was sent out into the\nworld beyond the mountain homes to act as his eyes and ears.\n\n====Grimthar, Shaper of Trees and Woodcarver====\nWhen  the  first  trees  emerged,  it was Grimthar who peered from the mountain halls and\nsaw  their  worth.  Traversing  the  newly  emerging  forests, he taught himself to shape and\ncarve  them into intricate forms and learned of their uses- including teaching Margurz what\nparts  can  be turned into alcohol, and created for him barrels to better ferment and impart\nhis  creations  with  new  and  interesting  flavours.

Pious and devout to the\ngods,  she  took  no  husband and sired no children, even as her hold grew fruitful and rich\nfrom  the  grains of the Vale.

In that age, the Void itself invaded Creation, and\nwhen  it  departed,  Grobilazk was left behind. But Grobilazk was a cowardly creature, and\nhad  always  loathed its masters. Caught in the purifying blast of the Primordials, they were\nanchored to this world and strove to keep beneath the notice of the seven beings that lorded\nover it.\n\nHowever,   when  they  began  to  sculpt  the  world,  and  Halanna  created  the  Dwarves,\nGrobilazk  grew  jealous.  Stealing  some of Joztralanna’s gifts, he took the stone and took a\ncave  chameleon,  and  rendered it into his image. For Grobilazk lacked the ability to truly\nimagine  new things, instead, he would take what was there and make it into something that\nwould  suit  his needs. In doing so, he created Goblins. As the ages continued, he would in\nturn  create Bugbears and Hobgoblins in an effort to prove himself better than Halanna and\nher Dwarven children."

Social norms are important to the Damerians.\nThey  have  a  reputation  for  being  tolerant  and  valuing people on their merit and talent\nrather  than  their  origin.  The  East  Damerians  generally  look  up to the elves and elven\nculture.  The  Lorentish  and  Wexonards were regarded with distrust and animosity due to\ntheir long-time rivalry, especially after the Lilac Wars.\n\n== Religion ==\nThe  East  Damerians  were  traditionally  worshippers of the Regent Court, and their most\ncommon  deities  of  choice  were The Dame and Munas Moonsinger. However in modern\ntimes, they have largely moved to Ravelianism and the Corinite Faith.\n\n\n"

 page_events.417.d: "\nEawuba  Kayba  Reef  ('Great  Forest  Reef')  is  the  largest  reef  known in Halann and is\nlocated  on the north eastern portion of Ardimya. The reef is home to a plethora of aquatic\ncreatures,  spanning  numerous  miles, the coral provides refuge to fish, lobsters, seahorses,\nsea  turtles,  and  various  creatures  unique  to  the  reef. Being thousands of years old, it's\nreasoned  that  they have been able to exponentially flourish compared to other reefs due to\nfey influence, indicated by the large number of Nummo that reside within the reef.\n\nThe  reef  prevents  erosion along with serving as a buffer against waves, storm, and floods.\nThis  effect  is  doubled by the Nummo keeping the coastal Guryadagga people safe, except\nwhen  angered the storms are said to be more dangerous than ever and the sealines buffeted\nby waves.\n\n== Merfolk ==\nThe local merfolk tribe dwells in and around the reef, keeping a medium distance from the\ncoastal  people  unlike  many other merfolk as they prefer to live on the reef. They are still\nquite integrated, the sacred pact still considered important. The culture has been shaped by\nthe  prominent  Nummos,  who  are  a  powerful  force  that protects the reef including the\nmerfolk that live within.\n\nThe  merfolk  are typically agrarian, relying on seaweed or foraging for food although some\npartake  in  hunting. The villages are scattered throughout the reef, many camouflaging and\nblending in to the environment.\n\n== Fey Effect ==\nAlthough  the  fey  influence  has  waned since the Day of Ashen Skies, as no new Nummos\nhave  appeared since then, it still plays a prominent role in the reef. Entering a coral can be\nunpredictable, and you may find yourself exiting on the other side of the reef or some place\nelse random.\n\nThe  fey  has  too  effected  particular individuals amongst the Guryadagga who have closer\nbonds  to  the  reef,  often  granting  them gills in addition to their lungs that allow them to\nswim  amongst  the  merfolk  much  like  the  merfolk  have created ways to live among the\ncoastal people."

When large enough and the tide is strong, a part\nof  them  is  whisked away to repeat the process. They are also quite tasty and are a favorite\namong the merfolk.\n*  Shelods:  Social  molluscs of medium size that gather into pods of a dozen members. Of\nsimilar  intelligence  to  pixies,  they  typically  spend  their time gathering various colorful\nshells  and  materials  to  be  used  as  dwellings  or  make  simple  art  (perhaps  in  vague\ndedication to the Seelie Court).\n* Rainbow Fins: A type of ray finned fish renowned for coming in a variety of colors. Their\nfins  and scales make for excellent dyes that the merfolk make use of in their clothing, they\nare a favorite form of prey for Shelods.\n*  Silts:  Typically  small  bottom feeding crustaceans, silts start off as the size of actual silt\ngiving  them  their  name.  They  are  notable  in  that  they  can  grow  and  seemingly live\nindefinitely, though very few get a chance to do so at the bottom of the food chain.\n*  Singing  Coral:  One  of  the  many  types  of coral in the reef, these coral are known for\nresponding  to  magic (fey magic in particular) and "singing" in response. When harvested\nand properly prepared they make effective detectors of fey presence.\n*  Clops:  Extremely  aggressive  and  asocial crustaceans, clops are capable of regenerating\nlost  limbs  and  even  their  heads  so  long as their hearts remain beating. Clops in recent\nyears have been jokingly called honorary members of the Unseelie Court for their stubborn\nundying nature.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Speculated  to  be  a  Precursor  experiment  that  got  free when the city of Affelai\ncrashed,  the  plant  then  expanded  into  the  hive-mind  jungle  known today. The jungle,\noccupied  mostly  by  the  native  Ruinborn,  is  incredibly  dangerous  due  to its ability to\nconstantly  expand,  such  as by taking over plants through its extending roots, yet is widely\nregarded as one of the most beautiful places on Halann due to its biodiversity.\n\n== Physiology ==\nAppearing  as  a dense jungle, the Effelai is in truth one living organism, with an evidenced\nnervous system running to the individual parts of it. Believed to originate somewhere in the\nregion  of  Effelai  Proper,  biologists theorize that the plant has a heart located in the crash\nsite of Affelai but this has never been confirmed.\n\nMuch  of  the  jungle  contains  fauna  and flora that is impossible to find anywhere else on\nHalann,  such  as  the...  More  often  dangerous  than not, parts of the Effelai, such as the\nregion  surrounding  Affelai  itself  as  written  by Teagan Cottersea, have been described as\njewels.\n\nThe  most  dangerous  ability  integral  to  the Effelai is its capability to invade one's mind,\ncreating  creatures known as Seedthralls. Inflicted with a "zombie-like" state, victims seem\nto  lose all sense of self and reasoning, becoming "servants" to the hive-mind, connected to\nit  through its neural network. Even without taking over one's mind, the jungle is addictive,\nwith  many  who  enter  it becoming unwilling to leave such as Teagan Cottersea. For these\nreasons and its deadly inhabitants, the region is known as one of the deadliest on Halann.\n\nDespite  the  recent  mass  extinction  event  of  the  Day  of  Ashen Skies, it is theorized in\nHabil's  ''Theory  of  Speciation''  that  magical  radiation  actually caused mass speciation\nevents  for  all  forms  of  life  and  not  just ruinborn. It is further believed that the Effelai\norganism  itself has been a major catalyst for evolution of other organisms whether to resist\nits  influence  or  live  in  symbiosis.  Such  creatures  include  those  that sing to resist the\nEffelai's effect (as will be explored later), the mushroom forest, and more."

In fact, the jungle itself, when exposed to air, resonates\nand  "sings".  When  animals,  humanoids  included,  are  turned  into Seedthralls they are\nknown  to  sway  to  the  rhythm  with  the  noise  of the jungle.

A\nvariety  of reasons drew adventurers to the jungle. Rumors of biological and magical effects\nthat  could  be  harnessed  from the uniqueness of the jungle brought about these powers in\ndroves. The massive reserve of living wealth in the Effelai is said to have created the largest\nsurge  of  adventurer  activity since the Greentide, spearheaded by the Foolfoot Expedition.\nThese  adventurers  would  trudge  through  the  jungle,  under  threat from fauna and flora\nalike,  in  search of rare flowers or organisms said to have the power to change the fortunes\nof  a  nation.  Mages and Artificers both sought to experiment and get their hands on exotic\nplants and animals, merchants too.\n\nWhile  some  nations  took  advantage  of  the  knowledge  that native ruinborn had, others\nfought  against  the local inhabitants who would then use the jungle against them.

Worship of the jungle goddess is\nvery  similar  in Leechden to the rest of Effelai, but with a greater focus on human sacrifice\nand the more deadly aspects of the jungle.\n* Song Servants - The song servants are direct vassals of the Effelai jungle itself, having lost\nall humanity.

They age naturally at the same rate humans from infancy until their\nmid-twenties  (give  or  take).  After  that,  elves  no  longer  show  signs  of  aging such as\nwrinkles,  sagging skin or graying hair - that is, except for their eyes, which seem to be bear\nthe brunt of their age, often becoming dull and even cloudy at extreme ages.\n\nIn  addition  to  not  showing the visible signs of ageing, elves also do not suffer any sort of\ninfirmities  that  comes  with  old  age  such  as weak joints, deteriorating organs and being\nsusceptible  to  certain diseases.

They do,\nhowever,  have pregnancies and reach sexual maturity (the ability to reproduce) at the same\ntime  as humans. Due to cultural differences, however, elves often wait until they reach the\nage  of  100  years  or  more  before  having children.

The elven population, as a whole, while still affected by the\npestilence,  were  less  likely  to catch the disease and had an easier time of recovery if they\ndid  catch  it.

This goes to the point that elves often take\ndifferent  names  and  guises  during  adolescence.  To  some  elves, this period is a time of\nembarrassment  best  left unspoken, to others, it is regarded as another life completely, one\nthat is often left behind.\n\n====Young Adulthood (100 - 200)====\nElves  in this stage are expected to be moving towards their desired path of paths of choice,\nsuch  as  what  craft to follow or career to pursue. An elf's identity should consistent by the\nend  of this stage compared to the more tumultuous years of adolescence. This is also when\nelves  often  pair  up  with  non-elves on a serious basis, becoming husbands and wives and\nbearing half-elven progeny rather than one-off flings and abandoned children."

While some others existed, they in time either\nfell  to  the  region's  great  powers,  as  the  Elfrealm of Venáil did or were only nominally\nindependent,  such  as  the  Elfrealm  of Moonhaven or the Elfrealm of the Redglades. The\nElfrealm  of  Ibevar  stands  as  the  definitively  independent  elven  power of Cannor, and\ncommands  great  respect  from  all  elves  as  a  result,  additionally  being  the  only elven\nmonarchy in Cannor.\n\n==History==\n===Founding===\nShortly  after  The  Landing  the elven hero Munas Moonsinger called for all his kin to aid\nthe  League  of  Free  Realms,  which  many  did.  Some  disagreed  with  this  notion, like\nMaldorian  the Navigator who rejected war entirely and left with his followers to the north,\nbut  for  Ibenion  ta'Lunateín  and fellow elder Ianren the Rider they agreed for help but in\nexchange of establishing their own true realms for elves in the new land.\n\nWhen the war stretched to central Cannor and skirmishes began in the Forlorn Vale, many\nhumans  refused  to  fight  due  to  the  land's  dark  history.  In  this Ibenion and his elven\nfollowers volunteered to fight in the dark woods, but it was only after the rediscovery of the\nlong lost Cardesti capital of Vardoced that Ibenion began settling the region.\n\nBy  the  end  of  the  War  of  the  Sorcerer-King  the  Forlorn  Vale  was  divided between\nmembers  of  the  League  of  Free  Realms: his own realm, Ibevar, the human kingdom of\nMartin  Farran  and  the  Elfrealm  of  the  Cursewood,  who  had  formerly  been  part  of\nIbenion's dominion and split due to Ibenion's bias towards the elves of the Lunateín.\n\nAs  part  of  the  Treaty of Anbenncóst, the southern Disputed Lands, another name for the\nForlorn  Vale, was granted to Ibenion to act as its protector against any further Castanorian\nthreats,  much  to  the  chagrin of Martin, who had settled years before Ibenion's discovery\nand resettlement of Vardoced."

Defensive lines at Larthán and the Blaíddscal\nlargely  protected  Ibevar's populace from the shambling dead. Elves, due to some quirk of\nthe  pestillence were less receptive to its ill effects, allowing for Ibevar to stand firm against\nthe disease.\n\n==="Chivalric" Skirmishes===\nWhile  Ibevar  has  largely  maintained  a  quiet  history  the  Farrani  border  was  long an\nill-defined  source  of  conflict,  with  bloody  skirmishes and centuries-long feuds between\nfamilies  on  either  side  of  it.  At  times, Ibevar would send the greatest champions of the\nBlaíddscal  to  settle  disputes in a contest of Diranbe bladework against the finest of the síl\nna  Eán  line  in  the  tradition  of  Escanni  Chivalry. However, it was just as often that the\ncommon folk would fight proxy wars, haughtily condemned by both sides as border villages\nburned or flipped allegiance between the realms.\n\n===The Greentide===\nThe longstanding rivalry between the Farrani and Ibevari would come to an end around the\nyear  1442,  where  Dookanson's  thralls  first reached the borders of Farraneán, eventually\nforcing   the   abandonment  of  Farran's  kingdom,  save  for  holdouts  in  Freetower  and\nValefort. Beginning without the sanction of the state, Ibevari soldiers and adventurers, such\nas  Pelodir  I  Casna,  later the founder of Pelodaire cast aside the bad blood of generations\nand  aided  in the evacuation of the Farrani Caseán towns. While he cannot be given credit\nfor the effort in and of itself, Ibenion II ta'Luneteín did relent and facilitate the transport of\nthe  human  and  half-elven  Farrani  to  Esmaria  or  Aldresia,  and offered in goodwill the\nchance for any willing Farrani elves to settle in Ibevar with any past wrongs forgiven.\n"

In  exchange for Ibevar's aid in the war, the Duchy of Asheniande was\nforced to cede Téinmas to Ibevar, creating a southern march that would keep the squabbles\nof the empire further from its forest heartland.\n\n===A Syncretic Reformation===\nFollowing  the  great disruptions of the Lilac Wars and the The Greentide, a period known\nas  the  Ibevar  Reformation  began.  Seeking to carve a new place in a changing world that\nwas  quickly  leaving  Ibevar  behind, the strongheaded leadership of Ibenion II ta'Luneteín\npushed  for  the  conversion  of  the  country's  population,  who  had  clung  to  the  Elven\nForebears  far  longer than all but the Elfrealm of Venáil or Silent Repose (which was soon\nintegrated  into Ibevar). These efforts emphasized a syncretism of Ibevar's traditional Elven\nForebears worship with that of Munas Moonsinger and The Dame. The theology pushed in\nthis  reformation,  in  a  framework  largely constructed by theologian and priest of Munas,\nErelas  Starwatcher,  who  asserted  that  as  Nerat  rules over the human dead, so too does\nMunas rule over the souls of deceased elves, elevating Him to the most prominent position\nin the nation's traditional worship of the Regent Court.\n\n===The Humans' War===\nThe  Syncretic  forms  of Worship popularized in Ibevar put enough emphasis on the Elves'\ndistinct role under Munas to create something of an apathy toward the conflict between the\nCorinites  and  Adean's  followers,  which  were seen as the "humans' war", over who held\ntheir  souls.  This apathy was a major contribution to the nation's reputed neutrality. Close\nties  to  Bennon  established  during  the  refugee  crisis  of  the  Greentide  allowed for the\nCouncil  of  the  Ancients  to  pass  a  bill to Ibenion II ta'Luneteín which was essentially a\ncopy of the Declaration of Religious Compromise, stating that Ibevar, like Bennon, had no\nbusiness in resolving the squabbles of Corin and Adean."

Due to this, Ibevar produces some of the best marksmen in Cannor, each\ncapable  of pinning down foes with deadly efficiency. Though originally bowmen, these laid\nthe foundation for later sharpshooters, who even surpassed the range of their forebears after\nthe adoption of rifled firearms. The Blaíddscal is noted for producing an aggressive style of\nmartial command atypical of most elven armies.\n\n===Notable Goods===\n*Varilleni,  a  dry  red wine produced in the Varillen region of Ibevar is of special note due\nto  the  finer  varieties  possessing  magical  properties  that  adapt the wine to the drinker's\npalette, and produce a distinct glow when infused with magic. Though originally created as\na  mark  to  prove  the legitimacy and quality of the finer varieties, it quickly usurped other\nfeatures of the wine to become its most notable aspect.\n*Núraelic  Linen  is one of the more notable cloths in Ibevar. While some silk is produced\nin  the area, the flaxen fields of Thanas have long supplied Ibevar with its most sought-after\ncloth.

Originating  as  a  way  for  Cartmakers  to  test  the\ndurability  of their creations, the races have grown to be one of the largest draws of tourism\nto  the  region,  and  created  a  prominent  center  of  development  for  horseless carts, as\nartificers from around the world gather to test their creations at the sport's birthplace.\n\n==Geography==\nIbevar  is  largely  filled  with  heavy,  dense forests reminscent of the Greatwoods or Inner\nCastanor,  which,  along  with  the  Havoral Divide and regions like Larthán and Carodir's\nPass  have  made invading the region quite an undesirable prospect. The few wars that have\nmade  it  onto  Ibevari soil have demonstrated the elves' extensive knowledge of their home\nterrain,  with  guerilla  warfare  using  finely  honed  ambush  tactics  developed  in  border\nskirmishes with the Farrani helping to maintain the realm's sovereignty into modernity.\n\nThe  heartland  of  the  Elfrealm  lies  along  the Hehainé river, with its most populous and\nprosperous  cities  in  a  straight  run  from  Núrael  to  Ár  Éinnas, the whole of it densely\nforested even to the modern day. Appealing to the eye of the romantic, from city to country,\nthe  whole  of  Ibevar  is shaped with an aesthetic that maintains the natural landscape, and\nholds  some  of  the last old-growth forest outside the Deepwoods and those recesses of the\nGreatwoods  that  have  not  been  marred  by  the  development  of the Northern League's\nindustry in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries."

Its ports and cities are major hubs of activities for trade and\nshipbuilding  in  the  Dameshead.  It  is  home  to  the majority of Elves in the Empire. Its\ncapital is the Eponymously named city of Moonhaven.\n== History ==\n\n==== Pre-Landing ====\nThe  Silverwoods  which  make  up  the  majority  of what would become Moonhaven were\nsparsely  inhabited  by the Damerian people prior to the Elven landing, and was part of the\ncorelands of the Damerian Republic and Damerian Kingdom\n\n==== Bluetongue Era ====\n\n===== Founding =====\nMoonhaven  was one of the several Elfrealms created after the War of the Sorcerer-King to\nserve  as  a  new home for the Moon Elves. It was granted by King Marion I of Dameria in\n1021  AA,  to  his  uncle Varilor Bluetongue for his service as Admiral of the Free Realm’s\ncombined  fleet.  The  realm  would serve as a vassal to the Kingdom and would remain so\nunder  the  Jexisian  Empire  and  subsequently the Grand Duchy of Dameria following the\nformation  of  the  Empire  of  Anbennar.  Varilor’s  new  realm would be given the title of\nprincipality,  as all other newly created Elfrealms were. As a prince ranks below a king, the\nCannorian  monarchs  who  would  grant  lands  to  the  newly arrived Elves chose this title\ndeliberately  to  ensure  that  the  status  quo  would be kept and Elves would not usurp the\npossessions  of  humans.  Varilor  would name his new lands Moonhaven as a refuge for all\nMoon Elves. The Principality would follow the electoral succession laws that the Elves had\ndeveloped  at  sea  during  the  Great  Wander.  In  practice however, it would be ruled for\ncenturies by the founding Bluetongue dynasty, passing from father to son upon death.\n\n===== Development =====\nRule  under  Varilor  and  his  descendants  would  see the Silverwoods transformed from a\nsparsely  populated backwater to a thriving center of trade and artisanal craftsmanship. Tea\nseeds  from  Aelantir  would  be  planted  soon  after the establishment of the Elfrealm and\nwould grow into a lucrative trade following Cannor’s Elvenization in the 12th Century. The\nplentiful lumber of the Silverwoods would also be highly sought after by shipbuilders for its\ndurable  qualities.  Port  Munas,  initially  founded  as a supply port during the War of the\nSorcerer-King,  it  would  be heavily developed at the mouth of the Luna River. The city is\nnamed  after  the  brother  of  Varilor  and  recently  ascended  God,  Munas  Moonsinger.\nHumans  from  Anbenncost  would  be  invited  to  settle  in  the  city which would lead its\nhuman  inhabitants  to  be  much  more culturally similar to the people of Anbenncost than\nthe rest of Moonhaven’s human citizens."

Finorian\nBluetongue,  younger  son  of  Varilor  and Prince of Moonhaven would be chosen as Jexis’\nsteward  and  governor  of  the  East Dameshead. His great oratory skills aided by his close\nproximity  in  age  to  Jexis  would  lead  to  them  developing a close friendship. Upon the\nDeath  of  Jexis  in 1162, Finorian would briefly attempt to keep the Cannorian portion of\nthe  empire  together,  but  with  the  only  remaining  descendant  of Jaher being Elizar the\nBlooded,  his disinherited, infamously cruel,and unstable son, none could agree on the next\nPhoenix  Emperor  and  the  realm would fall into civil war. Dameria would quickly regain\nindependence with Moonhaven as a vassal once again.\n\n===== Integration into Anbennar =====\nFollowing  Dameira’s  integration  into  Anbennar  as  a  Grand  Duchy  and  being granted\nElectorship  representing the Dameshead in 1221, the Prince of Moonhaven would also be\ngranted  the  status  of  Elector representing the interest of Elves in the Empire, both inside\nand  outside  of Moonhaven. With a great sway over Anbennarian politics, the dual electors\nwould  ensure  Damerian  dominance  over  the Empire, with Silmunas (rulers of Dameria\nand a Bluetongue Cadet House) being elected to Dove Throne a multitude of times. These\nclose  relations  with  the rest of Cannor would see the Elves of Moonhaven become highly\nCannorized  with  them  adopting the Cannorian Pantheon, customs, and traditions of their\nhuman neighbors. Many Moonhaveners would consider both Moon Elven and Common as\ntheir native tongues.\n\n==== Dissolution of the Grand Duchy of Dameria and Independence ====\n\n===== The Lilac Wars and aftermath =====\nThe  Lilac  Wars  (1348-1443  AA)  would  see  the  Grand  Duchy  of  Dameria  and the\nKingdom  of  Lorent  battling over the thrones of both Lorent and Anbennar. As a vassal of\nDameria, Varion I Bluetongue and his army would participate heavily in the battles against\nLorent  and  their  allies. Despite this, Dameria would be eventually defeated and forced to\nsurrender.

A  largely  bloodless  revolution  would  ensue  resulting from the Lorentish\nblockade of Anbennar at the time making sending soldiers to suppress it impossible.\n\n===== Unification =====\nIn  the  17th  Century,  Camir  Silmuna,  king  of Nurcestir, would be invited by Coronite\nprinces  to  rule  the  empire. Under him, Anbennar would be united into a modern nation\nstate and Moonhaven would become one of the many feudal realms absorbed into it.\n\n== Culture and Faith ==\nOwing  to  their  long  history  of  intermingling  with humans, the elves of Moonhaven are\nparticularly  Cannorized even when compared to other Cannorian Elves. Despite this many\nElven  traditions  are  still  practiced. The devout worship of Munas among Moonhaveners\nand  their  origins  in the Remnant Fleet has inspired many to devote their long lives to the\nmastery  of  sailing  and  shipbuilding.

He was one of the thousands of gods of the\nBulwari  Pantheon,  and  descended  from  it  to  lead  his  chosen  people  away  from  the\noppression  of  the  Bulwari God-kings. He had many names, depending upon what he was\ndoing  at  the  time.  Elikhet  the  Renouncer,  after  he  abandoned  godhood.  Elikhet the\nArchitect,  after  turning  what was formerly desert into the greatest nation on Halann, with\nwonders  across  it.  Elikhet  the  Avenger, when he banished the genies of the Salahad who\ntried  to  enslave  his  people.  Elikhet  the  Wanderer,  when  he  explored  the world, and\nfounded  many  cities  which still exist to this day. Elikhet the Provider, after creating feasts\nto  feed  his  people  after  the  fields  were  burned  in  The  Onslaught.  And  Elikhet  the\nResurgent, after the Day of Ashen Skies occurred, and he returned to life.\n\nElikhet  behaved very differently than all other Khet, being capable of leaving the Mother's\nSorrow  and  seeming  to  have  a  broader  set of abilities rather than the water-based feats\nother Khet are capable of, leading some to question if he truly qualifies as one of the Khet.\nA minority of scholars believe such feats could be achieved by any Khet, but no others have\nlived long enough.\n\n===History===\nElikhet  is  the  divine  founder of the Kingdom of Kheterata, claimed as the longest-lasting\nhuman  realm  in  the  world,  founded  three  thousand years before the Day of Ashes. His\nearliest  recorded  action  was  descending from the heavens to lead his people, the original\nKheteratans,  away from the tyranny of the Bulwari God-Kings - many scholars believe this\nto be a religious interpretation of Elikhet himself having been a God-King who rejected the\ntyrannical  measures of his fellows and so left to found a new kingdom, with Elikhet having\ncreated  the  Sorrow  as well as the Khet using unknown magics. Regardless of his origin, it\nis known that a land once categorized as a blasted desert inhabited only by exiled djinn and\nroaming  gnoll  tribes  in  Precursor  records  would  become  a  fertile  river  valley with a\ngrowing human civilization.\n\nIn  the  early  stages  of  his  rule,  Elikhet  would fight a war in the desert against the djinn\nsultanates  and  gnoll  tribes  of  the Salahadesi. It is believed that Kheterat itself, capital of\nthe  kingdom,  was  built  near  the  flooded  ruins  of  a  major genie city - indicating that,\nperhaps,  the  Sorrow  was  created  to  be  as  much  a weapon as a source of water. By all\naccounts,  Elikhet  was  wildly successful, and drove djinn and gnoll alike out of the central\nSalahadesi  -  though  certain  gnoll  tribes  instead  accepted  a form of vassalage, acting as\nguard  dogs against their hostile fellows in exchange for gifts from Elikhet's Court. Though\nthese  gifts  were  usually  baubles or tokens, Elikhet would sometimes grant a gnoll pack a\npersonal  favor.  Most  notably,  he  is  said  to  have once created a second tributary of the\nSorrow  to  provide  water for a thirsty but loyal pack, a river known now as the Krah. It is\nalso  recorded that these loyalist packs would provide the Kheteratan Kingdom with slaves,\ncaptured from the humans further south, as tribute."

At this time, Elkmarch stretched eastward to meet\nthe  Dameshead,  including the lands that would become Uelaire, then called Minsford.

Preemptively, Lorent\nextended   a   protectorate   over  the  Small  Country,  Elkmarch  included.  Nevertheless,\nCastanorian  forces  invaded,  taking  the  northern  fort of the Approach.

Damerian forces under the command of Eustace síl Uelaire would\nliberate  the  eastern  coast  for  the  League  of Free Realms, only to remain occupying the\nlands following the end of the invasion in 1007.\n\nThe  Treaty of Anbenncóst guaranteed Elkmarch's independence but also recognized that of\nUelaire.  Incensed,  Sybille  Locke  declared  war to reclaim what was perceived as rightful\nOakfoot  lands.  Uelaire  defeated  them,  yet  the  claims  remained;  the conflict between\nElkmarch and Uelaire simmered on and off for many decades as low-intensity guerilla war,\nleading in part to the increased paranoia of the Uelairey.\n\nElkmarch  was  later  annexed by Gawed, and the local Oakfoot culture blended with those\nof  the  other  northern  halfling vassals to form the Bluefoot culture. In the mid-1500s the\ninhabitants  would  participate in the Small Country Rebellion and join the Small Country,\nwith Elkmarch's irredentism lending claims to the lands of Uelaire."

Indeed,  they did not see themselves as colonists at all, but rather the rightful\nreclaimers  of  Aelantir,  clinging  to  their  lineage  from  the Precursor Elves. Despite the\nkingdom  of  Lorent  being  the  one  who gave patronage to Endral the Explorer, it was too\npreoccupied by continental affairs at the time to act on its designs on Aelantir. The Venáili\nseized  that  opportunity  to  "reclaim  their  homeland"  and  started  migrating  en masse,\neventually moving their entire population overseas.\n\nHowever,  due  to  their  small  population, the elves could not settle most of their claimed\nterritory.  Rather,  they  set  up  tiny  outposts  throughout  the  islands of Endralliande and\nconcentrated  most  of  their  population  on  the  Bloodgroves  east  coast.  They began an\nextermination campaign against the degenerated Bloodfeeders and drove off both the native\npeoples  and  Cannorian  settlers from the area, starting a decades-long guerilla war against\nboth of them.\n\nBy  the  1550s,  the Venáili had established a power base around their capital of Sella. The\ncountry's  ruler,  Aldarian  Seawatcher,  proclaimed  the  creation  of the empire of Aelnar,\nclaiming continuity with the Precursor Empire. This was well-received by most Cannorians\nat the time, who sympathized with the elves' desire to return to their homeland.\n\n==Rianvisa ==\nHowever,  serious  political  disagreements were on the rise in newly-formed Aelnar. With\nthe  entire country focused on colonization efforts above all else, little thought was given to\nestablishing  political  institutions. These tensions boiled over when Emperor Aldarian was\nmysteriously   assassinated,   as   several   elves   claimed  the  throne  at  once,  each  with\nirreconcilable visions for the country.

With the ongoing civil war, and\nthe  low  amount  of  elves  actually  present  on  Endralliande, Lorent easily conquered the\nisland, although many orcish slaves managed to flee.\n\nThe  civil  war dragged on for decades, but eventually the upper hand was gained by Lithiel\nOathkeeper,  a  former  adventurer and powerful mage. Lithiel enjoyed widespread popular\nsupport  because  of  her fame as the first Venáili to ever set foot in Aelantir. However, the\ntrauma  of the civil war led her to insanity (although some now-disproved theories claimed\nghostly  possession).  She  began  calling herself Elissa and believed that since Aelnari elves\nwere   the  "rightful"  rulers  of  Aelantir,  all  other  inhabitants  must  be  conquered  and\neradicated.

Lorent declared war upon Aelnar, invading from the sea.\nBesieged  from  all  sides,  fighting  against  itself  and  the  guerillas of the forest, by 1630\nAelnar  was  not  only defeated, but entirely destroyed as their fanatical forces kept fighting\neven when defeat was obvious."

This did not go well with\nmany  of  the  other  electors, as well as the other minor nobility within the Empire and the\nLilac Wars soon began, with the first objective to oust the Lorentish Emperor.\n\nIn  1364,  17  years  after  the  start  of  the  First  Lilac  War, Reán was slain in battle and\nanother  imperial  election was held, with the war veteran and popular Grand Duke Vincen\n"the  Old  Owl"  Silmuna"  becoming  Emperor,  even despite the actions of Vincen's own\nsister  Riannón  years  prior  it  seems  the  petty  lords  of  Anbennar preferred an internal\nSilmuna  hegemony than a Lorentish one. The two factions eventually settled peace and the\nyoung Vincen was wed to Reán's daughter Eilís Siloriel.\n\nIn  1381  the  Lorentish  throne suffered a succession crisis, in which the current Lorentish\nqueen  Reánna  III  died without trueborn children, placing her aunt, Vincen's wife Eilís as\nheir  to  the  throne. With this claim and his backing as Emperor, Vincen declared war for\nthe  throne of Lorent in what turned into the longest portion of the Lilac Wars, the 20-year\nSecond Lilac War. The war ended with a truce as both sides grew weary.\n\nThe  Third  Lilac War began in 1400, 7 years after the previous war, with Vincen "the Old\nOwl"  pushing  his son Adénn's claim to the Lorentish throne and the war nearly came to a\nSilmuna victory until Vincen's death in 1421.\n\nThe  Fourth  Lilac  War  continued  right  after  Vincen's  death,  with  the Silmuna family\nforcing  a  stall  in  the  election process as Adénn Silmuna raced back home from the war.\nUpon  arriving  there, the night before the official elections, Adénn and his host were beset\nupon in the Battle of the Moon Council by hidden Lorentish forces and men under control\nof  the  Emperor-to-be,  Lothane  III  síl  Wex. Adénn and his forces survived and claimed\nvictory,  despite  the  losses  of  many  of  his  powerful  followers  and  own  children, and\nprepared for war against their former allies and Lorent."

 page_events.451.d: "\n\nA  region  of  Northwestern  Aelantir  populated  by  Fey  and  Season worshipping Eordan\nRuinborn  Elves.  It  is  centered  around  the Domandrod, an ancient and forbidden forest\npopulated  by  the  Fey, and around this axle the Eordan build civilizations like spokes on a\nwheel.  The Druidic magic taught to the Eordan after the Day of the Ashen Skies broke the\nEordan  into  five  cultures:  the Selpheregi who venerate Spring, the Caamas who venerate\nSummer,  the  Tuathak  who venerate Autumn, the Snecboth who venerate Winter, and the\nPeitar who strive to maintain balance and heed the orders of their Fey masters.\n\n==History==\n===Prehistory and the Day of Ashen Skies===\nOnce  a  backwater  during  the  days  of  the  Precursors,  this  land  was  sheltered  by the\nsoutheastern  mountains  from  the Day of Ashen Skies. The relative protection from initial\nblast  and  fallout  of the disaster allowed the survivors to flee to the Domandrod, an forest\nwilderness  more  of the Feyrealm than the Material Plane. During the Day of Ashen Skies,\nthe  Feyrealm  opened  into  the  proto-Domandrod woods, centered around a manor of an\neccentric  Precursor  elf collector and hobbyist scientist who collected a vast amount of Fey\ncreatures  and elements. These survivors were welcomed by the Fey who shaped them to be\nwilling  servants.  Here  the Eordand Ruinborn were created, moreso from the influence of\nthe  Fey  than  from  the  fallout  of  the  Day  of  Ashen  Skies. They were taught to live in\nharmony  with  nature  and how to access Druidic magics through upholding balance of the\nseasons.  However,  the  Fey became bored of acting as teachers over a few generations and\nevicted  the Eordan from the Domandrod, telling them that the outside is now safe and is a\ngift for them to start anew.\n\n===Resettling of Eordand and the Schism of Eordellon===\n\nEordand  was  settled by the fey-touched Eordan anew, for only very few survived outside of\nthe Domandrod. For centuries the lands were inhabited by semi-unified tribes who revered\nthe Fey and respected the seasons equally as they were taught under the Eordellon religion.\nThose  who  did  not  balance  the  seasons  or  rejected  the  Fey  were exiled to the south,\nbecoming  the  Fograc. However, over time the most talented of the Eordan druids learned\nthat  by focusing on one season they could channel far greater power, and that some regions\nof this land were attuned specifically to one season above all else."
 page_events.2026.t: "Eordand 2 / 4"
 page_events.2026.d: "\n\nThe  balance  of  the  seasons  upset,  the  Seasonal  Courts  of  Eordand  were created and\nEordellon  splintered.  This  schism  erupted  in  war  amongst  the heretics and against the\ninfuriated  loyal  Eordellon.  The  original  Pelodan Oathsworn swore an oath to the Fey to\nend  this  schism  and bring order the seasons, and united the newly forged Peitar tribe who\nwere  loyal  to  Eordellon  against  the  Seasonal  Courts. Pelodan Oathsworn saw repeated\nvictories  and  pushed  back  the  Seasonal  Courts  to their far-flung strongholds until they\nunited  against  him. Pelodan and the Peitar alliance were defeated by the Seasonalists near\nKairncal, and with the death of Pelodan the Peitar tribes were splintered forever.\n\n==Cultures==\nEordand is populated by five distinct Ruinborn cultures who disagree on the primacy of the\nseasons.  These  cultures  often  correspond  with  a Seasonal Court, such as the Selpheregi\nwith  the  Spring  Court,  but  even  after  conversion  to  another Court or Eordellon these\ncultures retain their physical traits and cultural values.\n\n=== Selpheregi ===\nThe  Selpheregi  uphold  the  season  of Spring as the most superior season. They reside on\nthe  western  coast  of  Eordand,  centered  around  the  ancient  rebuilt  Precursor  city  of\nArakeprun.  The  Selpheregi  are  the  most  inquisitive  and  creative  of the Eordan, being\nsurrounded  by  Precursor  ruins  that inspire them to discover the secrets of the past. They\noften  have  a  sense  of  superiority  towards  the  other  Eordan  because of the flourishing\nwonders  of  their  homeland.  The  season  of Spring gives them a natural aptitude towards\ngrowing  plant  life, as well as enabling them to grow flowering bushes on themselves. They\nhave  pinkish-white  or light green skin and vibrant hair the color of flowers, generally long\nand  flowing  unrestrained.  They  often  wear  extravagantly  dyed  silk  clothing and adorn\nthemselves with amber jewelry.\n\n=== Caamasi ===\nThe  Caamasi  uphold Summer as the primary season. They reside on the southern coast of\nEordand  along  the Sarmadfar and the Elarbarc seas. The Caamasi are renowned for being\nexpert traders and traders, and are naturally adventurous and charismatic. They ply the seas\naround  Eordand and beyond for new lands to discover and new people to make deals with,\nand  the  city-states  of  the  Sarmadfar  coast  use  these qualities to find an edge over their\nCaamasi and other Eordan rivals. The Caamasi are most tolerant of the Selpheregi, as they\nsee  the  season  of  Spring  as  just the introduction of the primary season of Summer. The\nCaamasi  have  orange or reddish skin reminiscent of the setting sun, and have short red or\nbrown  hair.  They are blessed by Summer's warmth, growing taller than other Eordan, and\nwear  short  and  loose  cotton  clothing  to  remain  comfortable  and  free  in  their warm\nhomeland."

They reside along the Milsgelp and\nthe  Randrunnse  seas,  with  the  former being their homeland and the latter a conquest by\ncrusades against the Snecboth. The Tuathak are a disciplined people, ever-preparing for the\nhardships  of  winter  and  war by gathering vast stores of supplies through organized labor.\nThey  hold  an  eternal  hatred  of  Winter  and  the  Snecboth  who worship it for the cold\nstarving months that arrive each year, resulting in the Boreal Crusades against the Snecboth\nas  both  revenge  and  a  means to end the Winter. They have bright autumnal leaf colored\nskin  in  oranges,  reds,  and  yellows  that  all change to brown in the winter. Their hair is\ntypically black, a stark contrast against their normally vibrant skin. The Tuathak often wear\narmor  or  clothing that might serve for war or survival, and prefer to wear bright autumnal\ncolored clothing.\n\n=== Snecboth ===\nThe  Snecboth  reside  in the harsh lands of the north where Winter is the strongest season.\nIn  order to survive they are primarily semi-nomadic, migrating across their lands to where\nis  best  suited for each month of the year. These migrations have incurred the wrath of the\nTuathak,  who  viewed  them  as  trespassers  during  their  migrations and have blamed the\nSnecboth for their hardships caused by Winter. The Snecboth maintain strong interfamilial\nand  inter-clan  relations,  and prefer to calmly discuss matters instead of rashly acting with\nviolence,  but  do  not  trust and easily help outsiders who have never helped the Snecboth.\nThey  have  very  pale  white  to  slightly blue skin, long black or white hair, and primarily\nblue  eyes. The cold winter forces the Snecboth to wear thick fur clothing for warmth, even\ndespite their resilience to the cold.\n\n=== Peitar ===\nThe  Peitar  maintain  the  balance of seasons of the Eordellon faith taught to them by their\nFey  Lords  in  the  Domandrod.  Scattered throughout Eordand, the Peitar ever struggle to\nend  the  seasonalist heresy of the other Eordan, by force if necessary. Over the centuries of\nstruggle and isolation from their seasonal cousins, the Peitar have grown bitter and zealous,\nready  to prove why they are the Chosen Servants of the Fey. The Peitar tribes tend to work\ntogether   unlike  the  seasonalists,  often  allying  and  working  together  in  war.  Due  to\nupholding  the balance of seasons, the Peitar are not as strikingly apparent as the rest of the\nEordan:  they have white to darker than skin, ginger to blond braided hair, commonly wear\nelaborate  warpaint,  often  have green eyes, and dress in green and brown clothing to blend\ninto the deep forest in both humble linen and fine silk."

The Grand\nDuchy  of  Esmaria  was  dissolved  during the Lilac Wars when the last Grand Duke died,\nand the various river lords, strung of their ties with the sìl Esmarainè, feuded for succession\nsupported  by  either  the  Emperor  or  the  Lorentish  King.

As goddess of the hunt, she is\nentrusted to hunt down the monstrous deities known as the Spawns of Agrados.\n\n== The Goddess ==\n\n=== Appearance ===\nFalah’s traditional depiction is that of an auburn-haired huntress, wearing a green cloak and\nwielding  a  bow  and  arrow. In the western parts of Cannor, in and around The Empire of\nAnbennar  Falah  is depicted as an elven woman. While more traditional areas like Gawed\nand  the  Reach depict her in her older human image. This divergence is usually accredited\nto  the  heavy  elvenization  of  southern Cannor, and the wish to appeal even further to the\nelven  followers  of the Regent Court. Regardless of her form, she is usually surrounded by\nnatural imagery, landscapes, wild game, and various arrows.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Kheteratan Founding Myth ===\nIn  the  Kheteratan myth, Elikhet arrives on the prime material to confront his siblings who\nhave  enslaved  humanity  and  falsely presented themselves as gods.

They claim that the\nhuntress  was  Queen  Aras III of Akalses and that she wasn't hunting alone. Instead, it was\nan  army  of  Bulwari  argonauts  composed of many kings, heroes, and their armies against\nNikšaru,  the  corrupted version of the Bulwari goddess that created the harpies, and one of\nthe Four Evil Beasts of Bulwar."

Another  major\ndivergence  is  that  Firanya  was  actually  fighting with the queen against Nikšaru. Firanya\nperished in the battle, and her queendom would collapse with her.\n\n=== Cannorian Creation Myth ===\nAccording  to  the  Cannorian  Creation  Myth,  Falah was created from the union between\nAgrados  and  Halanna,  where  Agrados  forced himself upon her. The result of this union\nwas  called  the  Spawns  of Agrados and would be the triggering point for the Godswar. As\nCastellos  defeated  Agrados,  he  granted  both  Falah  and  her brother Nerat a chance for\natonement  and penance for their unholy creation. Falah was tasked with hunting down her\nbestial  siblings,  and  it  was a task she gladly accepted. Of those siblings, she is accredited\nwith  hunting  and slaying Grilax, Vukar, and Siramod, with an avatar of Falah having slain\nFiranya.  It  is  said  that  Falah’s  failed  hunt  of  Firanya  was  the reason she created and\nmastered the bow, and why the bow is such a revered symbol within the clergy.\n\nThe  Temple  of  Falah  has  as such traditionally always been the protector of the rural and\nisolated  communities of Cannor and is sworn to protect them against all kinds of monsters\nand  beasts.  Believing  that  when  the  last  spawn  of  Agrados is killed, Falah may finally\nreceive her forgiveness and earn her proper place in the Regent Court.\n\nIt's  not  established  what  routes Falah's worship took across Bulwar, Sarhal, and Cannor\nacross  history  -  but  the  fact  that  the  Bulwari  and Old Castanorian word for “hunt” or\n"faya",  bears  a close resemblance to her name suggests that Falah could just be an ancient\ntitle meaning "Huntress".\n\n=== Castanorian Expansion ===\nDuring  the  peak  of  the  ancient  empire  of  Castanor,  Falah would be accepted into the\ncanon  of  the Castanorian Pantheon, an early version of the Regent Court. As local beliefs\nand traditions were supplemented by this new consolidated religion, many people of Alenor\nand The Reach would end up converting or being integrated into Falah worship."

Entire temples were left abandoned as many of\nthe  hunter  priests perished in the chaos, and those who returned did so heavily influenced\nby Corin.\n\nThose  who  had  stayed  behind maintained a traditional and narrower view of their duties,\nlimiting  themselves  only  to  the  traditional  spawns  of Agrados. Some even claimed that\nCorin herself was a spawn of Agrados, due to her connection with the fallen god.\n\n=== Modern History ===\nThe  Temples  of Falah have in modern times been hit the most by industrialization. Many\nof  their traditional ancient groves and places of worship in the Northern League have been\nleveled and desecrated in favor of the growing Halcann industrial economy.\n\nMany  of their former worshippers and followers have also moved on to the more proactive\nCorinite  Faith or the enlightened Ravelianism with Corinites having largely usurped Falah\nas the de facto rural religion. Comparatively, Falah worship is seen as archaic and outdated\nand their attempts at maintaining natural balance and halting overexploitation are seen with\na mix of pity and nuisance.\n\nFalah’s  traditional  role as protectors and guardians against the Spawns of Agrados has also\nbecome   increasingly   problematic   in  the  modern  day.  When  many  races  previously\nconsidered  "monsters"  joined  the  civilized  society. The dogmatic doctrine of Falah had\ntrouble  keeping  up,  and  some  extreme  cults  have  even committed acts of violence and\nmurder  in  the  name  of  Falah.

And many seasoned priests and hunters have started founding temples on\nthese unknown frontiers.\n\n== Relationships ==\nFalah is mostly isolated from the rest of the Gods and even her parents, and will remain so\nuntil  her  penance  has  been completed.

They  are  also  known to assist each other's hunts for Spawns of Agrados and the\nUndead  alike,  recognizing  the  greater  good  in ridding the world of Agrados lackeys and\ninfernal influence.\n\n== Religion ==\n\n=== Avatars ===\nDue  to  the  often  secluded  and  isolated  nature  of  the  temple of Falah, identifying her\navatars  has  always  been  a  challenge. It is assumed there have been many more avatars of\nFalah throughout history that have gone unnoticed by the Regent Court.\n\nA  theory  within  the temple is that Falah only sends her avatars for the most dangerous or\ndire hunts that need the power of an avatar to succeed. As their hunt is completed and their\nduty  is  fulfilled,  the  Avatar  has  sustained fatal wounds and dies shortly after. All of this\nwithout  the  Temples  ever  being  able  to notice. There are records of lone hunters found\ndead  near enormous and dangerous prey they shouldn't have been able to kill, lending this\ntheory some credibility among the clergy."

These  armories can be accessed by the faithful and sworn monster hunters, and\nunder  extraordinary  circumstances  they  might  even lend their considerable reserves to a\nzealous king's army.\n\n=== Priesthood ===\nBecoming  a  priest  of  Falah is open for all able and willing to learn how to hunt. How to\nharness  every  part  of  your  prey,  and how to respect each living creature. How to live in\nharmony  with  nature,  and ensure it can continue to thrive. And those willing to risk their\nlives  in  the battle against the Spawns of Agrados. Each priest must thusly master the art of\narchery or marksmanship, and how to make and maintain bows, arrows, bullets, and guns.\n\nPriests  are  often  clad  in  simple, ergonomic garbs dyed in natural earthy colors, with fur\nand  leather  also  being  prominent.  All priests incorporate a simple green cloak and most\ncarry knives or bows at all times."

Replanting  trees  after forest fires and in logging sites, putting out feed for\nwild  animals  during  winter, tending to sick or wounded animals, and keeping the balance\nof nature in check. The areas surrounding the Temples of Falah are considered a sanctuary,\nand  no  hunting  may take place nearby. This would later evolve into the concept of proper\nnational parks, most of which are dedicated to Falah.\n\nEven though temples and priests of Falah are most common in rural areas, or at the fringes\nof  civilization,  it is not unheard of for temples to operate in cities. There the priests often\nserve the same roles as their wilderness counterparts, managing public gardens, maintaining\nvermin  populations,  and  tending  to  pets  and  city animals. Often raising and caring for\nmessenger   pigeons.   They   also  serve  their  local  governance  councils  on  matters  of\noverexploitation,  maintaining  the  cities' natural balance and sustainability. Often arguing\nfor slow growth, careful city planning, and fewer excess luxuries.\n\nThe  priests  of  Falah  are  the first to be summoned when matters regarding the Spawns of\nAgrados  are  concerned  and  their  advice  and  experience are often carefully considered.\nThere are several fringe cults dedicated to only seeking out and destroying different types of\nSpawns, with varying levels of legitimacy granted by the temple.\n\n=== Followers ===\nFollowers  of Falah are encouraged to tend to nature in any way they can. Contrary to what\nmany  expect, both followers and priests of Falah see it as a duty also to treat and help sick\nor  injured  animals, and they can often be seen tending birds, deer, or other forest animals\nin their temples.\n\nThey  are also expected to hone their personal connection with nature through meditations,\nand  nature  walks,  or  hunts.  Learning  about  nature, plants, and herbal medicine is also\nhighly  encouraged  as  a  form  of  "hunting".  Most  Falah followers seek protection from\nvarious  monsters  or  are  looking  to  increase  their  fortunes while hunting, searching for\nsomething, or gathering."

 page_events.2036.d: "\n\nTypical  offerings  to  Falah  at her temples or altars include foraged berries and herbs, fine\ncuts  of  game  meat,  exotic hunting trophies, arrows, and ammunition. Followers can also\nleave  their  arrows  or  bows  at  their  temples,  or altars, and recite prayers of accuracy or\nprecision to have them strike true.\n\nThe  typical  follower  of  Falah  is  a  rural hunter, forest ranger, or army scout. But Falah\ncould  also  be  worshiped  by  a  city  butcher  wanting to respect their animals, loggers or\ncharcoal  burners  trying  to  maintain a natural balance, or a doctor using natural herbs for\nmedicine.  It  can  also  be  a  treasure  hunter  looking for loot, or a journalist hunting for\ninformation or a scoop.\n\n=== Rites ===\n\n==== Rite of the First Hunt ====\nThe  final  test  for  each  initiate  is the Rite of the First Hunt, where they aim to replicate\nFalah’s  first  hunt of Firanya. They must enter the wilderness alone with nothing but a bow\nand  knife,  and return with suitable prey. All while paying respect to nature and the rites of\nFalah.\n\n==== Solstice Feasts ====\nFollowers  of  Falah  also  celebrate  and  put  weight  on the changing of the seasons. Each\nsolstice  they  gather  their  followers for a grand celebration, where great tales of hunts and\nexploits are shared over roaring fires, roasting various types of meat, and foraged greens.\n\n==== The Grand Hunt ====\nOften  coincides  with  a Solstice Fest, to gather food for the celebration. A grand hunt is a\ncommunal  hunt,  where  all  hunters  work  as  one and collaborate as a single unit—often\nplacing  the  most  accurate  hunters  in stationary positions, while others drive prey toward\nthem.  The  hunted prey is often symbolic of different spawns of Agrados or other mythical\nbeasts, with birds serving as harpy symbols, wolves or foxes as gnolls, and so on."

Raheni sources report Harpies in the skies around\nNorthern  Rahen,  primarily  around  the  Serpentspine, and later Yan and Kai accounts say\nthat  they  were  first seen settling in Phokhao range and for a time were recorded to live in\nrelative  isolation.  Their  first  real encounters with Halessi humans, namely the Yan, were\nviolent.  Following  this,  numerous  reports  of  "winged  women" raiding and kidnapping\nappeared,  and  this  would  continue  for  about  a  century, until an unknown monk order\nattempted   to   strike   a   deal  with  the  harpies,  with  the  financial  support  of  several\nsurrounding villages.\n\nThe  Divergence of Feng Harpies form other Halessi Harpies began when the monks of the\norder,  who  were  capable  of  wind manipulation , successfully fended off harpy raids, and\nmade  their  way  up  the  Phokhao  until  they  were  finally  able to reach and speak to the\nmatriarch.  The  leader  of  the order, who was known for his love of spreading his fighting\nstyle  to  those  who  wanted  to  learn,  offered  to  teach  this  style  to the harpies, and in\nexchange  they  would  end  their raids and kidnappings. As part of the deal, the leader also\nrequested  that  the  harpies  descend from the mountains, and instead settle in his territory\nand become his disciples. The matriarch, aware of how exhausted her people were and how\neasily the monks had defeated them, accepted his offer.\n\nDuring  Harimar's  invasion  of  the  Xianjie,  many  orders  fought  in a disorganized front\nagainst  their  advance,  however  in  the end Harimar was able to subdue the human monk\norders.  The harpies were mostly spared, opting to defend in some of the deepest jungles of\nthe  Xianjie,  being  able  to  effectively  utilize  hit-and-run  tactics to force his forces out.\nFollowing  Harimar's  death,  a  harpy warrior rallied the remaining forces to drive out the\nremnants  of Harimar's army, earning the harpies a significant a far more significant role in\nthe  governance  and  rule  of  the  orders.  It  was  during  this that for the first time in the\nXianjie's history that a harpy rose to lead an order of monks."
 page_events.2037.t: "Feng Harpy 2 / 2"
 page_events.2037.d: "\n\nDuring   the  Second  Invasion  of  Xianjie  by  Jaher,  the  surrounding  villages  had  been\noccupied,  and  harpy  resistance  mainly  took  place  deep  within  the  jungle.  Sun Elven\ngarrisons  left  behind  to  defend  the  occupied territory would be constantly harassed and\nattacked  by  both  harpy  and  human  forces.  Following  the  ascension  of Jaerel and the\ncreation  of  the  Eastern  Phoenix Empire, the harpies quickly joined the numerous revolts\nthat  were  occurring,  striking  supply lines, and clashing with other orders who were more\nsympathetic  to  Jaerel.  The  jungles  and  surrounding villages were eventually completely\nliberated.  It  was  during  his  12  years of rule that harpies would be seen in a much more\npositive  light  among  the  other  orders,  as  they  were  the  ones  who  had  liberated and\ndefended  them.  During Jaerel's rule, the harpy leader of the order at the time also created\nan elite core of warrior monks whose purpose was to defend against any invader.\n\n=== Culture ===\nFeng  Harpies  primarily  follow  the  Righteous  Path, and prefer to reside deep within the\njungles  of  the  Xianjie.  They  were  described  as "spiritualistic and disciplined," and are\nknown  for  their  proficiency  with special staves that aid in their wind manipulation. They\ndress  in attire similar to a monk's robes, and are respected within the Xianjie for their role\nin  fighting  against  invaders.  They  also are known for hosting large dance festivals in the\njungle,  with  both  humans  and  harpies  partaking in a form of martial arts to dance. It is\nfrom  these festivals that they derive their name, "Feng." They were also known for being a\npopular destination for those seeking to study their technique and hone their martial skills.\n\n=== The Way of the Dancing Breeze ===\nThe  Way  of  the  Dancing  Breeze  was  utilized  by  the  Feng harpies, who combined the\nunknown monk orders unique fighting style and wind manipulation, with their sharp talons\nand  own  ability  to  fly.  Over  time  the  style gradually began to be more associated with\nharpies as opposed to its original human users. The style is notable for it's ability to deflect\nbullets,  as  well  as  being  greatly  respected  and  feared  due  to  the  Feng  harpies wind\nmanipulation  allowing  them  to  quickly move and dodge attacks alongside their ability to\nfly."

Indeed, a number of fey,\nsuch  as  Centaurs  and  Satyrs,  originate from Halann (more formally the Prime Material\nplane).  However, because these creatures came into being due to the strong influence from\nthe  Feyrealm,  they are still considered fey in nature. As such, fey is more of a constructed\nclassification than a real biological category.\n\n== Biology ==\n''See also: List of Fey''\n\nDue  to  the chaotic nature of the Feyrealm, combined with an abundance of life magic, fey\nare  well  known  to  take  every  shape  and form. Because of this, not all fey conform to a\n‘species’.  Quite  regularly  there are fey who are simply unique, born alone by the peculiar\nmagic  of  the  Feyrealm.  Yet, despite their unique origins, most fey have been observed to\nfollow  normal  life  cycles  not  unlike  those  of  the material plane. The exception to this\ncomes in the form of the seemingly ageless, though not immortal, archfey.\n\n=== Archfey ===\n''Main article: The Archfey''\n\nPowerful  beyond  most  any  mortal  reckoning,  the Archfey are a unique set of fey whose\norigin  is  shrouded  in  mystery.  It  is  believed that they were amongst the first fey to ever\narise,  as  all  other  fey,  sapient or not, seem to respect the Archfey. It is also possible this\nbehavior is simply due to the disparity in power between other fey and the Archfey.\n\n== Society ==\nWhile all sapient fey have their own unique cultures, they are all subject to the influence of\nthe  Archfey.  One  could  equate  this  to  how  the  great  powers  of  the  Prime Material\ninfluence   day  to  day  life  for  all  across  the  world.  However,  instead  having  distinct\ncountries,  the Archfey organize in the form of what the Wood Elves of the Deepwoods call\nthe  Fey  Courts.  The  most  powerful  of  these  courts  the  Seelie  and  Unseelie Courts,\nhowever other courts such as Eordand's Seasonal Courts are also of note."

Mischief and change are ideals held to the highest\nesteem as the Seelie Court believes this is how one can live life to the fullest. It is from the\nSeelie Court that the Fey reputation of troublemakers stems from.\n\n==== The Unseelie Court ====\nHeaded  by  the King of Darkness, the Unseelie Court is a dour place where resilience and\nwillpower  are  valued.  To  those  of  the  Unseelie  Court,  life is a struggle against death.\nThose who wish to live must prove themselves worthy at all times. Due to this attitude, the\nUnseelie  Court can be held responsible for the callous reputation often associated with the\nFey.\n\n==== The Seasonal Courts ====\nA  collection  of  four  courts  representing  the  four  season  of Spring, Summer, Fall, and\nWinter,  the  Seasonal  Courts  are  a  set  of  Fey  Courts  that  are loosely aligned in their\nopposition to the more dominant Seelie and Unseelie Courts.\n\n=== True Names and Given Names ==="
 page_events.2039.t: "Fey 3 / 3"
 page_events.2039.d: "\nCutting  across all fey cultures is the importance of one's own name. This is believed to be\nbecause  names  seem  to hold a special power over fey. The famous example of this comes\nfrom  story  of  the  goddess  Nathalyne  and how as a mortal she managed to take the satyr\narchfey  Dolumir's  power by learning his "true name." As such, no fey ever provides their\n"true  name"  to anyone but their closest friend or partner. Instead, when introduced, a fey\nprovides their "given name" or, in the case of the Archfey, their title.\n\n== Notes About The Fey ==\n\n=== Describing Fey and Fey Influences ===\nIt  is  a  well proven fact that the Feyrealm, and the Fey themselves, can profoundly change\nand  impact  other  creatures. Historically, however, superstition has lumped these changes\ninto  singular terms. To combat this and provide better clarity, feyologists have defined key\nterms to more accurately describe these changes and impacts.\n\n''Fey-marked''  (commonly,  negatively,  and  unscientifically referred to as ''fey-stolen'') -\nDescribing a person or creature that has been changed in some way by the Fey.\n\n''Fey-bound''  -  Describing  someone  who has made a pact with the Fey. Individuals who\nare fey-bound can be fey-formed, but not always.\n\n=== Addendums ===\n\n* While most all Fey are capable of travel between the Prime Material and Feyrealm, most\ndo  not.  One  can  liken  it  to  how  an  Escanni can walk to Rahen. Just because they can\ndoesn't mean there is reason or will to do so.\n*  The  Fey,  much  like other races, aren't a unified group. This is best exemplified by the\ndifferent  reactions  to  the  Burning of the World Tree. Some, like the Ashentree Fey, have\ndevoted themselves to vengeance. Others simply adapted to the changing world.\n* Like other cultures, the Fey have their own creation myths. But that is a story for another\ntime."

 page_events.482.d: "\nThe  Fey  Court  is  the  collected  rites  and  beliefs  often practiced by the denizens of the\nDeepwoods.  Not  a  religion in the classical sense, as the Fey are not considered divine or\nobjects  of  worship.  Rather,  it  is  a  collection  of  stories,  traditions,  rituals,  and rites\nemployed to avoid angering the Fey, or how to appease them.\n\n= History & Theory of Origin =\nThe  denizens  of  the  Deepwoods  had  to  constantly  be  mindful  of  the  Fey,  and their\nemotions.  Over  the  millennia  that  have  passed  since  the  burning of the world tree by\nCastan  Beastbane,  a complex system of rites, traditions, and rituals were developed by the\nwood  elven  cultures,  in  order  to  co-exist  with the courts. These are often supported by\nfolklore  or  stories  in  which  an  unwise  traveler fails to appease the fey and is subject to\nmisfortune.\n\nThe  Fey Court as such is an artificial term, meant to encompass all of those oral traditions\nand  rituals  practiced  by  Deepwoods  natives,  and  no  real central authority or oversight\nexists apart from local druids, ritualists, and fey-marked Pactseekers.\n\nA  very  common  misconception is that the Fey are malevolent or harmful. This is not the\ncase,  and  it usually stems from stories of their misdeeds. But in reality, the fey is just like\nany  other culture and should be approached as such, and the vilification done by stories or\npulp fiction media actively harms relations and conceptions of the fey.\n\n== The Courts ==\n\n=== The Seelie Court ===\nThe  Seelie  court  emphasizes  the  pursuit  of pleasure and enjoyment. They may be more\nopen  and expressive, valuing celebrations, festivities, and indulgences. The Seelie Court is\noften  associated  with  light,  life,  and  joy,  and  is  known  to  embody  a  way of life that\nemphasizes  pleasure  and joy as the primary aims of life. They are also seen as benevolent,\nkind,  and  protective  of  nature, and are often sought out by travelers and those in need of\ntheir help. It should be noted that the Seelie Court is not “good” by our standards, and can\nbe just as cruel and vicious as their Unseelie counterparts."

The Unseelie\nCourt  adheres  to embracing emotional detachment and self-control, as well as viewing the\nworld with a jaded and skeptical eye.\n\nThese  fey  are  often  seen  as darker and more unpredictable, with a reputation for playing\ntricks   and   causing  mischief.  However,  they  also  value  strength,  determination,  and\nperseverance,  and  may  view  those  who  anger  them as weak or unworthy. The Unseelie\nCourt  fey are also often obsessed with the idea of not being forgotten or fading away, which\ninfluences  their  actions  and  motivations.  This means that they might act in ways that are\nruthless  or  cruel, in order to secure their place in the memories of others and ensure their\nlegacy.\n\nTo  avoid  angering  the  Unseelie Court, it is important to be respectful, and cautious, and\navoid  making promises one cannot keep. If one does accidentally anger the Unseelie fey, it\nmay be necessary to make amends through a task or quest or to offer a sincere apology.\n\nPacts  with  the  Unseelie  Court  are not to be taken lightly, as they demand a great deal of\ndevotion  and  may  require one to make significant sacrifices.

 page_events.489.d: "\nThe  First  Cinder War was a conflict between the former Bulwari governors of the Jexisian\nEmpire  during  its  collapse. It started with a rebellion of Bulwari governors in 1161, just\nbefore the empress' death, and ended in 1169 with the death of Elizar and the defeat of the\nloyalist forces.\n==History==\n===Prelude===\nEmpress  Jexis’  paranoia  increased  toward  the  end  of  her reign, as her hold on Cannor\nweakened and the fight with Ioriel was seing no end. The action that confirmed the fears of\nmost  Elves  in  Bulwar  about her insanity was the execution of Gelmonias Dalzuir, an old\ngeneral  of  Jaher  and  governor  of the Upper Buranun who had quarrelled with Elizar for\nyears  because  of  the  latter's  ruthlessness.  Their  poor relation would lead to a defeat in\nWest  Dameria as they sent conflicting orders to the Legions. Although Elizar was the most\nblamed  for  the  defeat, Jexis sided with her brother against Gelmonias. As the old general\ntried  to  defend himself before Jexis, Elizar took the opportunity to kill his rival in front of\nthe  court  by  bashing  his skull on the floor below the Imperial throne. The only one who\nprotested  the  act  was  the  governor of Imulušes, Birzartan, who demanded to have Elizar\npunished  for  his  actions.  Jexis  refused  to  listen to her secretary, removed him from his\npositions and had him imprisoned.\n\nThe  news  of  the  murder  of  Gelmonias  and the imprisonment of Birzartan shocked the\nBulwari  governors.  Darastarion  Dalzuir  and  Eletar  Amarienzuir,  respectively  son and\nbrother  to  the  victims  of  Anbenncost, rose in rebellion. After condemning the act, Jexis\nhad  Filinar,  close  friend  and  advisor  of  Elizar, send to Bulwar with orders to bring the\ntraitors  to  Anbenncost for judgment. Thus began the Imulušes-Buranun rebellion or more\npopularly known, the Bashed Skull Urprising.\n\n===Conflict===\nFilinar  hoped  for  a  quick  victory after rallying his forces from his demesne in Kalib and\nmanaging  to  take  the  capital  of  the Buranun governor, but most of the them relucted to\ncommit forces beside the governors of Baharšes and Elizna. Darastarion retreated east after\nthe  loss  of  his  capital,  while  Eletar  harassed  the Jexisian forces in the Kuz mountains,\npreventing Baharsesi forces to link up with Filinar."

 page_events.2042.d: "\n\nThe  rebellion took a different turn after the Empress Jexis was assassinated in 1162. Most\ngovernors  rejected  her brother and would be emperor Elizar, especially after he embarked\non  a campaign of vengeance against his sister's suspected murderer, Ioriel. As the threat of\nElizar  faded  away,  several  governors  joined the rebels, notably in Ginerdu, Sareyand and\nYametšes.\n\nDespite  the  dire  situation  in  Bulwar,  Filinar  remained  loyal  to  Elizar. As the skilled\ngeneral  he  was,  he  managed  to  defeat  and  slay  the governor of Sareyand in battle near\nHarklum,  before  instructing  his  Eastern  allies  in Hašr and Azka-Sur to finish the rebels\naround  the  Naza.  He  then  embarked  on  a western campaign to provide a possible safe\nlanding  region  for  the  Legions stuck in Cannor. However, the brutality of Filinar during\nthe  capture  of the port city of Anzabad ended up sparking revolts against the empire in the\nnearby Medurubar and Brasan.\n\nFilinar's  army  suffered  his  first  defeat in Medurubar after a flood forced him to levy the\nsiege.  In the campaign of the Lower Suran, a low noble elf priest by the name of Taelarios\nappeared  as  a  capable  leader  of  the rebel faction. In the East, the Eastern loyalists were\nknocked  out  of the war following their defeat in Kutriq. In Cannor, Elizar was killed by a\nlone  Moon  Elf archer after managing to burn Ioriel alive, sparking uncertainty for Bulwar\nas  there  was  no  more  heirs of the Jaherian bloodline. With little hope of victory and no\nmore  cause  to  fight  for,  Filinar took his own life on the banks of the lower Suran in the\nsummer of 1169, ending the war.\n===Aftermath===\nAfter  the  war,  the  Phoenix  legions  that  followed Elizar in Cannor retreated to Bulwar.\nTheir  leader, Erelassa, demanded the bulwari governors meet with her in the city of Kalib.\nThere, she presented the bulwari governor an infant by the name of Jaddar, and proclaimed\nhim as the heir of Jexis. At her dismay, all rejected her claim outside of Vulzin, governor of\nElizna and fervent member of loyalists.\n"

 page_events.490.d: "\n\nThe  First  Lilac  War  was a military conflict that began in 1350 with the election of Reán\n"The  White  Fox" SiIoriel as Emperor of Anbennar and ended in 1376 with his death and\nthe  subsequent election of Vincen Silmuna as Emperor. The primary belligerents were the\nKingdom  of  Lorent  and  her  allied  duchies  with  the  Duchy  of  Pearlsedge against the\nmajority of the Empire of Anbennar led by the Grand Duchy of Dameria and the Duchy of\nIstralore.  It  was  the  starting conflict of the Lilac Wars that would come to end a century\nlater.\n\n== Prelude ==\nWith  the  death  of  Emperor  Tomás  síl Esmaraine in 1343, the electors of the Empire of\nAnbennar  gathered  in Anbenncóst once more. Duke-Elector Caylen II síl na Trisfer of the\nDuchy  of  Pearlsedge  led  a faction supporting Aucan Silmuna’s claim to the throne, while\nhis  rival  across the Damesneck, Duke-Elector Aucan III Silistra of the Duchy of Istralore\nled  the  faction  supporting  Riannón  Silmuna’s  claim  as  Empress,  disregarding her very\nyoung  age  and  instead  emphasizing the immense magical capability she had the potential\nfor.  Through backdoor political maneuvering, Duke-Elector Aucan III was successful, and\nshe was elected as Empress Riannón Silmuna.\n\nThe  next  five years of the Empress’s reign were marked by instability as the nobility of the\nEmpire  were  strongly  divided  over  whether she was a good choice for the imperial seat.\nRiannón’s  young  age,  combined  with the magical potential in her blood and her status as\nEmpress  created  a  very unstable mix of emotions that many believed would result in easy\nmanipulation or a return to the magocracy before the signing of the Treaty of Aranthíl. The\nvast  majority  who  were  unaligned with the House of Silmuna were incredibly cautious of\ntheir influence over the Empire and opposed that the most.\n\nEarly  one  morning  in 1348, a meeting of the electors ended with the decision to have the\nEmpress  abdicate  and  a  new,  more  experienced Emperor elected. The Empress threw a\ntantrum  upon  hearing  their  decision, and locked herself and some of her closest advisors\nand  bodyguards  into the throne room as the soldiers of the nobility lay siege to the palace.\nRioting  in  the  city  below  was  also  reaching  a  breaking point, as the small army of the\nnobles  aroused  hysteria  in  the  populace.  Fearing  for  her  life, Empress Riannón cast a\nmassive  spell  to  place the rioters into a trance and fight back against the nobles, of which\nshe  also  used  magic  against  to  prevent their unexpected entrance into the throne room.\nThis  came  to  a shattering conclusion when Ardan Silmuna, one of the bodyguards, killed\nthe Empress and her advisors in the throne room at the expense of his own life."

 page_events.2046.d: "\n\nThe  electors  found  themselves  unwilling  to  continue  with  their  original candidate for\nEmperor  following  the  event,  and  were  soon  divided again on a candidate. During this\ntime,  King  Reán  V  SiIoriel  of  Lorent,  nicknamed the White Fox, had been politicking\nbehind  the  scenes  to  get  himself elected as Emperor of Anbennar, and therefore solidify\nhimself   as   the   most  powerful  man  in  Cannor.  His  efforts  were  successful,  as  the\nDuke-Elector  of  Pearlsedge  was  convinced  by  the  White  Fox to whip enough votes to\nsuccessfully elect him as the new Emperor.\n\nImmediately  the  vast  majority  of  the nobility were in uproar over the elector’s decision.\nFrom  across  the realm, Dukes, Lords, Magisters even, all voiced their intense displeasure\nwith  the  new Emperor in both peaceful and violent means. Duke-Elector Aucan III began\nto  call  for  a  return  to  a  Silmuna  Emperor  and the overthrow of Emperor Reán, and it\nappeared  as though the majority of the Empire was in agreement. Reán knew this, and still\nmade it know that he wished to receive his coronation in Anbenncóst, as is tradition.\n\nHowever,  upon  setting  sail  from  the  deepest part of the Bay of Wines, he found himself\nblockaded  into  the Bay by a large fleet of ships bearing the Imperial standard. His attempt\nto  run the blockade in a smaller and lighter craft was met with failure as it was intercepted\nby  a  ship from the Duchy of Neckcliffe. He was forced to return to his procession fleet in\na  rowboat.  Over the course of the next year, multiple attempts to run the blockade during\nthe  night  and day, during storms and pleasant weather were also met with crushing failure,\nand  the  entire  incident  angered  Reán  to the extent that he began to plan a land invasion\nthrough  Pearlsedge  and  into  Neckcliffe  to  secure the Imperial Fleet’s primary operating\nport.\n\nSuch an invasion eventually occurred in 1350, two years after his election as Emperor. The\nLorentish  army,  commanded  by  King  Reán with General Vaceran síl Ionnidar providing\nmartial   advice,   began   their  march  to  the  border  of  Neckcliffe  near  the  capital  in\nBloomsdawn,  and  arrived  in  the  middle  of  Silversight with approximately 40 thousand\ninfantry,  cavalry,  and  minor  siege  equipment.

Due  to its ease of cooking, Kaages Bagu\nquickly  moved from simply being a funeral offering to a staple street food for commoners.\nFollowing  Menkaunswt's  occupation  in  335BA,  many  Bulwari  under  his  reign began\nincorporating  chickpeas into the dish's mix, later becoming inseparable even in Kheterata.\nRecords  from  the  11th  century  detail  Cannorian tomatoes as a paste and garlic vinegar\nsauce  being added though only available to nobles. Over time, even this would continue to\nspread  and  tomato  paste  and  the  garlic  vinegar  sauce  were  added  to  the dish by the\ncommon  street  merchant.  This  savory  dish  brought  with  it numerous variations, some\nstreet  merchants  using  Raheni  spices  to create a hotter dish whereas others sticking with\ntraditional Sarhaly yogurts and mints such as those from Irsmahap.\n\n===Salads===\n\n*Teleni  Peace Tea: One of the few teas consumed not only as a beverage or soup stock but\nas  a  salad,  Teleni peace tea is traditionally pickled in the same barrel as plantains to take\non  their  flavoring.

 page_events.501.d: "\nForest  goblins are an ethnic group of goblin predominantly seen in the Deepwoods and the\nFeyrealm.  Throughout  history,  they  have been mistaken as a diminutive fey creature and\ntreated  as  such.  It  was only until the Greentide when orcs and Common goblins invaded\nEscann  and  in turn the Deepwoods that forest goblins were identified as a long lost ethnic\ngroup  of  goblinkind.  Forest  goblins  share the trademark green skin seen in City goblins\nand Common goblins, but are known to exclusively have yellow or yellowy-green eyes.\n\n==History==\n===Origins===\nWhile  it  is  understood  than Goblinoids as a whole originated within the Prime Material\nPlane  deep  within  the  Serpentspine  Mountains,  it  is theorized that the ancestors of the\nforest  goblins  were  those  that  lived on the surface in and around Escann during the time\nwhen  the  Old  Deepwoods  spanned  much of the region. Due to the high incursion of fey\nmagic  and  creatures in ancient Escann, these goblins were understood by the human tribes\nto  be  fey themselves, and while modern historians reject their fey origins, the fact that the\nforest  goblins  exists  today as a fey-influenced race proves that these ancient goblins did in\nfact live and travel enough between the Deepwoods and the Feyrealm to be altered (as with\ntheir yellowy-green eyes).\n\nWhen  Castan  Beastbane  began his wars against the fey, he also burned down much of the\nOldwoods,  the  ancient  predecessor  of the Deepwoods and Greatwoods, and cleared it to\nsuch  an  extent  that  the  main  fragment of it exists today only in southern Escann - it was\nduring  this  event  that  many of the Forest goblins escaped into the Feyrealm proper along\nwith other races like the Satyrs and faded into obscurity and rare sightings.\n\n===Greentide===\nDuring  the  Greentide  many  orcs  invaded the Deepwoods along with their goblin slaves,\nclashing with the native fey and the realm of the Wood elves. The forest goblins during this\ntime  had  been  driven  to  the  darkest  corners  of  the  Deepwoods  and used the conflict\nbetween  elf  and orc to liberate their newfound brethren (the enslaved goblins that the orcs\nhad  brought).  By  Korgus  Dookanson's  death  in 1444 most of the common goblins had\nbeen  freed and joined the forest goblin clans, merging the two cultures, and pushed forth a\nnew era of aggression in an attempt to conquer the Deepwoods from elf, and now orc, once\nand for all."

For the city, see Viswall''\n\n\nThe  Free  City  of  Viswall  was  a  city-state  in  the  Small Country coterminous with the\nmetropolis of the same name.\n\n==History==\n===Origins===\nThe  free  city  had its origins in the Kingdom of Viswall, an electoral kingdom founded in\n1022 in the aftermath of the War of the Sorcerer-King as a state for the Hillfoot Halflings.\nFinnic  Shadowhand,  a  lowborn  warhero,  was  elected  as king. To legitimize his rule he\nwould  take  on  an  elvenized  surname,  founding the House síl Vis; while the city council\nwould  insist  on  continuing  the  ceremony  of  election,  in  practice  the  monarchy  was\ninherited as all future candidates would have to be chosen from the House síl Vis.\n\nThe  first  decade  of  the kingdom was spent riding the coattails of Finnic's prestige during\nthe  war  and  building up Viswall. Matters of state revolved between the King's Court and\nthe  councilors  of  the Viswall City Hall during these early years and would continue to do\nso  for the remainder of the kingdom. The ignorance of the rural provinces by the state left\nthe countryside grumbling, a situation which was taken advantage of by Lorent and Gawed,\nwho  eyed  the  fertile  lands  of  the  Small  Country  with  ambition.  Various secessionist\nrebellions  were  fomented  in  the kingdom with foreign support; when they succeeded, the\nnewly-freed states would come under the suzerainty of their sponsor.\n\nWith  the last hinterlands seized in the Fifth Tall War, the Viswall city council held a coup\nagainst  the  king.  Defeated,  the king and his family would remain political figureheads as\nthe council declared the creation of the Free City of Viswall.\n\n===The Free City===\nThe  Free  City  of  Viswall's  policy  was  one of permanent neutrality. Though it asserted\nopenness   to   the   outside   world,  it  would  remain  diplomatically  isolated  among  its\nneighbors:  relations  with  Gawed  and  Lorent remained cool over the lost lands, while its\nrivalry  with  Beepeck  simmered  as  the  latter  city's  prosperity  began to outpace that of\nViswall.  This  policy  remained  in  place  throughout  the  Interregnum,  resulting  in the\ncity-state's slow stagnation and decline."

The   population   boom   would   reinvigorate   the   city's   economy.   Halfling\nintelligentsia  from  both  Redfoot and Bluefoot land would be drawn to Viswall's image of\npermanent peace and safety across the Second and Third Lilac Wars, an image bolstered by\nthe  increased presence of the Rainbow Guard. Surrounded by symbols of Viswall's history\nsuch  as  the  Rainbow  Hall  and  the síl Vis king, a nascent halfling nationalist movement\nformed among the burghers and nobles of Viswall. These sentiments would spread through\nthe former Viswall Kingdom lands of Coppertown, Thomsbridge, and Greymill.\n\nThis would culminate in the Viswall Rebellion of 1421, in which King Callam síl Vis used\nhis  political  standing  to  rally  the  halflings of the Small Country to unify and overthrow\ntheir  oppressors.  However,  save  the  enthusiastic  Viswallers and their former provincial\ncompatriots, no others joined the call: Pearview and Appleton both remained loyal to their\noverlords  in Gawed and Lorent respectively; Beepeck would not support the ascendancy of\nits  rival;  and  the  halflings  of  Elkmarch, Bigwheat, Cowskeep, and Butterburn remained\nisolationist  in  their  affairs.  While Viswaller ambassadors made frantic attempts to make\nlast  minute  alliances,  Lorent  and  Gawed  put  aside  their  differences  to  put down the\nrebellion, ultimately besieging and sacking Viswall in 1423.\n\nThe  Free  City  of  Viswall  was  partitioned  into  North  Viswall and South Viswall. The\nremaining  síl  Vis  royals  and the contemporary city council would be deposed in favor of\noligarchs  loyal  to  Gawed  and Lorent, Though weakened and divided, Viswallers learned\ntheir  lesson  in  regards  to rebellion and would bide their time, spreading their agents and\nwaiting  for  the  perfect  moment  to  claim independence once more in the Small Country\nRebellion.\n\n\n"

The  council  heralded  the  standardization  and  centralization  of  religious\npractices across the Ynn.\n\nVelikvab  united  the  Sarda tradition of building barges to send deceased nobility down the\nriver  and  their myth of the End Flood together with the Dolindhan belief that they are the\nchosen people spared by a cataclysm for their virtue.\n\nIn Dolindha the rich previously practiced mound-burial.

The Gawedi, during their flight, took over the\nplains  of  the Alenic Frontier from the Wexonards in 470, pushing them south. They went\non  to  conquer  the  city  of  Vertesk from the Damerian Republic and formed the Gawedi\nKingdom  in  471.

These  defeats  pushed  the Gawedi out of Lencenor and stopped their influence for a\ntime.  Later,  when  they  found an opportunity, the Gawedi Kingdom pushed back into the\nregion.  After more wars came and went, the Gawedi Kingdom created a vassal, Eaglecrest,\nto hold the region for them. Eaglecrest at its height stretched to the western Lencenor coast\nbefore  that  coast  was  conquered in the Era of Black Ice by what became the Kingdom of\nReveria.\n\nDuring  the War of the Sorcerer-King, Black Castanor invaded the Gawedi Kingdom at the\nbehest  of  the Verteskers, wanting to be liberated.

Historians state that the\ntribal  confederation  rose  from various disparate peoples that were pushed to the northern\nfringes by their southern neighbours as well as gradual migration from the northern peoples\nof Gerudia over time.\n\nThe  Gawedi  peoples beyond the Alen were infamous for their hardiness and hostility even\namongst  the warring tribes of the Alenic Frontier, and proved as a major thorn to Castan's\nEmpire  for  much  of  their  existence,  even  being  the  principal opponents in Castan the\nQuareller's  campaigns into North Cannor - it is due to their existence that Castanor never\nproperly established a foothold in the Giant's Grave sea.\n\nThroughout  their  existence the Gawedi people were never fully conquered by the imperial\nforces  of  the  Damerian Republic and Castanor, a feat that many Gawedi people hold as a\nbadge of honour even to this day.\n\n===Dragonwake and establishment of the Gawedi Kingdom===\nDuring  the  Dragonwake  in  470  the  Gawedi  tribe,  united  by  Godrac (later known as\nGodrac  the Invader), crossed the Alen River into the lands of their southern neighbours in\nwhat  is  known  as  the Gawedi War of Aggression causing various tribes to flee south into\nthe  lands  of  the Damerian Republic, primarily the Three Tribes of Wexonards, Marrodic\nand   Crodamic  peoples,  and  by  471  forming  the  Gawedi  Kingdom  of  Vertesk  after\nconquering said city."

In 475 the first of the Gawedi migrations to Lencenor began in\nwhich  Gawedi  warlords fought against both local Lencori tribesmen as well as the Lencori\nEmpire,  a rump state of the recently collapsed Damerian Republic, which too collapsed in\n480 due to Gawedi attacks.\n\nThe  collapse  of  the Lencori Empire ushered in the period known as the Lencori Warlord\nPeriod,  in which many Gawedi chieftains and nobles settled and established themselves all\nacross  Lencenor.

Genies  have  been\nprevalent  in  various  culture's mythology and histories, marking them as one of the oldest\nraces  in  the  world,  similar  to  dragons.  Genie stories are usually around their ability to\ngrant wishes, often tricking their supplicants due to imprecise wording.\n\n==Physiology==\nGenie  appearance  varies  greatly  due  to  there being four different subraces, one for each\nelement.\n\n==History==\n===Origins===\nThe  origins of geniekind are as shrouded as their history, but most scholars agree that they\nwere created by their respective elemental primordial, making them one of the first races in\nHalann, older than even the elves or dragons.\n\nAccording  to the Cannorian Creation Myth, the genies were spared alongside the giants by\nthe  Clarionate  after  their  victory  in  the  Primordial  War,  in return for their aid in the\ncreation  of  the  world. Eventually, the genies were permitted to settle in their creation and\nnaturally  settled  in  areas  corresponding  to  their  elemental  affinity:  the air djinn lived\namongst  the skies and clouds, the water marids made cities under the seas, the dao roamed\nthe lands as nomads and the efreets made their homes within volcanoes.\n\nIn   the   Fangaula  creation  myth  the  Genie's  were  invaders  from  another  world  who\nmurdered  the  creator  god,  trapping his immortal soul at the edge of the world and ruling\nover  creation  as tyrants. Indirectly, the genies gave humanity free will and death, as before\nthe  Creator's  murder  all  the creatures of the world were unending and perfect, under the\ndirect control of God.\n\n===Djinn Rise and Fall===\nWhile  most  of  genie  history  is  muddled  due  to  geniekind's different view of time and\nspace,  a  common  part  of their shared history was what modern scholars call the Wars of\nDjinni  Hegemony  in which the djinn subrace defeated and expelled their brethren to their\nrespective  elemental  planes, and binding those too strong in objects like lamps. The djinn\nrace  then  settled  themselves  in the Salahadesi Desert and the Fangaula Savanna, creating\nwhat  was  known  as the Djinn Sultanates, which eventually enslaved the human peoples of\nthe region, most notably the Bulwari people of north east Sarhal and the Binwarji people of\nsouth  west  Sarhal. After this period, what happened to the djinni differs greatly depending\non who you ask."

This drove away many genies from the Savannah\nto  hidden  forgotten  palaces  lost  to  the  sands with only a few loyal human followers for\ncompany. When the first Fangaula empire fell hundreds of years later due to the Onslaught\nthe  golems  then  mysteriously disappeared, some claiming that the remaining genies freed\ntheir  imprisoned  brethren. Even after the fall of Fangaula the genies never returned to the\nSavannah, as they were fewer in number due to Aro's rebellion and fearful of being trapped\ninto  golems  again.  This lead to the Savannah being ruled by planetouched warlords, with\ntheir  non  planetouched  heirs  being  usurped  by  other ambitious planetouched, until the\nBiakata invasion.\n\nIn  the  Bulwar account, after aeons of servitude the Bulwari people were liberated with the\nhelp  of  the  djinn  Brasan  the  Emancipator,  who  taught  the  Bulwari peoples the art of\ngenie-binding.

It  is  assumed  that  they  were  simply banished back to the\nElemental  Planes as a side effect of the magical blast that caused the Ruin of Aelantir. For\nsome  unexplained  reason  genies  have  not  returned  to  our plane in great numbers ever\nsince,  and  the  only  recorded  interactions  with  genies have been the wish-granting kind\nimprisoned by those in magical lamps and rings."

Not much is known about his early life, apart\nfrom the fact that at some point he married and had a son.\n\n==Adventuring Career==\nAfter  his  wife  and  son  were  slain by an Orcish raiding party, Gerin swore to avenge the\ndeath  of  his  family,  and  became an adventurer. Over the years, he fought against several\norcish  skirmishes and raiding parties near the slopes of the Serpentspine and the caves past\nKhugdihr,  becoming famous as Escann's premiere orc-slayer. This fame led to Fognir Asra\nrecruiting  him  to  his  expedition  into  Ovdal  Asra, which he agreed to after hearing that\nDugorik  Dragonbreaker,  the orc that had killed his wife and son, had become the warlord\nof  the  orcs  gathered  in the abandoned hold. In the winter of 1410, he and the rest of the\nexpedition party went into the Dwarovar.\n\nDuring  the  expedition,  Gerin  fought hundreds of orcs in order to confront Dugorik, and\neventually  slew  him  in  personal combat. Gerin was eventually brought down by the orcs\nand  believed  dead  by  the  rest  of  the party. Unbeknownst to them, Gerin had survived,\nwaking  to  hundreds  of  orcs  dead  by his hand, and Mintbrick dead next to him. Furious\nover  the  death  of  his  friend  and  with no other goal in life after Dugorik's death, Gerin\nventured  deeper  into  the  Dwarovar  to  kill  and  hunt  down  as  many orcs as he could,\nswearing that he'd purge the Dwarovar of orcs.\n\n== Time in the Dwarovar ==\nOver the next two decades, Gerin would slay countless amount of orcs, becoming feared by\nthem  as the Trickster: a shadow in the night, whose traps and ambushes were as important\nto   his  deadliness  as  his  proficiency  with  the  sword.  Gerin  destroyed  several  orcish\nsettlements  by  himself,  and  even  ambushed  an  orcish horde led by Korgus Dookanson\nhimself  during  their  march  towards  Khugdihr,  killing as many as he could before being\nforced  to flee to the caverns by the orcs. He continued to follow Dookanson's horde to the\ngates  of  Khugdihr,  harassing  and  ambushing  them  whenever  he  could,  but  broke his\nsword-arm  while  fighting  a party of orcs, forcing him to sit and watch as the forces under\nGurukk Siegebreaker's lead overran Khugdihr."

Falsely believing that the White Walls of Castanor would be able to\nhold  the  Greentide  back  and the orcs would be butchered on the fields of Escann, Gerin\nhad  decided  to  return  back  to  the  Dwarovar  to  continue his fight against the orcs and\nseeing  Dwarovar  restored,  and offered the surviving dwarves to join him. Only one of the\nsurvivors,  a  dwarf  named  Dagrin,  took  up  Gerin's  offer,  the  rest opting to take their\nchances in war-torn Escann.\n\nOver  the  course  of their adventures across the Western Serpentspine, Gerin learned from\nDagrin   how   to  speak  the  Dwarven  language,  and  found  the  Sapphire  Gem  of  the\nDwarovkron  while  exploring  the  region.  During  their  travels,  the  duo  came across a\ndwarven  camp,  consisting  of  people  from  dwarven  communities  that  had  survived in\nisolated  parts  of  the  Dwarovar,  who  had  who  had  banded together following the orcs'\ndepartment  from  West Dwarovar. Gerin and Dagrin were set on the idea to find an intact\ndwarven hold which led the dwarves of the band informing them about Ovdal Lodhum, the\nhome  of  some  of  the  dwarves, giving the two an objective to head to and convincing the\nband to venture with them.\n\nDuring  the  journey, Gerin met a married dwarven woman named Dwalra which he took a\nliking  to,  however  the expedition had encountered an orcish assault which Gerin failed to\nhold off, resulting in Dwalra's husband's death. Devastated by the loss of her husband, and\nleaving  her  son  Balgar  fatherless,  Gerin  took responsibility for her husband's death and\nvowed  to  take  care  of  them.  Dwalra  and  Gerin  ended up falling in love, and later got\nmarried, with Gerin adopting Balgar as his own son.\n\n==King of Ovdal Lodhum==\nAfter  marrying  Dwalra,  Orcrend returned with the dwarven band to his new wife's home,\nthe  Hold  of  Ovdal  Lodhum.  Following the death of the hold's previous King four years\nprior,  the  hold's  assembly  had  been divided on the election of the new King. Due to his\npossession  of  a  gem  of the Dwarovkron, the sword that gave him the name Orcrend, and\nhis  vision  of  the  reclamation of Dwarovar resonating with the members of the Assembly,\nGerin was soon elected to the position of King in 1430."

Technological innovations from the surface and Khugdihr\nwere  introduced,  and  dwarves  from  remote,  hidden  villages  started to enter the hold's\ngates.  Gerin's  experience  against orcs also led to Ovdal Lodhum adopting a new military\ndoctrine,  focused  on  quickly  securing  new lands before the enemy could react instead of\nwaiting  in  a  defensive  position  for the enemy to take the initiative.

As the war raged on several centaur clans took the opportunity to offer\ntheir  service  to  Roghrin, assisting him in reestablishing his father’s realm. With Roghrin’s\nvictory  and  the  power of his authority clear, the centaurs that assisted him were rewarded\nwith iron weaponry and armor. This was the start of the long tributary relationship between\nMaghargma  and  the  centaurs,  where  the centaurs brought slaves, food, and praise to the\nogres  in  return  for  boons  of  iron  and  steel.  The  ogres  that  continued  to  refuse the\nMengurkha’s rule fled to the forests north of his sprawling realm.\n*Dragonwake 470 AA - 500 AA\n**With  Elkaesal  the White freezing the north during the Era of Frost, the remaining ogres\nof  the  northern  pass migrated into the Serpent’s Vale, fighting through goblins and orcs to\nestablish  themselves  in  the  swamplands.  They  scattered  into hundreds of isolated clans\nlargely  focused  in the southern end of the vale, stubbornly holding their bogs against those\naround them and ultimately becoming the Mossmouth Ogres.²\n*Beralic Saga 882 AA\n**With  the  rise  of  the  Kingdom  of Bjarnrik and the death of Urgnak the Foul at Bera’s\nhands, the trolls were pushed to the far northern mountains and forests of Gerudia.\n*Rise of Shrakk 1430 AA\n**With  many of the goblins and orcs gone from the Serpentspine due to the Greentide, the\nChief  of  the  Mire  Maw  Clan,  a  powerful  warlord  known  as  Shrakk,  conquered his\nsurrounding rivals, becoming the supreme ruler of the Mossmouth Ogres.\n*Resurgence of Maghargma 1438 AA\n**Weakened  by  centuries  of decadence, the Fathide Ogres had fallen into a false sense of\nsecurity;  the  Mengurkha  had  for centuries lounged in their palace gorging themselves on\nfeasts  provided  by  centaur  tributes.  While  this  had  been  happening  the  warlords  of\nMaghargma  had  largely  stopped  recognizing  royal authority, paying the crown lip service\ninstead of tithes and raiding each other for loot and flesh. This decadence was broken when\nthe centaurs suddenly attacked the realm. Mengurkha Borigg Gravelhide begrudgingly rose\nfrom  his  throne  to  repel the centaurs, believing that it would be a simple matter. He was\nquickly   proven  wrong  as  he  was  slain  in  battle.  His  successor,  Ziltagh,  had  grown\ndisdainful  of  the  decadence,  eager to reassert control and expand his realm. Now that he\nhad  become  the  Mengurkha  he rallied his disobedient warlords and soundly defeated the\ncentaurs,  quickly earning the respect and loyalty of his vassals as he began the long process\nof reunifying his domain and expanding its borders to obtain new subjects and tribute."

Gnolls\nare  primarily  found  in  the  Salahad,  but  populations  can  be  found  across Sarhal, and\ndisparate  smaller groups are notable in Bulwar and southern Cannor. According to Regent\nCourt  mythology,  the  Gnolls  are  a  Spawn  of  Agrados,  and  are  descended from their\nprogenitor  Grilax. The Gnolls are known to worship demons and their societies tend to be\ncharacterized by infighting and siblicide, which many Cannorian scholars trace back to this\ninfernal  heritage,  though rival schools of thought point to similar behavior in the common\nhyena as a likelier origin.\n\n== History ==\nDescription  and interactions with gnolls have been prevalent throughout early history, with\nmany  human  tribes  in  Sarhal and the Salahad recording interactions with the savage race\nsince  the  beginning  of  their  civilizations.  It  was  only  in  1152 BA that gnolls entered\nprominence  when  the  gnoll Krah led his pack up the Mother's Sorrow to Kheterata upon\nhearing  of  their  weakness  during  The  Onslaught, where he raided weak settlements and\nbecame  the  first  slaver: he would later gain many riches enslaving the poor and selling to\nthe  rich  across  Kheterata  and Bulwar - and soon other gnolls came to ply the burgeoning\nslave trade in those lands, often bringing enslaved humans from Sarhal.\n\n=== Mythological and Demonic Origins? ===\nIn  Regent  Court  mythology  it  is  said  that gnolls were a part of the Spawns of Agrados,\nbestial  races  emerging  from the rape of their earth goddess Halanna. It is said that gnolls\ncame  from the infernal plane of Hell from the domain known as the Pits of Grilax (named\nafter their god, Grilax) that is somewhere in the Salahadesi Desert. While this location has\nnever  been  found  or confirmed, it is said that Castan Beastbane led his legions in a futile\nattempt  to  invade  and  destroy  the  Pits  of Grilax but no survivor ever returned from his\ncampaign to confirm its success.\n\nContemporary  scholars  refuted this idea, and suggested that any sort of demonic influence\non  the  gnollish  race  started  in the year 666 BA which saw the rise of the Xhazobine, the\ndemonic-chosen champion of the gnoll peoples. However, since the rediscovery of Aelantir\na precursor text dating to 27,500 BA was found describing creatures coming from 'a Mouth\nof  Fire,  where  thousands  emerge, and drag captured natives into its maw' which suggests\nthat  the  origin  from  the  Regent  Courth myth may hold some truth, and that perhaps the\nXhazobine was a revival of said practices."

Some speculate this inclinations is from their demonic origins, while others believe\nit's  due  to  their  relationship  with hyenas, but almost all scholars recognize its existence.\nFor many gnolls, slavery has certain aspects of both forced adoption and animal husbandry,\nwith  slaves  valued  below  other  gnolls  but  significantly above something like a sheep or\ngoat; valued parts of the family, but not very high-ranking members of it.\n\nImportantly,  while  some  gnolls  rank  higher  or  lower  than  others,  the enslavement of\nanother  gnoll  is  looked down upon as both betrayal of the race and effectively useless due\nto  gnolls making for particularly surly and unmotivated slaves; many would rather die than\nperform  manual  labor  for  the  benefit  of someone else, so as an alternative a practice of\nforced  adoption  into  the  winning  pack  is practiced when one group of gnolls subjugates\nanother.\n\nIn  addition  to the forced adoption of losing gnolls into the victorious pack, those killed in\nbattle  are  often  cannibalized  -  how  ritualistic  this  is  differs  by pack, with those more\naligned  to  the  Xhazobkult  consuming the dead on the battlefield itself while others packs\ntend  to  be  more  respectful. This cannibalization is thought of in terms of consuming the\nstrength  of the slain, combined with a broad sentiment that not eating what you've killed is\ndisrespectful.\n\n==Notable Members==\nGrilaxXhazobineKrah\n\n\n\n"

Gnomes   notably   have   large,\nlightly-pointed  ears  unlike the smaller, rounded ears of halflings. They also lack the large\nfurred feet of the other race, preferring to walk in shoes and boots instead of barefoot.\n\nGnomish  skin  color  tends  toward  fair  to  pale,  the latter more commonly found in the\nfrequently-overcast  islands  of  the  Dragon  Coast.

The\nhistory  of  the  Cannorian  halflings  and the gnomes diverged when the gnomish ancestors\nsettled on the damestear-laden archipelago of the Splinters.

These nomadic and pastoral\nHill Gnomes would not descend into the lowlands until around 1200 BA, pushing halflings\nout  of  the  Dragondowns  and  forming  city-states around the Oddanroy River. A century\nlater  the city-state of Royvibobb united the gnomes, forming the Gnomish Hierarchy. This\nstate  was  known  as  one  of  the  great powers of ancient Cannor alongside the Damerian\nRepublic  and  the Empire of Castanor, with gnomes spreading south and east alongside the\nHierachy's   borders  into  the  Small  Country  and  Lencenor.

An  offshoot  population  in  Bulwar,  the  Delta\nGnomes,  originated  from a Hierarchy delegation to the Kingdom of Kheterata during this\nperiod.\n\nHowever,  in  the  year  400 the Dragonwake saw Tayekan the Blue arise with a great storm\nover the Dragon Coast, followed by millions of kobolds pouring from the Dragondepths to\nswarm  the gnomish homeland. Almost all gnomish administrators and soldiers were called\nback from across the Hierarchy to defend their homeland, leaving their Lencori human and\nhalfling  subjects  to  rule  themselves.  In  spite of their efforts, they would only be able to\nsecure  the  lands  south  of  the  Gnomish  Pass,  resulting  in  most  gnomes fleeing to the\nbackwater  islands of Nimscodd and the Storm Isles, proclaiming the Nimscodd Hierarchy\nas a successor state. The unaffected provinces of Norroy and Ronroy also received refugees\nin  the  city of Portnamm, which would come under the rule of the Kingdom of Iochand. A\nfew would go further: some into their former subject cities like Viswall and Beepeck, while\nDameria gifted the lands of Giberd to refugees in exchange for their artificing secrets.\n\nDivided, the gnomish people split in custom as well: the traumatized settlers who remained\non  Nimscodd  and  the  isles  assimilated  into  the  dour  native Cliff Gnome culture; the\npeople  of  Iochand  adopted Cannorian religion and courtly customs to become the cheery\nCreek  Gnomes;  and  those who accepted Dameria's sanctuary became influenced by their\nneighbors  as  well,  becoming  the  Imperial  Gnomes.  Though  greatly diminished, these\nrealms  would remain largely stable over the years, barring the collapse of Iochand in 1264\nwhich  left  Portnamm  a  free city. Gnomes would only come to resettle the Gnomish Pass\nunder  Nimscodd  in  1396.

While they carried on the torch of the Hierarchy's\nlegacy,  the  gnomes  of  Nimscodd  in  particular  grew  isolationist;  Iochand  had to raise\nhuman  and  halfling  nobles  as  nominally  equal  to  gnomes;  and  those  of  Giberd and\nKoroshesh   subjected   themselves   to   human   overlords,   using   their  technology  and\nintelligence to act as advisors.

 page_events.553.d: "\nThe  Gnomish  Hierarchy  was  a  major  power in Cannor during much of the ancient and\nearly  medieval  period (1147 BA - 470 AA). It consisted of gnomish and halfling peoples.\nIt  was destroyed during the Dragonwake, but eventually re-established by revanchists from\nthe Nimscodd Hierarchy.\n\n==History==\n===Pre-History===\nThe   gnomes   were   originally   a   semi-nomadic   people   living   in   the   hills  of  the\nDragonheights, safely away from the tribes of Cannor. The gnomes were an isolated people\nand  had  little  trust  of  outsiders.  They  held  especial  disdain  with  their less-civillized\ncousins,  the halflings, whom the gnomes claimed pushed their ancestors off the fertile land\nand into the mountains.\n\nOver  time,  the  gnomes  regained  their  confidence  and  migrated down to the lowlands,\nsettling  on  arable  plains.  The  new  agricultural  power, combined with an abundance of\nwood  and  untapped  fish  made  the  lowland  settlements  very  rich. The majority of the\ngnomes eventually migrated to the lowlands, transitioning from decentralized hill-people to\nan urban civilization centered around a palace economy.\n\n===Age of Beasts===\nIn  1127 BA, the Gnomish Lowlands was divided between many bickering city-states, most\nof  them  dotted  around  the  Oddanroy  River. During this time the city-states funded the\ncreation  of  Royvibobb,  a  fort  tasked with guarding the gnomish borders to the east. Any\ninvaders would have to go through Royvibobb or face a war of attrition in the hills.\n\nIn  Autumn 1127, a large group of human & halfling marauders broke through Royvibobb\nand  the  Gnomish  Pass.  The  raiders  laid  waste  to to the region, pillaging and burning.\nUnbeknownst  to  the  city-states,  this  was  masterminded  by  the  rulers of Royvibobb to\nweaken  the  city-states  and  unify  the  gnomish people. With the help of the raiders (who\nwere  brought  in  with  a  promise  of  riches  and tribute from the new government, not to\nmention  an  open  gateway  into  the  Lowlands),  the  city-states'  armies  were destroyed.\nRoyvibobb  annexed  the  entire  Lowlands  and  announced  the formation of the Gnomish\nHierarchy."

 page_events.2077.d: "\n\nAs  for  the  barbarian  invaders,  they  were met with a full-strength Royvibobbian army as\nthey  tried to return to their homelands. They were promptly killed or enslaved. Historians\nhave called this turn of events "deviously gnomish".\n\n===Early Castanorian Period===\nWith   a  unified  gnomish  state,  the  Hierarchy  gradually  expanded  its  rule  across  the\nDragonheights  and  became a major center of trade in the ancient world. It exported gems\nand metals to local tribes as well as the Early Castan's Empire and Kheterata.\n\nIn  this  period,  the  Hierarchy  aided  Castanor's  attempt  to  colonize  the  shores of the\nDameshead.  Gnomes  aided in the founding of Vertesk and Damenath, and helped protect\nthe region against barbarian incursions.\n\nCastanor   and   the   Hierarchy  partitioned  Western  Cannor  amongst  themselves.  The\nHierarchy  subjugated  various  human  and  halfling  tribee,  and  also  founded the city of\nBeepeck.  With  the  fertile  lands  of  the Small Province under their control, along with a\nhalfling  workforce  who  had  farmed  the  area since antiquity, the Hierarchy underwent a\npopulation boom.\n\n===Greater Castanorian Period===\nThis  period  saw  the Hierarchy at its height of wealth and power. Relations with Castanor\nturned  sour,  and  the  Hierarchy  supported  the  Damerian  Republic  in  the  War of the\nCerulean  League. For the Republic's early years, the Hierarchy was its staunch ally, seeing\nit as a buffer state and balance against Castanor.\n\nThis  alliance  was  short-lived,  however,  and for much of the period the Hierarchy would\nsee  itself  at  war  with  both  the  Damerian  Republic  and  Greater  Castan's Empire for\ndominance of the continent.\n"

 page_events.2078.d: "\n===Dragonwake and the Kobold Rising===\nIn  470  AA,  the  Kobold  Rising  saw  countless  kobolds  emerge  from  the depths of the\nDragonheights  and  attack the Gnomish Hierarchy. Kobold victories caused the Hierarchy\nto  focus  its  military  attention  on  the  heartland of the Dragondowns. This left its newer\nholdings  in the Small Country and Beepeck victim to countless raids, as well as settlement\nby barbarian migrants fleeing westwards.\n\nThe Kobold Rising saw many gnomes enslaved, as well as the sack and destruction of many\ngnomish   cities,  including  Oddansbay.  After  the  Rising,  the  Gnomish  Hierarchy  was\nreduced  to  the  island  of Nimscodd. Its mainland territory was settled by various kobolds\nand barbarian migrants.\n\n===Legacy===\nThe shattered Hierarchy was succeeded by its fleeing remnants which eventually formed the\nPortnamm,  Giberd, and Nimscodd hierarchies. During that period, over half the gnomish\npopulation  was  displaced and scattered throughout Cannor. The gnomes mostly settled in\nthe  aforementioned  successor  states,  but  others  went  to  Lorent or major cities such as\nAnbenncóst and Beepeck.\n\nDespite  the  gnomes'  misfortune,  many  continued  to  dream  of  retaking of the Dragon\nCoast.  Giberd  was  known  to  offer aid to those wishing to retake the region, and various\nothers  peoples  of Cannor were also sympathetic to the gnomish cause. However it was the\nislanders  of  Nimscodd  who  eventually  wrested  the  coast  from the kobold tribes. They\ntriumphantly reestablished the Gnomish Hierarchy as a technocratic state.\n\nAnother  successor  to  the  Hierarchy  was the Small Kingdom, a halfling-ruled rump state\ncomprised of part of the Small Province. The Kingdom received many gnomish refugees in\nits   cities.   They  excelled  in  jewelmaking  and  craftsmanship,  which  would  form  the\neconomic  backbone  of  the  country  before its invasion and partition. The Small Country\nrevolt would take inspiration from the Kingdom in the establishing of their republic."

 page_events.554.t: "Goblin 1 / 6"
 page_events.554.d: "\nGoblins are a short and numerous race of goblinoid. They are said to originate beneath the\nSerpentspine  Mountains,  traditionally  living  in  caverns and tunnels there. Goblins have\nlong been the enemy of dwarves and have long infested the mountains, and have come to be\nknown  as  exceptionally  crafty  in their plots and schemes. By the 18th century goblins in\nthe  surface  became  known  for  their  explosive brand of artificery and cutthroat business\nexpertise.\n\n== History ==\n=== Origins ===\nGoblins  are  said  to have originated in the dark caves of the Serpentspine Mountains, and\nsome claim they were the original inhabitants of the mountains, not the dwarves.\n\nGoblins were the primary enemy of dwarfkind for much of dwarven existence, and attacked\nthe   dwarves   as  they  carved  great  holds  and  roads  throughout  their  history.  Goblin\nincursions were a major factor in the long decay of dwarven civilization, in what was known\nas  the  Last  Days  of  Dwarovar,  but  it was only until the appearance of orcs did a united\ndwarven Dwarovar fall.\n\n=== Recent History ===\nLike  orcs,  goblins  were  once uncommon on the surface, only seen in infrequent raids on\nsettlements that border the Serpentspine as well as the Deepwoods, where the forest goblins\nwere  often  mistaken  for  fey.  This  changed  in  1424  during  the  Greentide, when orcs\ninvaded Escann, bringing their goblin slaves in tow.\n\nGoblins  also  attacked the surface years prior in the Decades of Devastation, when goblins\nswarmed across Bahar in Bulwar to flee from the Greentide's leader, Korgus Dookanson as\nhe fought to unify the western Serpentspine before the Greentide.\n\nWith  the  death of Korgus Dookanson in 1444, many goblins broke free from their orcish\nmasters and started their own clans in the surface of Escann."
 page_events.2080.t: "Goblin 2 / 6"
 page_events.2080.d: "\n\n=== Adapting to the Surface ===\nThe  end  of the Greentide saw many goblins living in ghettos and slums across the cities of\nEscann,  and  eventually  became  a  critical  part  of  the  lower income parts of prominent\nhuman cities.\n\nIn  one  case  many  goblin migrants flocked to the city of Bayvic which had oddly accepted\nthem  with  open arms, and by the 17th century the city became a goblin-majority city with\ngoblin  innovations  reviving  the  city  and  making it an industrial powerhouse in Cannor.\nThis  new  wave  of goblin success in Cannorian society led to a new subculture and type of\ngoblin  called  the  City  goblin:  one  that  became  known  for  ingenuity in artificery and\ncutthroat business acumen.\n\n==Appearance and Biology==\nGoblins  are  recognizable  for  their  large  sometimes-to-the-point-of-drooping ears, large\nbeak-like  noses and large mouths capable of the most mischievous of grins. Goblins come\nin  various  skin  colours  depending  on  their  environment  -  with  prolonged  settlement\nresulting  in skin hue shifts over generations: an example of this is cave goblins, who due to\nthe darkness and stone of the Serpentspine, usually have skin tones ranging in the shades of\nblack  and  gray  -  on the other hand goblins in the surface have developed the iconic green\nskin of Greentide fame.\n\nAfter  Korgus  Dookanson's death, the goblin's orcish cousins lost their accelerated variant\nof the goblin skin-changing ability, though goblins retained their much slower variant.\n\n=== Tusor Growth Gene ===\nThe  goblin  scholar  Tusor  claims  that  the  goblin's  diminutive nature was in fact due to\nevolutionary  changes attributed to the long-term neglect and malnourishment of the goblin\nrace,  which  had  often  been  enslaved  or  killed by their neighbours in the Serpentspine.\nTusor  states  that  the  original  goblins,  the  Tusoric Goblin, was said to resemble a "less\nhairy  hobgoblin"  and  stood  at  the  shorter  end  of  a  human's  average height. He also\nsuggests  that  other  goblinoid  races,  like  bugbears  and  hobgoblins  were  the successful\nevolutionary  variants  of  the  common  goblin:  those that, in pre-history, had ''won'' and\n''dominated''  their  local  environments,  and  was  able  to  procure  food and supplies to\nmaintain or even, in the case of bugbears, expand their height."
 page_events.2081.t: "Goblin 3 / 6"
 page_events.2081.d: "\n\nHe  attributes this idea of exponential growth to the Tusor Growth Gene, which he says has\nsince  become  repressed part of the bugbear and hobgoblin genome. For goblins, however,\na  small  percentage  of the population have an active growth gene which can allow them to\ngrow to the height of the tallest dwarf at 5 feet if well-fed during the key development stage\nof  childhood.  Indeed,  some  cases  of  a  mutated  growth gene also exist, which not only\nallowed exponential growth in height but also in weight, such as in the wealthy industrialist\nSrobnak the Large, which grew to morbid obesity of 300lbs and a sitting height of 7 feet!\n\n=== Half-Goblins ===\nGoblins  have  been  able to breed with other goblinoids as well as humans, elves and orcs,\nthough  as with all goblinoids the offspring as a rule is sterile. Goblin halfbreeds, known as\nthe   Half-Goblin,   or   ''Voltoj''   (meaning  'Strong  ones')  tend  to  look  like  a  more\nproportioned  version  of  a  goblin,  both in weight and height. Key goblin features such as\nthe  large  nose  and  ears remain, but eye and hair colour unseen in pureblood goblins can\noccur.\n\nThe  most  interesting type of Voltoj is one with an active growth gene, which, when paired\nwith  natural  height gained from the non-goblin parent, and the idea of exponential growth\nfrom  the  gene,  allowed  them to become 7-foot-tall monstrosities. One such case was the\nfamous circus performer Pozlong the Long.\n\n==Society==\n=== Survival of the Fittest ===\nGoblin  society  as a whole can be described as "survival of the fittest". Much of this stems\nfrom  their  ancestral  origins  in  the underground caverns of the Serpentspine, where food\nand  supplies  were  scarce,  and  competitors  were plenty, whether it be orcs, dwarves and\neven other goblins themselves.\n\nDue  to  the  large  number  of  goblins, goblins often placed little value on goblin life over\nother,  rarer  things,  such  as  treasures  and  knowledge.  A  disobedient goblin could find\nthemselves  killed  and simply replaced with another willing servant, and a goblin could die\nfrom   any  other  hazard  in  the  dark  caves  of  the  mountain.  As  goblins  often  found\nthemselves  dominated  by  other  races  or  focusing on survival, it led to what goblins call\n"smarts" and "sneak" to be the most prized talents, for goblins often that can outsmart and\noutsneak  their  competitors  (i.e.  other  goblins)  would often rise to the top of the goblin\nfood  chain.  This  trend  has  continued to this day and most goblins keep self-interest and\nself-preservation as their highest priority."
 page_events.2082.t: "Goblin 4 / 6"
 page_events.2082.d: "\n\n=== Family and Clan Structure ===\nPolygamy  and  open  relations  were the norm in goblin culture, with many goblins having\nmultiple  partners  at  once.  It  was  common  for goblins to have over twenty siblings and\nhalf-siblings, which paired with the expectations of goblin society meant that familial bonds\nwere  uncommon  -  with many goblins seeing family as nothing more than other goblins to\ncompete   against,   only   forming   the  rare  bond  with  their  parents.  With  the  brutal\nself-serving nature of traditional goblin society, those in the Serpentspine were often known\nto  conduct  "mating  raids",  where the goblins of all genders would abduct and mate with\ntheir desired partner before leaving them again.\n\nMost  goblin  children  in  the  Serpentspine were abandoned by their parents, if they knew\nthem, and left to fend for themselves shortly after they were born, as many goblins believed\nthat  if  the  goblin  babes  were  not  able to fend for themselves in youth then they did not\ndeserve to survive and take part (and consume resources) in goblin society.\n\nMuch  of  how  a  goblin  clan  works  is  a  mimicry  of  the orcish clans they were usually\nsubservient  to  during  their  time  in  the Serpentspine. However, unlike orcs goblins as a\nwhole  did not hold blood and lineage to great importance. A goblins affiliation with a clan\nwas to where their priorities lied or which clanboss (an equivalent of a chieftain) they liked\nat  the  time. This did mean that goblin clans were a fluid structure, and many goblins have\nrisen from the lowest rungs of the clan to becoming a boss themselves.\n\n=== Surface Goblins ===\nAfter the Greentide many goblins found themselves leaderless and little more than refugees\nin  the  surface,  causing  many  to  live  in  the  human cities of Cannor. The core ideas of\n'survival of the fittest' still remained amongst the surface goblins, but their place in a world\nwhere  they  were a minority created a sense of goblin unity amongst the disparate peoples.\nGoblin families were still large but more goblins knew their parents and siblings more than\ntheir  ancestors did in the Serpentspine, with sibling rivalry a concept encouraged by goblin\nparents. While a great number of goblins were still orphaned or left to fend for themselves,\nmany  were  adopted  by  the rising goblin gangs and even goblin cartels, who raised goblin\nchildren as their own, most likely to keep the inflow of recruits strong."
 page_events.2083.t: "Goblin 5 / 6"
 page_events.2083.d: "\n\nWith their innate need to be the best and their pragmatic nature many goblins flourished in\nmodern  Cannorian society. Their ingenuity and "making ends meet" thinking led to a new\nbranch  of  artificery  called  Goblin  Artificery that maximizes result regardless of safety or\n'elegance'  much  to  the  disparagement  of  their gnomish counterparts. This also led to a\nlarge  number  of  early  goblins  becoming successful traders and businessmen due to their\nruthless  approach to all things mercantile, with many goblin cartels evolving from criminal\nbackgrounds  to  quasi-legitimate  enterprises.  Despite  this,  by  the  18th  century wealth\ndisparity between surface goblins was still incredibly high: you were either very rich or very\npoor.\n\n== Personality ==\nGoblins  tend  to  be  practical  and  cynical  folk, this can be seen in their attitudes against\noutsiders:  depending  on  the  circumstances  they  easily  switch  between  being  subdued\nservants  or  trade partners who use their helpfulness to make themselves a good reputation\nor  aggressive  plundering  and  slaving raiders or even cowards who voluntarily retreat into\nthe  worst  lands  to  spare  themselves  from  a  likely defeat. (As they can follow the same\nmethod for centuries, their neighbours sometimes end up very surprised by such a switch.)\n\nThey  are  also infamous for their cuisine, unsurprisingly as in history they tended to either\nbe driven to the worst territories or enslaved by orcs, forcing them to use ingredients which\nother  races  normally  wouldn't bother to gather or catch or don't even regard as food, like\nvermin,  weeds  or  blood  taped  from  their livestock. Even those in the surface still make\nends  meet  like  this,  often  using  the  many  rats  that  infest  the largest of cities in their\nrecipes.\n\nGoblin  speech  is  often crass amongst goblins, but with their superiors they often speak in\nsubservient  tones  and  phrases  -  but  one must note goblin wit in these cases, as most are\nfilled with sarcastic remarks and insinuations. Not even their higher-ups are spared of this,\nas  they  believe  this  prevents  them  becoming  too  big  for their britches. The Common\nGoblins  have,  in their subjugation by orcs, developed hiding such remarks below a veneer\nof praise into an art form."

 page_events.2084.d: "\n\nMilitarily   goblins  believe  that  fair  fights  are  only  for  the  desperate  and  the  stupid,\npreferring  to  use deception, surprise, agility and range in combat, likely due to their place\nas  one  of  the  weakest  races.  They also are, in general, delighted by wheels, engines and\nexplosions.  Preferably  in  the  shape of warmachines, but they are also content in building\npeaceful   devices   like   cranes,  mills  and  pistons.  It  is  commonly  assumed  that  this\nfascination  has  its roots in overcompensation (both militarily and psychological) for being\nsmall  and  weak.  In  fact  in  their everlasting quest for better explosives they accidentally\ninvented more dyes and cleaning agents than any other race.\n\n== Spirituality and Religion ==\nGoblin religion generally falls into one of three main groups:\n\n*   Traditional   Goblin  Shamanists,  most  common  in  regions  that  are  heavily  goblin\ndominated, such as tribes within the Serpentspine and Escann.\n* Pactseeker warlocks, who are a subset of the Forest Goblins in the Deepwoods.\n*  Followers  of  The  Thought,  predominantly  worshipped  in Bayvic, Anbenncóst and by\nartificer goblins in Haraf.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

 page_events.555.d: "\nGoblin   Shamanism   originated   as  a  polytheistic  and  shamanistic  religion  containing\nelements  of  ancestor  worship  and animism. It is a complex religion based on the idea of\nthe  individual,  with  each  goblin  primarily  believing  in  one  over  all others. Cults are\nderived  from  both  traditional  Goblin Shaman beliefs and the religions of subjugated and\nallied   peoples   leading   to   a   wide  variety  in  beliefs  among  worshippers  of  Goblin\nShamanism.\n\n== Core Tenets ==\nGoblin  shamanism  is  a  diverse  spiritual  belief  system that is practiced by many goblin\ncommunities.  It  is a nature-based faith that believes in the interconnectedness of all living\nthings  and  the presence of spirits in the world. The shamans, who are the spiritual leaders\nof  the  community,  play  a  crucial  role  in  mediating  between  the physical and spiritual\nrealms.  They  are  responsible  for  communicating  with  spirits,  performing  healing and\ndivination  rites,  and  maintaining  the  balance  between  the natural world and the goblin\ncommunity.\n\nThe  diversity  of  goblin  shamanism is reflected in the varied practices and rituals that are\nperformed  by  different  goblin  communities.

While the\ngod each clan puts first varies. The most common are as follows:\n\n=== Kroozmuta Zemna, Grandmother Earth ===\nShe  is  the personification of the earth itself and the oldest goddess in the pantheon. She is\nin  charge  of  the underworld, explaining why it is believed that the worst places of hell are\nreserved  for  those  who  betray  their  mother.  She  is  primarily  worshipped  by the cave\ngoblins, as the rest abandoned her after being thrown out of the caves by the dwarves.\n\n=== Kroozbuto Nubo, Grandfather Sky ===\nThe  second  oldest  god  and the father of all stars, his domain exists out of the milky way.\nHe  ended  up  as  the  god  of  rain  and winds after he was overthrown by his children, he\npassive-aggressively  throws  storms  at Halann whenever he gets irritated and thinks he can\nget away with it.\n\n=== Tewaka Sunka, Aunt Sun ===\nFormerly  the  most  powerful  of  all  gods,  she  once  ruled  all  of  creation before being\noverthrown  by  her  children and younger sister, the moon. She was then forced to become\nthe  sun  by  being  chained  to  a  flying  chariot,  but according to the Exodus goblins, she\nsecretly   runs  the  universe  using  her  plots  and  schemes  and  led  them  to  their  new\nhomeland. It is also believed she learned the goblins the arts of medicine and shamanism.\n\n=== Muta Mestika, Mother Moon ===\nThe  goddess of justice and rulership. According to the hill goblins, she became the current\nhead of the pantheon, after overthrowing her older sister and forcing her to become the sun\nby  chaining her to a flying chariot. It is said she only speaks in puns and double entendres,\nas the goblins regard those as the highest form of poetry."

With his lightning arrows, he\ncan  defeat  whole  armies  of  evil  spirits.  However,  according  to a bunch of militaristic\ncommon  goblins who have risen up against their Orcish masters he was responsible for the\ndeath  of  the  Dookanson  and is now warring with both Great Dookan and the Cannorian\ngods and calling upon his followers to join his struggle.\n\n=== Vortza Lesa, Lady Forest ===\nShe  is  mainly  seen  as  a  mediator between goblinkind and all the forest spirits. Still, the\nforest  goblins  in  the Deepwoods go much further and see her as the personification of all\nnature and thus the only deity worthy of worship.\n\n=== Vortzo Laukuno, Lord Agriculture ===\nHe  isn't  normally  regarded  as  an  important  god, however, an exception are the Exodus\nGoblins with whom he has highly risen in rank after having conquered a fertile agricultural\nregion  as  his  homeland. Thanks to a deal between the gods he has to spend a third of the\nyear  in  the  underworld,  so  he can only spend the rest of the year with his wife the forest\ngoddess,  above  ground.  The  time  spent  in  the  underworld  is  generally  referred to as\n'winter'.\n\n=== Vortza Krpa, Lady Cloth ===\nThe  goddess  of  weaving,  trade,  and many other crafts. As the daughter of Strahllena and\nBlexim,  she  was  raised  by  the  other  gods  who  tossed  her  around  like  a hot potato.\nHowever,  this  allowed  her  to  learn  many  trades.  She  ended up marrying Wezariff for\nbusiness reasons. (i.e. in exchange for him stopping to constantly rob her.)\n\n=== Zvaiko Udenzo, Star Water ===\nA  rogue  star,  when  the  other  gods were busy fighting each other, he carved out his own\ndomain  in  the  seas, he ended up wounded in the fighting and now wears an eye patch and\nwooden  leg.  He  acts  as  the  protector of pirates and fishers. It is also believed he causes\nfloods when he's drunk, so it is forbidden to sacrifice alcohol to him."

She is\nmarried to Foorrem, the god of metalworking.\n\n=== Vortzo Liezmo, Lord Fire ===\nAs  the god of fire, furnaces, and industry, he is the protector of smiths and also the miners\nwho  supply  them with the material. It is said he managed to trick Kroozmuta Zemna into\nallowing those who plundered Halann, her realm, into the good parts of the afterlife.

Goblins can frequently be seen\nclaiming to be avatars of all sorts of Gods.\n\n=== Ancestor Worship ===\nGoblin   shamanism   has   historically  placed  a  strong  emphasis  on  ancestor  worship.\nHowever,  after  examining  the  records  and  temples  of  dwarves,  a  reformation  in  the\nrecording  of  history  took  place  within  a  cult.  In  emulation  of  the dwarves' "halls of\nmemory,"   goblin   communities  started  creating  repositories  of  relics  to  preserve  the\nachievements  of  their ancestors and contemporaries for future generations. The emulation\nof  these  great deeds became a dominant aspect of the religion, as goblins sought to restore\nthe prestige and greatness of their ancestral dwellings in the breathtaking ruins."

 page_events.2088.d: "\n\n=== Cult of Reason ===\nThought  to  be  a  variation  on  The  Thought.  Increasingly popular among the artificers,\nTeacher  Reason, the god of logic and thought, is cold and easily distracted, but vastly fond\nof  the  thinking  beings,  who  he  shepherds  with  timely inspiration. The Cult of Reason\nworships  the  Teacher  through  philosophy  and  mental  exercise, spending entire days on\nesoteric math problems and arguing over complex metaphysical points.\n\n=== Godfound Cult ===\nThe  hobgoblins  of  the Command have a unique approach to religion. They have rejected\ntheir  traditional  gods  and  adopted  a  new  system  based  on  strict  military  and family\nhierarchy, in which religion plays no role. Some shamans saw this as an opportunity and set\nout  to  find the forgotten hobgoblin gods. They claimed to have discovered these lost gods,\nwho were said to be greatly diminished and in desperate need of followers. Despite the fact\nthat  their  names  were  not  known,  the shamans established a cult dedicated to them and\nperformed  offerings  and  rituals  to  keep  them  alive. The reasoning behind this was that\nthese gods were responsible for shaping the hobgoblins into who they were before they were\nabandoned, and they may be able to do the same for the goblins.\n\n=== Cult of the Khet ===\nThe   rumors   of  the  Khet,  the  cat-faced  humans  in  the  southern  deserts,  have  been\nwidespread.  They  were renowned for their lavish lifestyle and indolence, but also for their\nsupernatural  abilities  that  surpass  common  magic.  The  shamans  uncovered the reason\nbehind their god-like power: It was not their luxury and idleness that limited their strength,\nbut rather, it was these very traits that bestowed upon them immense power. By conserving\nall  their  energy  and  exerting  no effort in movement or thought, they had achieved divine\nstatus.  Consequently,  many wealthy goblins, motivated by the shaman's revelations, made\nattempts to attain similar power.\n\n=== Demon Cult ==="

 page_events.2089.d: "\nThe  gnolls  have a history of successful conquests, often attributed to instances of demonic\npossession  among  their  ranks.  In  an  effort  to replicate this power, some shamans have\nstarted  performing  rituals  to  worship  demons in hopes of inviting possession in goblins.\nDespite  limited  success  in  actual  possession,  the  shamans  have  found ways to create a\nconvincing  illusion  of  possession through the use of smoke and noises created by burning\nspecific  mushrooms  and  mosses. As they continue their efforts towards actual possession,\nthe shamans have been able to project the appearance of a demonic champion, striking fear\ninto both enemies and subjects alike.\n\n=== Silver Cult ===\nHistorical  records  show  instances  of  friendship  between  goblins  and  elves.  One such\ninstance  occurred  when  a group of Ibevari adventurers offered protection to goblin slaves\nmistreated by the Thorn Company, leading to their resettlement in Thanas. Later on, elven\nand  goblin  magnates formed a factional bloc in the Northern League's parliament, leading\nto  the development of the cultural tradition of Silver Shamanism. In this tradition, goblins\nadopted elven magic, language, and material traditions, receiving aid and consultation from\nthe more progressive segments of elven society. In exchange, goblins provided numbers and\ntechnological innovation, each party strengthening the other's weaknesses.\n\n=== Sun Cult ===\nThe  Sun  Cult  shamans  had  a  goal  to  incorporate other races into worshiping Tewanka\nSunka.  To  achieve  this,  they  altered  her  worship  to  include  names  and themes from\nexisting Bulwari religions. Over time, this objective was lost and the Sun Cult evolved into\na separate entity with beliefs distinct from the original worship of Aunt Sun.\n\n=== Gerudian Cult ===\nThe  tendency of goblins to be easily distracted has been acknowledged for a long time, and\nthe  shamans  found  it  difficult  to maintain their audience amidst the various distractions\nand   pleasures   that  goblins  indulge  in.  In  response,  they  took  inspiration  from  the\ncaptivating   storytelling  and  musical  talent  of  northern  skalds  and  introduced  vibrant\nworship  sessions  featuring powerful music, intricate lyrics, and elaborate costumes. These\nsessions  were  intended  to  keep  the  tales  of their gods and the traditions of their people\nalive  in  the  hearts  and  minds of goblins. Over time, their enthusiastic adoption of these\nmusical elements also earned them the respect of the skalds, who shared their bardic magic\nwith the goblins and helped to strengthen their armies."

 page_events.2090.d: "\n\n=== Dookan Cult ===\nThe relationship between orcs and goblins throughout history has been marked by conflict.\nHowever,  since  the  Greentide,  the  two  races  have  had  less close contact, allowing for\ngreater  observation of orcs. Orc worship of Dookan, either the old or new deity, has led to\nimpressive  feats  in  battle.  In  response,  some goblin shamans have attempted to appease\nDookan  through  rituals  in  which  goblins  imitate  orc  behavior,  in  hopes of obtaining\nsimilar success in warfare.\n\n=== Hunt Cult ===\nThe  goblins'  relationship  with  the harpies has been observed to have changed over time.\nInitially,  the  harpies  were  seen  as a threat to the goblins as they hunted in the plains and\ntrees. The goblins would hide and watch the harpies hunt and search for what they desired.\nHowever,  over  time the goblins began to hunt more themselves, seeking what they wanted\nwith  greater  determination. This change in behavior was noticed by the harpies, who then\nbegan to observe the goblins' hunting with interest. Eventually, what was once just a simple\nhunt  became  known as "The Hunt", a term used to describe the concerted effort made by\nthe  goblins  and  their  shamans  to find what they sought. The harpies joined in this hunt,\ncreating a unique relationship between the two species.\n\n=== Fey Cult ===\nThe relationship between the forest goblins and the fey of the Deepwoods had a tumultuous\nhistory. The goblins initially made a pact to serve the fey, but it eventually broke down due\nto  either  the  fey's  capricious  behavior  or  the goblins' greed, leading to a long-standing\nconflict  characterized  by  spiteful  tricks. Over time, the malice behind these tricks faded,\nand  the Wood Elves of the River Grove helped to bring about a resolution. A solution was\nreached  in  which  every  village  appointed  a  Feykeeper,  an  individual  who  acted  as a\nmediator  between  the  village  and  the fey spirits. These Feykeepers lived in isolated huts\noutside the villages and were tasked with negotiating deals with the fey.\n"

 page_events.2091.d: "\n=== The Cult of Paper ===\nThe  social structure of Raheni society has long been of interest to shamans. They observed\nthat  Raheni  society  was  characterized  by  a  rigid  social  order,  with a highly organized\nbureaucratic    workforce    that    meticulously    recorded   every   law,   regulation,   and\ncorrespondence.  In  response,  a group of shamans established the cult of paper to emulate\nthis  level  of  record-keeping. To enhance efficiency and social cohesion, they complicated\nthe   language   used,  making  it  difficult  for  most  goblins  to  understand  the  records.\nAdditionally,  they  implemented  a  system  of  losing  and  finding  records strategically to\nbenefit the social order and themselves.\n\n=== Cult of the Emptiness ===\nThe giantkin that inhabit the dry basins of the great plains and their kin in the far north are\nknown  for  their  insatiable  appetites.  According  to legend, their gods were consumed by\ntheir  own  kind  and  now  exist  as  shattered  fragments  in the bellies of ogres and trolls.\nHowever,  there  are  some  shamans  who  still  sense their presence, albeit partially. They\ndescribe  their  consciousness  as  being  stretched  out  in  a  void  between  sentience  and\noblivion,  collectively  known  as the Maw of Terror. The Maw whispers sweet and terrible\nwhispers into the ears of its shamans, encouraging them to eat and eat for it no longer can.\n\n=== Kravi Oznad, Bloody Beyond ===\nBelieved  to  be  inspired  by  the  centaur  faith.  The  belief in a hidden goblin homeland,\nknown  as  Jazhkredu, is widespread among goblin cults. The interpretation of this afterlife\nvaries,   with   some  seeing  it  as  a  vast  treasure  trove,  others  as  a  bountiful  field  of\nmushrooms, and others denying its existence altogether. One particular cult, however, goes\na  step further, claiming that Jazhkredu is merely a pale imitation of the true goblin heaven,\nKravi  Oznad.  According  to  the  beliefs of this cult, Kravi Oznad is a plane of abundance\nthat  exceeds all desires, only attainable through a goblin's death in battle. The followers of\nthis  cult  believe  that  they  must take up arms and fight against all who oppose the goblin\nway  of  life,  by  any  means  necessary.  Whether  it be through the accidental discharge of\nweapons,  the explosion of a missile, or through the hands of an opposing force after having\nslain  numerous  others,  death in a manner befitting a goblin is the only way to achieve the\nultimate heaven and leave behind the ordinary afterlife of Jazhkredu."

Both peoples lived in a hostile environment\nsurrounded  by  invaders  attempting  to  reclaim  their  lands.  However, the kobolds were\nunique  in their united, hoard-driven society. The concept of an insatiable desire for wealth\nwas familiar to the goblins, but the kobold's large collections of riches were something new\nand  attractive.  The  goblins  sought  to  adopt this idea, but in their own way by displaying\ntheir  hoards  publicly.  The  shamans  would  oversee  the donations and keep track of the\nwealth of each goblin, allowing for bragging rights among the community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

 page_events.556.d: "\nThe Goblin Writing Systems, having been developed by goblins in the Serpentspine, started\nout  primarily  as  writing  on  rock  and other hard surfaces. To this end, they developed a\nwriting  system  consisting  of  hard  lines  that were easy to etch with sharp rocks into cave\nwalls,  rocks,  or  minerals, each line representing a sound that goblins used in their speech\nand  could  be  read  with  one’s  eyes  or  hands  if it was too dark. The script was ancient,\nthousands  of  years  old,  but  its  usage  was  mostly  used for writing numbers and formal\nnames of areas and the rare great individuals.\n\n== History ==\nWhile understood to have had presence all-throughout the Serpentspine, the most examples\nof  goblinic script were centered around the western caverns that led to the Deepwoods and\nBulwar,  where  the  abundance  of  soft minerals like marble presented an easier time with\nwriting the script. These soft materials ensured this writing system's practicality and ease of\nuse,  retaining  its  usage  in  the  modern day among western goblins and their cousins: the\nforest  goblins,  bringing  their  alphabet  along  with  them  when  they  migrated  into  the\nGreatwoods, replacing stone with wood bark etchings.\n\nLater  on,  goblins  started  producing dyes from serpentbloom and certain rocks, and were\nless  limited  in  their  materials  for writing, this had made it easier to write their alphabet\ninitially,  though  with  time the use of such a writing system grew unpopular due to various\nreasons.  The  text often smeared when using the imprecise methods that goblins employed\n(often  just  using  their  thumbs or brushes made of serpentbloom husks) and many goblin\nclans  found  these  methods lacking. It was during this period that something known as the\nParuzvon  family  of scripts was developed, a logographic style of writing that relied mostly\non  smear  patterns  that  would  become  very  popular as the Serpentspine grew more and\nmore turbulent since the height of the Aul-Dwarov and the much later rise of the orcs.\n\nAlthough  the  alphabetical  system  never  entirely  died  out, most cave goblins in the east\nstarted  using  Paruzvon  as  a primary means of written communication instead, with those\nfurthest  east  surrounded  by  hard  stones  having  the most history with it. The goblins in\nEscann  pre-greentide,  however,  never  adopted  Paruzvon,  and  their  descendants  in the\nDeepwoods to this day maintain their use of the goblin alphabet."

 page_events.2093.d: "\n\n== Different Systems ==\n\n=== The Alphabet system (Jabozhuki) ===\nGoblin  script reads from left to right, with the script being written between two lines. The\ntop  line,  known  as  the  ceiling,  is interrupted between different words, while the bottom\nline,  known  as  the  floor,  is  interrupted  between  different  sentences.  Because  of this\nstructure,  all  sentences  are  written  continuously,  which would eventually lead to goblin\nbooks being significantly wider than those of most species, to accommodate long sentences.\n\nThe  alphabet  is  known  as  the  Jabozhuki,  named after the first four letters of the goblin\nalphabet  as was discovered in lands that were once known to be held by the thieving arrow\nclan, those being J, B, Z, and K.\n\n\n=== The Logographic System (Paruzvon) ===\n\nThe  Paruzvon  family  of  scripts  developed as a response to intensifying struggles between\ngoblins and their environment, as well as the practicality of the creation of a writing system\nthat  could communicate ideas quickly and effectively to those who needed them, as well as\nerasing them whenever the need arose.\n\nThe  amount  of  symbols a particular goblin clans uses ranges from a few to a few hundred\nsymbols,  depending  on  just  how  ingrained  the  system is for their communication. The\nfurther  west  into  the Serpentspine you go, the more of a mixed system you get. While the\nfurther east you go, you see more of a reliance on Paruzvon, with the squatters and clans of\nthe  far  east having the most intricate and formalized systems of standard pronunciation. A\nvast majority of goblins, however, mainly used Paruzvon to supplement their primarily oral\nform  of  communication,  with  most goblins knowing only a few key pictograms that hold\nuniversal meaning of which can be seen top right:"

The spider clans were known to have had a complex\nsystem  of keeping records that used rocks wrapped in silk. Some extremely early examples\nof  Jabazhuki  script written with silk have been discovered, but as the generations passed it\nseemed that an entirely original writing system eclipsed it and became more practical in the\ndepths of the spider caves.\n\nIt  does  share  one  trait with Jabazhuki, though, where even if blinded, it can be read with\none’s fingers in the dark.\n\n=== Overclan (Defunct) ===\nAccording  to  imperial  records  of  the  Overclan,  there  was  once an attempt to create a\ngoblinic-derived  script  for  its  Bulwari  people,  one  that  combined  the  language  with\ngoblinic  script. However this was ultimately deemed a failure and scrapped. The examples\nof  goblinic  script  that  were  preserved  seemed  to be a much curvier form of Jabozhuki.\nScholars  of  old  goblin  society  consider  this  a  sort of short-lived archaic experiment of\ncursive  Jabozhuki.  Eventually,  goblins  in  the  Overclan  would adopt the Bulwari script,\nwhile  adding  in some custom letters for C, J, O, and V, which Bulwari does not make use\nof."

It  is  a  newer variant of the Old Dookan faith, and one that\nemphasizes  Dookan's  role  as  a  wrathful  and vengeful god, one that was wronged by the\nRegent  Court,  and  that  the orcish race was created to free him from his divine prison by\nbringing vengeance upon the gods and their worshippers.\n\n==History==\nIt  is  believed  the  Dookan  was  once  a  chief  lieutenant of the god of war, Agrados, but\ninstead  betrayed  his  master  for  coin  and  fought  in  the  service of Castellos during the\nGodswar, calling true to his original portfolio as the god of mercenaries.\n\nBoth  orcish  shamans  and  cannorian  scholars claim that Dookan was promised not gold,\nbut  the power to create his own race, like the other gods had done already, in addition to a\nland where his race could flourish like the dwarves did in the Serpentspine under Halanna.\nHowever, despite being a major factor in victory for Castellos' faction, Dookan was instead\nbetrayed and tricked into a dwarven prison by the gods. The true location of this prison has\nremained secret but is rumoured to be in the deepest reaches of the Serpentspine where the\nmaterial  plane  meets  the infernal, known to orcs as Dookan's Cage and to the dwarves as\nThe Heart of Doom.\n\nBoth  sides  agree  that  Dookan  was  imprisoned,  but for different reasons, but both sides\nagree  that  Dookan  himself  shed  a  portion  of  his  divinity which allowed himself to be\nweakened  in order to create the orcish race from his own flesh and blood which would one\nday free him.\n\n===Aelantiri Resurgence===\nWith  the  eventual  collapse of the Greentide, the Cannorians began enslaving the defeated\norcs and sending them to Aelantir, which at the early ages of colonization were inhospitable\nthan  most  -  which  was  well suited to the hardy nature of orckind. Many orcs, especially\nthose  surviving  shamans of Dookan, began to interpret the inability of their slavers to live\nin  these  regions  as  proof  they  had  been  sent  to  the  land once promised to the Great\nDookan.  This  led  to  a  resurgence  of  religious  sentiment  among  the  orcish  slaves of\nAelantir, and would lead to many religiously-influenced slave uprisings."

However,  a  small number of non-orcish mercenaries and soldiers\nhave been known to pay homage to the orc god from time to time.\n\nAs  it  is  said  Dookan  shred his own divinity to create the orcish race the race as a whole\nclaims  divine  descendance  from him, something that is unseen amongst the other gods of\nCannor.\n\nDuring  the  later  stages  of  the  Greentide  the  prominent shaman Dhuram Clouded Eye\nintroduced  the idea of the orcish soul. It is said that half-orcs and worthy non-orc enemies\nand  allies  of  the  orcish  peoples  could infact have an "orcish soul" which would explain\ntheir   bravery  in  battles,  and  validify  their  service  under  Great  Dookan  if  possible.\nNon-orcs  with  orcish  souls  were  said  to  be reincarnations of famous orcish warriors of\nhistory  but  many  Cannorian scholars refute this, and claim that it is a half-hearted reason\nat  best to retain control over the vast swathes of half-orc populace that appeared in the late\nGreentide.\n\n==== Death, Reincarnation and the Afterlife ====\nFollowers  of  the  Great  Dookan  do  not  believe in an afterlife but instead believe in the\nreincarnation  of the orcish soul. Death through honourable battle is the most common way\nto  guarantee  reincarnation,  in which the soul will be reborn into a new entity. Those who\nact  with  dishonour,  more  notably  in trickery or deceit, or commit cowardice or suicide,\nwill  have  their  soul destroyed forever by Dookan, leaving nothing behind and their deeds\nforgotten."

As most Old Sun Cult sects, their early history is partially known from very\nbiased  sources  :  either  Jaherian Examplars or sources from the order itself. According to\nthe  szal-Harrumanz  official  chronicle, the young Ashuru szal Harumanz fled North to the\nkingdom  of  Birsartanšes  following  the  Medurabari  Purge  of  1220  and  settled  in the\nmountains near Kuzak and Garkas-szel-Azka where he gathered the Fardašin (Faithful).\n\nThe  main  difference  between  what would become the Green Helmets and the other sects\nrejecting  the  divinity of Elves, came from the question of lying. Truth is one of the biggest\ntenets  of  the  Cult,  all  Sun  faiths  agreeing  that  "one  should  speak  no lie". The sects\ndeveloped  a theology they called Ašanu (Bulwari for Sheltering), centered around the right\nto  lie  by  omission  as  necessary  to  shelter  the  remaining  Light.  But  Ashuru  saw the\nMedurubari  Purge  as  the  logical  outcome  of  the sects which were still easily found out\nbecause of these partial omissions. He developed a theology of Šanqu (Prudence), allowing\nthe  faithful  to  lie  about  religious  affairs  in  the face of Elven persecution. The extreme\nsecrecy  of  the  Fardašin  allowed  them  to  flourish  in  the highlands of the Harpy Hills,\nArantir  of  Birsartanses  more  concerned  with the threat of Harpies than orthodoxy in the\nmountains.  A  descendant  of Ashuru even rose in Birsartanšesi Human nobility, becoming\nthe  caretaker  of the Kuzak stronghold, a choke point between Gelkalis and Birsartansbar.\nNonetheless,  these  "Faithful"  made themselves known by the occasional practice to send\nyoung  men murder some officials throughout Bulwar wearing Green Helmets, the color of\npurity and faith in the region.\n\nWhen  Dartaxes  rebelled,  the  szal-Harrumanz family allied with him and their fortress in\nKuzak  became the main stronghold of the rebellion. Eventually Dartaxes would convert to\ntheir  faith,  and  the Green Helmets would become widespread throughout his army, as an\nelite  and  fanatical  force,  assembling  many sects around the core Fardašin to become the\nmainstream theology of the Akalate of Dartaxâgerdim.\n"

It is commonly divided into three phases: the initial orcish incursion of orc raiders,\nfollowed  by  a  second  incursion  by  the  Bloody  Tusks orc clan, with the final incursion\nentailing  a  combined  host  of  three  major  orc  clans  (Cursed  Howl,  Blackmoon, and\nSilentblade) and a number of minor accompanying orcish clans.\n\nUnlike the Greentide of Escann, the initial conflict between those native to the Deepwoods\nand  orcs  received  little notice by contemporaries. The first group of orcish invaders were\nfended  off  by  Salla  Myna,  led  Galyndor  Myna.  The  following invasion by the orcs of\nBloody  Tusk  found  initial  success  against  Galyndor  and  the  Myna  elves. However, a\nmarriage-alliance  between Galyndor's heir, Bricena Myna and a scion of Salla Elyn turned\nthe tide against the orcs. The final invasion, however, proved too much for Salla Myna and\nSalla  Elyn, who were forced to retreat to Ciranmyna. The orcs then ravaged through much\nof  the  central  and  eastern  groves  of  the  Deepwoods.  The  threat  of  complete  defeat\nprompted  the  remaining elven clans to come together for the Conclave of Elynáile. There\nthe  Wood  Elves  agreed  to  form  an  alliance  to  face  the  orcish invaders known as the\nVerdant Pact.\n\nHowever,  before  any  major  battles  could  be  fought  between  the Verdant Pact and the\nGreentide,  the  invasion ground to a halt. While elves had worked to form an alliance, the\nGreentide  in  the  Deepwoods  had shattered. Internal strife caused Cursed Howl to break\naway,  while  Blackmoon  left due to conflict with the Ashentree Fey. At the same time, the\nVerdant  Veil suddenly collapsed and with it soon came news of Korgus Dookanson's death\nat the hands of Corin. With Dookanson's death went any semblance of orcish unity.\n\n== Background ==\n\nFrom  the  Day  of  Ashen  Skies  to  1443,  a  magical  veil  had encompassed much of the\nDeepwoods,  known  as the Verdant Veil. Due to the Veil, few creatures from the Material\nPlane  could  crossover to the Feyrealm. Similarly, creatures from the Material Plane, such\nas  the  Forest Goblins were trapped in the Feyrealm. For its nearly one and half millennia\nduration,  only  a  few  notable crossings between planes by mortals occurred. The first was\nby  an  army  of  Moon Elves during the War of the Sorcerer-King. Once crossed over, the\nelves became trapped, like the Forest Goblins."

It  was  then, by what is believed to be chance, the orcs were able to cross the\nVerdant  Veil and enter the Mountain Grove of Salla Myna. The orcs seemed to have been\nconfused  by the sudden loss of their pursuers and more confused by the sudden appearance\nof  the  elvish villages. However, the orcs quickly set upon continuing their work of raiding\nand  successfully  sacked a few Myna settlements. These small victories were then followed\nwith  a  swift  defeat  the  hands of Galyndor Myna, the leader of Salla Myna and known as\n"the Old Fox of the Mountain".\n\nLost  in  the  hostile Deepwoods and hounded by enemies native to it should have been the\nend  of  the  orcs.  Instead,  the  orc  raiders  were  saved by the most unlikely persons, orc\nscouts  from Clan Bloody Tusk. Escaping into the Hunter's Grove, the raiders learned that\nthe  Bloody Tusk orcs had been living in the Deepwoods for a few generations. During that\ntime,  they  had settled into a corner of the Hunter's Grove and squabbled with the elves of\nSalla Faelgarn and goblins of Groundhawk.\n\nAs  a  result  of  this  mingling,  a number orc raiders elected to stay with the Bloody Tusks\nwhile  many  younger  Bloody  Tusks rose up to join the raiders in attempting to escape the\nDeepwoods.  After  learning  that  Salla  Myna  was  amongst the stronger of the Wood Elf\nclans, the orcs elected to travel south into the Thorn Grove where one of the weakest clans,\nSalla  Drennen, was. Upon entering the Thorn Grove, the orcs stumbled upon a contingent\nof Drennen elf soldiers preparing against an invasion from Salla Cenág."

One orc notorious for his\nberserking,  Khagur, managed to cleave through the elven frontline and decapitate the elven\ncommander  and  leader  of  Salla  Drennen,  Celadil  Drennen.  With Celadil's death, the\nelven  line  shattered.  The victorious orcs declared Khagur "the Sapchopper", in reference\nto  his  axe  cleaving  through  elves. In return, Khagur declared the orcs present to be clan\nSapchopper.\n\nRiding  high  on  victory,  Khagur  and  the  orcs  continued  to advance through the Thorn\nGrove,  in plans of burning Drennen villages and taking elven slaves. These plans would be\nunexpectedly  thwarted by the young daughter of Celadil Drennen, Narawen Drennen. In a\ndesperate  bid  to  save  her clan from the two invaders, Narawen used her magic to invoke\nthe  aid  of  an  unnamed  trickster fey. The result was a mysterious fog overtaking the orcs\nand redirecting their march. When the orcs emerged, they found themselves in the midst of\nthe invading army of Salla Cenág. A battle soon erupted as the lost orcs began attacking the\nconfuse  elves.  The  ensuing melee proved to be a chaotic one with neither side having any\nchance  of  forming battle lines. This chaos was proved favorable to the orcs though as they\nrelied shock and might over drill. After an hour of fierce and bloody fighting, no victor had\nemerged.  Indeed  a  victor  would  never  emerge, as the orcs found themselves taken once\nmore by a fog and were lost leaving behind a battered and baffled Cenága army. These orcs\nwould not be seen again by the mortals of the Deepwoods until well over a decade later.\n\n== Second Orcish Incursion ==\n''The following section includes confirmed instances of time travel.''\n\n=== The Second Invasion of Salla Myna ===\nThe  next  major invasion of orcs came in at the height of the summer in 1433 AA. During\nthis  time,  the  orcish clan of Bloody Tusk(Author's note - the orcs of Bloody Tusk are the\nancestors  of  the  orcs  met  in  the  first orcish incursion) was repeatedly skirmishing with\nadventurers of the Stalwart Band. After one such skirmish, the clan entered the Deepwoods\nin  an  attempt  to  bypass  or out maneuver the adventurers. In what was believed to be fey\nintervention,  the orcs crossed the Verdant Veil and entered the Mountain Grove just as the\norcs  of  the  first incursion had. They then soon encountered the elves of Salla Myna, who\nrecognized the orcs as invaders, and were attacked."

Instead, elves and orcs settled into a stalemate with the elves being\nunable  to  meet  the  orcs  in open battle and orcs being unable to force such a battle. The\nstalemate  would  remain  until  marriage  of Bricena Myna, first daughter of Galyndor and\nheir  to  Salla  Myna,  to  Arfil  Elyn, the youngest son of Cinrthir Elyn, the Ceann of Salla\nElyn.  The act of union secured an alliance between, arguably, the two most powerful wood\nelven clans of the Deepwoods.\n\n=== Orcish Defeat and Time Travel ===\nWith  this  new  found  might,  Galyndor  mustered the elves of Myna into a new band and\nbegan  a  campaign to draw the orcs of Bloody Tusk out into a trap. He would find field of\nchoosing  in  Prehnryn.  There,  Galyndor  feigned  being  trapped  and allowed the orcs to\ncharge  and  engage  his  forces.  The  orcs  initially saw success as the Myna elves buckled\nagainst  the  orcish charge. This success swiftly dissipated when Cinrthir and the Elyn elves\nemerged  from the hills and began to rain missiles on the tied up orcs. As the orcs began to\nrealize the tide had turned, they began falter and flee. Retreat turned to route and the battle\nswiftly closed with the two Sallas in pursuit of the orcs.\n\nLuckily for the orcs, their choice to flee toward the outskirts of the Mountain Grove where\nthe  Deepwoods turned into a darkened mass of trees and canopies would a life saving one.\nThe  reason  was,  while the Verdant Veil still stood, entering these parts of the Deepwoods\nwas  a  certain  way  to  lose  yourself  in  the Feyrealm. Only by travelling down one of the\n"Vyrs" (elven for road) could one safely travel from one grove to another.\n\nIt is unknown how long the orcs were lost in the Feyrealm, but what is known is this. First,\nclan  Bloody Tusk would find itself not in the Mountain Grove, but instead in the Hunter's\nGrove. Second, the orcs would find themselves 75 years in the past.\n\nExhausted  and  lost,  the  orcs  chose  to make camp and settle the area. The settling land,\nnominally  under  Salla  Faelgarn  and  often  contested by the Forest Goblin Groundhawk\nClan,  would  spark  a  long  standing  three way conflict between the orcs, wood elves, and\nforest goblins who each claimed the area. This conflict would be shook up by the arrival of\nthe orcish raiders who later become Clan Sappchopper. But, ultimate resolution would not\noccur until the arrival of the main orcish host."

By this time, much of\nChivalric  Escann  had  fallen  to the Greentide and the orcs were focused more in pushing\nout  from Escann. In the south, this attempt to push out was held back by the citadel of Bal\nDostan.  The  long  siege  of  the fortress had made little progress causing many of the orcs\nthere  to consider a different path into Courvia to cut off the supplylines to the fortress and\nenable further conquests.\n\nIt  was  here  that  an  Ashentree  archfey  named the Prince of the Blackened Branch (also\nknown  as  the  Blackened  Prince) intervened. Glamoured as an orc, the Prince infiltrated\nthe orcish host and sowed rumors of a possible route through the Deepwoods. The promise\nof  easy  resolution  convinced  the  clans Blackmoon, Cursed Howl, and Silentblade and a\nnumber  of  minor  clans to form an expedition into the forest to find this route. When the\nhorde  entered  the  Deepwoods,  they  unknowingly crossed the Verdant Veil thanks to the\nBlackened Prince's machinations.\n\nUpon  their  arrival  in  the  Mountain  Grove, the host was immediately assaulted by Salla\nMyna,  who  was accustomed now to weaker incursions.

It was here that the first faltering of orcish unity\nbegan  as  the  clans  realized they have traded one siege for another. But, before any major\ndevelopment  could  occur,  the Blackened Prince (still glamoured as an orc) stepped in to\nTroknar  Silentblade,  chief of clan Silentblade, the gladeway into Hunter's Grove.

The  demand  is met with a\nmuted response, leaving Vord to get his way.\n\n=== Oberon's Flight ===\nMuch  like  when  they  first entered the Mountain Grove, the orcish host was immediately\nbeset  upon  arriving  in  the  Hunter’s Grove. This time it was not the Wood Elves but the\nForest  Goblins  of the Groundhawk clan. Groundhawk, experienced in fighting the orcs of\nBloody  Tusk,  shocked the orcish host with its grit and organized guerrilla tactics. Neither\nof  which  the  orcs  had ever seen or expected from goblins. While the Forest Goblins did\nnot  truly affect the orcs' advance, their actions marked the beginning of the steady attrition\nof orcish goblin slaves, whose freedom became the primary objective of Groundhawk.\n\nPushing  through  Groundhawk  lands,  the Greentide orcs were once again shocked again.\nThis time due to their encounter with the Bloody Tusks clan. As the orcs intermingle, news\nof   how   the  Bloody  Tusks  had  been  trapped  in  the  Deepwoods  for  decades  spread\nthroughout  the host. Worse was new came when the Bloody Tusks explained that the wood\nelves  and  forest  goblins  had  been trapped for centuries. Panic that horde was lost to the\nDeepwoods  began  to  fracture  the  already  shaken orcish unity. Before too much damage\ncould  be  done,  the  still  disguised  Blackened  Prince  reassured Troknar that escape was\npossible.  In  turn,  Troknar  then  convinced  the  other  two major clan leaders of Cursed\nHowl  and  Silentblade  to  work  together long enough to escape. Upon agreement the trio\nthen  moved to secure the host's loyaltyby making an open challenge to Orzam’Chadash for\nany dissenters to take. However, none would do so.\n\nAs  the  Greentide  began to move once more, they then encountered Oberon Fealgarn and\nthe  elves  of Salla Faelgarn. A gifted stag rider and commander, Oberon boldly engaged in\nvarious  skirmishes  against  the  orcs. Lacking the natural defenses of Salla Myna, Oberon\ninstead  relied  on  stag  mounted  archers to stem the orcish advance. This strategy proved\neffective  until  an  orcish  shaman  by  name of Og used his magic to ensnare the mounted\nelves  with  roots and undergrowth.

These jibes proved to particularly effective against Chieftain Bolk\nCursed  Howl  who  had  been humiliated by Oberon in the initial encounter with Faelgarn\nforces. Thus began a pursuit that would later be called "Oberon's Flight".\n\nInitially,  Oberon  made  his  way  to  the  Flower  Grove,  home  of  his  ally Salla Scotha.\nConfident  that  the  orcs would take sometime to arrive, Oberon informed his allies of the\npending  invasion.  The  elves of Scotha reacted with fury and indignation that Oberon was\nusing  them  to  protect  his  own  lands.  Nevertheless,  they agreed to combine forces and\nleverage their home's hostile environment to stop the invasion. Unfortunately for the elves,\nthe orcs would arrive in short order thanks to the quiet guidance of the Blackened Prince.\n\nThe  invasion in the Flower Grove would be result in some of the most savage events of the\nentire  Deepwoods  Greentide.

Sharing the same inexperience\nas  the  forest  gobins,  the  disorganized  Scotha  elves  were  forced  to look to Oberon for\nmilitary leadership.\n\nInitially, Oberon attempted to leverage his original strategy of making a stand in the Flower\nGrove.  Darting  across  the  grove,  he  struck  the  orcs  where  could  and let the various\nvenomous  and  toxic  flora  and  fauna  of  the  Flower  Grove  continue his work when he\nretreated.  The  strategy  was  successful  in bleeding the orcs. However, Bolk's viciousness\nagainst  undefended Scotha settlements made it likely that the many Scotha elves would not\nsurvive  the  either.

With  no  intention  of  allowing his grove any more harm, Oberon pressed on into\nthe  River Grove despite knowing he was trespassing on Ahain lands. Indeed as soon as the\narmy entered the grove, it was quickly intercepted by a small group of Ahain border guards\nwho  demanded  they  turn  back.  Lacking  the  tact  or  patience  to  deal with diplomacy,\nOberon  threatened  the  Ahain  guards  into  submission before marching on the capital of\nImyhain.

However, before any blood letting could begin,\nthe  goblin  army  disappeared  due to mysterious figure, leaving only Oubblig behind to be\ncaptured.\n\nCertain that another archfey was involved, the Blackened Prince plays up the strangeness of\nthe  event  to  Troknar  so  that  the  chieftain would demand the horde stop and search for\nclues.  To  surprise  of  both  the  orcs  and the Blackened Prince, they are unable find any\nexplanation  for what had happened. Attempts to pry information out of Oubblig fail as the\ngoblin  proves  just  as  ignorant,  though  his  claims  to be a powerful mage amuse the orc\nchieftain  Relgakk  Blackmoon.

The  shifting of the gladeways\nresulted  in  part  of  the  elven  army  in the Flower Grove and the rest in the River Grove\nrather than arriving together.\n\nIn  the  Flower Grove, the scattered elves were taken by surprise routed by Gordak Cursed\nHowl  and  his  orcs  whose  clan had strangely found itself in the grove after the encounter\nwith  Troknar. Those elves captured were brought in as slaves while the few lucky ones that\nescaped  would disappear into the grove's bogs. With this elven defeat Cursed Howl would\nclaim complete control of the grove, marking the end of general elven resistance here.\n\nMeanwhile,  the  elves  lost  in  the  River  Grove  found themselves able to rally, thanks to\nforgiving  terrain  of  the  River  Grove.  Upon grouping up, they then found initial success\nagainst  the  orcish clan Silvertusk, led by a former orc of the Bloody Tusks called Kharag.\nAs the orcs began to be pushed back, the elves would have their victory snatched away when\nthe  goblins of Verminhusk attack at the behest of the exiled Wood Elf mage Selsusa Ghúl.\nCrushed  between  goblins  and  orcs,  elven  army melted under the pressure.

The main host\nconsisted  only  of  clan Blackmoon and few minor clans while the rest of the clans loyal to\nKorgus  were scattered throughout the woods. Orcish invasion gave way to steady, but static\nskirmishing  with the elves of the Verdant Pact and the few remaining Forest Goblin tribes.\nIn fall of 1444, news from Escann of Korgus Dookanson's death began to reach the orcs in\nthe  Deepwoods.  With  Dookanson's  death  was the death of any reason for further orcish\nattempts to leave the forest. Thus, the Greentide came to a quiet end.\n\n==Consequences and Legacy==\nLike   the   Greentide   in   Escann,   the   Deepwoods   Greentide  would  have  enormous\nconsequences  for  all  of  the  Deepwoods.

Like\ntheir  brethren  before  them,  they  arrived  in  a  Bahar  weakened  and  chaotic  from the\nDecades of Devastation. While they enjoyed the goblins' newfound reputation as objects of\nterror  in  Bulwar,  the  clan  settled  in the foothills of the Serpentspine and kept mostly to\ntheir new home, outside the occasional raid.\n\nAfter  Dookanson's death, more and more goblins came south to the Greysheep's holdings,\nthrough the Glogund Cave entrance.\n\n==Notable Clan Members==\nFrax the Traveler made a name for himself in a quite a different way than his fellow Exodus\nGoblins.  He  began  traveling  the  bright,  new  (to  goblins) over-world and met with the\nmany  peoples  that  live  in  it.  Setting  out in 1440, he traveled to many parts of Bulwar,\nSarhal,  and even made it as far as Rahen. When he returned at last to Greysheep lands, he\nwrote  and  published  a  book of his travels which quickly became wildly popular amongst\ngoblins.\n\n==Economy==\nThe  Greysheep's  name  comes from their peculiar breed of sheep, the fittingly named Big\nGrey  Sheep.  Much  larger  and  bulkier  compared  to  their  human  neighbor's flocks in\nGelkalis, the clan started using these sheep as cavalry in the late 15th century.\n\nWhile  their  sheep  made  for  surprisingly  intimidating mounts, they also provided a very\nunique  wool  that  has  remained  popular  in  goblin fashion, even into today. While more\ncommon  in  Northern Bulwar, you can find goblins and even non-goblins wearing clothing\nmade  with  this  striking  wool  as  far  north  as  Bayvek  and  as far west as Mestikardu in\nAelantir.\n"

He  wrote one of the first modern\nguides  to  the  Serpentspine, a Herbarium and a Bestiary. A descendant of marble dwarves\nrefugees,  originally  from  the great hold of Shazstundihr, Grimmar 's roots trace back to a\nlineage  of  marble  miners.  Some  of  which, according to his clan myths, quarried deeper\ninto  the  Serpentspine  than  any  others  into  the  very  roots of the stone. His family was\namong  the  first  to  help  resettle  the  ruined  hold of Shazstundihr as it was reclaimed by\nArg-Ôrdstun.\n\n=== Early Life and Ancestral Influence ===\nBorn  and  raised  to  a  marble  dwarf  clan  amidst  the  reclamation  rush  of the recently\nrefounded  Shazstundihr,  Grimmar was reared on tales of their ancestral home's grandeur.\nThese  stories,  combined  with  an  intricate  collection  of  drawings  and myths about the\nmysterious  flora  and  fauna  of  the Serpentspine, sparked his lifelong fascination with the\nnatural world.\n\n=== Education and Early Career ===\nFueled by this passion, Grimmar pursued a comprehensive education in natural philosophy\nat  the  prestigious  Guntîrhug  Academy  in  Orlghelovar.  Here,  he  honed  his  scientific\nknowledge  and  developed  a  keen  interest  in the unique adaptations of subterranean life\nforms. His academic excellence earned him recognition and served as a springboard for his\nfuture career as an explorer and biologist.\n\n=== Expeditions and Discoveries ===\nUpon  completing  his  studies,  Grimmar  established  himself  in  Arg-Ôrdstun, where he\nfounded  an  expeditionary  biological  foundation.  This  organization was dedicated to the\nsystematic  and  complete exploration and understanding of the Serpentspine ecosystem and\nbecame  a crucial component of his work and later legacy. From this base, he embarked on\na  series  of  expeditions  into the hitherto unexplored parts of the Serpentspine Mountains.\nBraving  its  rugged  terrain and unpredictable dangers, he cataloged a multitude of species,\nstudied  unique  phenomena  such  as  Halanna's Breath, and developed new theories about\nthe ecosystem's dynamics."

 page_events.2119.d: "\n\n==== Gordwar's Rule ====\nGordwar's Rule is a principle concerning the size of organisms and their relationship to the\nclimate  of  the  Serpentspine  Mountains.  According  to this rule, species living in colder,\nregions are larger in size than their counterparts living in warmer regions\n\nThis  principle  stems  from  the  observation  that  larger  animals  have  a smaller surface\narea-to-volume ratio compared to smaller animals. This means that larger animals are able\nto  conserve  heat  more  effectively  than  smaller ones, making them better adapted to the\ncolder  depths  of  the  Serpentspine  Mountains. On the other hand, smaller animals, with\ntheir  higher  surface  area  to volume ratio, are better at dissipating heat and thus are more\nsuited to the warmer upper regions of the Serpentspine.\n\nGordwar's  Rule  has been observed in numerous species within the Serpentspine, from the\nhulking  cave  trolls  to  the  more  diminutive but equally fascinating cave mice. However,\nGordwar  himself  was  careful  to  note  that  this  rule,  while  generally applicable, is not\nabsolute.  There  are  exceptions  to the rule and other factors, such as diet, predation, and\ninterspecies competition, can influence the size of a species in a given environment.\n\n=== Legacy ===\nGrimmar  Gordwar's contributions to the understanding of Serpentspine ecology have been\ncrucial.  His  works  have  not  only  expanded  the  body  of  knowledge  about the unique\nenvironment  but  also  set  a  precedent  for future explorations and studies. His relentless\npursuit  of  knowledge,  despite  the  inherent  risks  of  his  chosen  field,  has made him a\nprominent  figure  in  dwarven  academia  and  an  inspiration  for  aspiring biologists. His\nstaunch  position  on  the  necessity  of  protecting the local eco-system of the Serpentspine\nwould lead to the founding of several nature reserves within the Dwarovar.\n\n\n"

They are traditionally organized in\ncovens, though some hags do act alone.\n\n==List of Hag Types==\nThough all united in malevolent and magical power, and desire to cause suffering, there are\na variety of different types of hags.\n\n===Green Hags===\nThe  Green Hags are considered the most 'common' of hags, though some believe that this\nis  because  they  live closest to civilization. They are the weakest but the most archetypical\nof  hags,  resembling  old  women and known to be powerful spellcasters. They are also the\nmost   likely   hag   to   work   with  other  non-hags,  either  in  manipulation  or  genuine\ncooperation for whatever twisted goal they hold in common.\n\nThey  were  early  rivals  of  the  Castanites  which  led  to their near-destruction in Escann\nduring  Castan  Beastbane's Second Great Cleansing which saw the Many hags ended up in\nthe  newly  separate  Greatwoods and are one of the theorized creators of werewolves in the\nregion.  The  last  prominent  Green  Hag  coven was the Oldhaven Coven which persisted\nthrough Beastbane's purge up until the Witch Kings Era.\n\nOut  of  all  the  hags,  the  Green  Hags  are said to be most fey-like, reveling in deals and\ntrickeries  upon  mortals.  For  them,  suffering  through  tragedy  is  their  greatest  vice  -\nspouting self-fulfiling prophecies to many a foolish man.\n\nThese  hags are masters of illusion and enchantment, able to take on any vaguely humanoid\nform  at  a whim while their natural resistance to magic prevents their disguises from being\ndisrupted  by  any  but  the  mightiest scrying. As such, rumors persist of modern-day green\nhags  covens  establishing  themselves  in  bustling  cities  rather than swamps and forgotten\nwoodlands of old."

Known for their love of eating children, they're the\ntraditional  bogeyman  of  many fables and most direct confrontations with hags involve the\nannis. As large as ogres, the average annis hag could rip a human in half without any effort,\nand  so need little of the illusions and cunning of other hags to be a threat to a community.\nMany  also establish themselves as leaders over the various giantkin, who come to see them\nas powerful if abusive matriarch figures.\n\nAnnis  hags  are  known  for  forming  covens, but usually not with their own kind - rather,\nthey  prefer  to  align with the more subtle hag varieties to combine their strengths. Usually\nthe  annis  hag  is,  at  least  officially,  the leader of their coven but another hag makes any\nnecessary  agreements with outsiders.

Their powerful mind magic and the vast scope of their\nabilities  make  them able to project magical nightmares, warping the mind of the victim in\nthe process to accentuate their vices and corrupt their virtue.\n\nOut  of  all  hags  they  are  the  ones  most  determined  to fulfill the hag's base nature for\nsuffering,  and  are  known  to construct elaborate schemes and plots to cause suffering and\nnightmares  to all those involved. A centuries-long gambit to uplift an empire through pain\nand conquest just to end it all and cause an even bloodier warlord period is just another day\nfor  a  night  hag.  Because  of  their  long-term outlooks they can be perceived as the most\nreliable  of  their  kind,  with their sufferings dealt in investments to be recouped long after\nthe  initial  bargainer  had  died  (unlike  that  of  the  green  hags, who usually wish to see\nmisfortune  occur sooner rather than later). This should not be mistaken for compassion or\na  sense  of  morality,  for  all  night hags view others solely through the lens of usefulness -\nthey  simply  view  a  reputation  for  honest  dealing  as  more  useful  than the short-term\ncomfort of spite. Nevertheless, like other hags they will respond to being fooled with brutal\nretaliation, for the only thing worse than a reputation for betraying others is a reputation for\nbeing betrayed.\n\nSome  night  hags  have  also  been  known  to make long-term deals in exchange for useful\narcane  knowledge or a powerful magical object, teaching them the more obscure powers of\nnecromancy  in  exchange.  Others  may  take  on  servants, binding them with unbreakable\noaths  in  exchange  for  the  hag's  tutoring.

The\nprimary   problem  was  that  a  magical  origin  was  largely  of  the  unknown,  and  from\nexperimentation  with  Damestear,  a  purely  magical  product, it like the Gigaflow theory\ncould  not  explain  nor find a source for the base nutrients required for a living ecosystem.\nWhile  the  geological theory couldn't explain the magical energy surrounding the area, nor\ngive a satisfying answer to the ''nutrients problem''.\n"

 page_events.2124.d: "\n====Megafauna Theory====\nWith  the  discovery  of  the  abundant  ecosystem of Mycos Caurak and the ancient rotting\ncorpse  of  a  huge snake-like beast covering vast portions of it, the second theory emerged.\nThe  theory  states  that  the  Halanna's  Breath from the Primeval Serpentdepths originates\nfrom the corpses of megafauna, or colossal beasts, and that the biomass and energy released\nfrom  their  corpses  is  carried  through  fissures,  lava  and  other  sources  all  across  the\nSerpentspine - allowing the nutrients to create life.\n\nThis  revelation  captured all peoples, from religious scholars, suggesting that it is Halanna\nor  the  world serpent Malliath's corpse itself that provides such life, to scientists excited of\nthe  prospects  of  colossal  beasts  to  the  masses  reading  the  pulp  short  stories  of  the\n''Primeval  Hunters,''  a  story of a multiracial group exploring the Primeval Serpentdepths\nto tame and defeat the "underbeasts".\n\n==Effects on the Flora==\nHalanna's  Breath  gives the flora not only nutrients but also gives energy to circumnavigate\nthe  dependence  on  the  sun.  Indeed,  the  flowers,  plants  and trees that inhabit this vast\nunderground ecosystem are perfectly capable of surviving and thriving without solar energy,\nrelying  solely  on  what  the  bowels of the earth produce. This has given rise to incredible\nsymbioses,  with  large  numbers  of  bioluminescent  plants  illuminating  vast caverns and\nproducing   the   light   needed   by   other   plants   for  their  survival.  Indeed,  this  very\ncharacteristic  bioluminescence  of  the  Serpentspine  seems to be the result of a prolonged\nexposure  to  the  energy  of  Halanna's Breath or its direct exploitation by the plant, which\ncan  manifest  itself  in many different forms. Sometimes, only the fruits of a tree will have\nthis  characteristic,  while  in  other places, entire meadows will be illuminated by a type of\nplant that is very thin and not very tall, whose entire plant glows with a slightly pearly light,\nsometimes making us almost forget the danger of these caves.\n\n==Effects on the Fauna==\nWhile  still  poorly studied, some recent observations of the effects of Halanna's Breath on\nthe  fauna  of  the  Dwarovar  seem  to  point  toward  a direct causality between Halanna's\nBreath  exposure  and  perceived aggressiveness. But no definitive, or other answers can yet\nbe drawn."

Other  than that, they are treated the exact same as humans or even better,\ndue to their heritage.\n\nDue  to the heroic and attractive nature of elves, many half-elves are born into the ranks of\nnobility and find themselves at the forefront of politics and diplomacy in Cannor. They are\nnaturally  likeable  by  all  races,  and  take the best qualities of their parents, balancing the\nrecklessness ambitions of humanity and the indifferent patience of the elves.\n\nHalf-elves  hold  their  heritage  with pride, often proclaiming themselves the true sons and\ndaughters and upholders of Anbennar, which means unity and communion, after all.\n\n== Society ==\n=== Half-elven Nobility ===\nMany   half-elves   were   born   in   Cannor   shortly   after  the  end  of  the  War  of  the\nSorcerer-King,  likely  due  to  their  status  as  heroic  figures across Cannor but also their\ngeneral  allure  and  attractiveness  to human eyes. This, combined with the elvenization of\nCannor  as  a  whole  made marrying elves, despite the majority of them having no titles of\ntheir  own,  a  popular  occurrence  amongst the human nobility at the time. In addition to\nthis,  many  half-elven  bastards  were  also  born during the time to human monarchs with\nelven  mistresses  and  consorts - some even being legitimized and inheriting or being given\ntitles themselves.\n\nThe  practice  of  nobles  marrying  elves eventually fell out of favour by the end of the The\nInterregnum  and  the Formation of Anbennar in 1221, when the new "half-elven" nobility\nhad  become  so  entrenched  in  Cannor  that  they  no  longer saw the need to "elvenize".\nInstead  the  nobility returned to their first and foremost priority in marriage: gaining more\ntitles  for  the  family and creating political alliances - but instead of doing it among human\nnobles,  they  were  now  also  doing it among the newly created "half-elven" nobility, thus\npreserving  the  alluring  concept  of  'elveness'.  At the forefront of these half-elven nobles\nwere  the  Silver  Families,  descendants  and heirs of the Silver Band which comprised the\nmost accomplished and known of elven heroes during the War of the Sorcerer-King."

A noted difference between the two is their ears:\ngnomish  ears  are  larger and slightly pointed while a halfling's are rounded. Halflings also\nhave  hairy  and  proportionally-large  feet,  a  point  of  pride  for  many,  leading  to them\neschewing footwear except when necessary.

In terms of body build, halflings metabolize quickly\nand  retain excess as fat, giving a healthy halfling a layer of pudge. This high metabolic rate\nis  why  halflings  need  to  consume so much food, resulting in up to seven meal times in a\nsingle day.\n\nHaving  diverged  from  halflings, interracial couples of halflings and gnomes can still have\ngnomeling children, who are sterile.\n\n==History==\n\nThough  it  is  unclear exactly where, when, and why they diverged, the halflings of Cannor\nand  Fahvanosy  can trace their origins to the latter region. It is theorized that the ancestors\nof  the  Cannorian  halflings  migrated  north  by  ship  along  the  western coasts until they\nreached  the  Shattered Bay. There, a population settled on the damestear-laden archipelago\nof  the  Splinters  to  eventually  become  the  gnomes  while  the  majority  settled  on  the\nmainland, giving rise to the Cannorian halflings.\n\nThe Age of Awakening was a time of strained gnome-halfling relations as Gnomish folklore\nsuggests  they  were pushed out of the fertile Dragondowns into the poorer highlands of the\nDragonspine by halfling tribes, only retaking them around 1100 BA. The unification of the\nGnomish  Hierarchy  included  the  participation  of  halflings alongside humans as raiders\nwho  were  used  by  the  city-state  of  Royvibobb  in  their  gambit to weaken their rivals.\nDespite  these  hostilities,  the  gnomes  did  trade  with  them  in  peacetime;  the  city  of\nPortnamm was founded as such a trading post.

As  tribes,  the  halflings  often  paid  tribute  to  the  various human tribes of\nLencenor,  such as the Lorenti peoples (the predecessors of Lorent) or under governance of\nthe  Gnomish  Hierarchy  (who did the same to their human neighbors too). Despite these\nlong-running  relationships,  most  halflings  generally  saw  this as something of a political\nnature  rather than race, and in times of peace halflings were protected and generally left to\ntheir own devices by their overlords.\n\nThere have been few occasions of halflings rising up against their non-halfling masters, and\nmost  have  combined  halfling  patriotism with nationalistic motivations to make a unified\nSmall  Country.  The  first  of  which was the Small Kingdom, which was a rump state of a\ncollapsing  Gnomish  Hierarchy.  While  dominated  and  led  by  halflings,  the  Kingdom\nactually  welcomed  fleeing  gnomes  into  their  lands,  who went on to form the industrial\nbackbone  of  the  fledgling  kingdom.

 page_events.623.d: "\nTraditionally,  Haraf’ne  society  has been made of various polities called Houses, or Kinah\nin  their  tongue.  Throughout  Haraf’s  history,  hundreds of Kinah have existed, each with\ntheir  own  identity and set of laws. Cannorians scholars have translated the term to “clan”,\nbut  the  reality is far more complex. Generally, Kinah can be divided into two groups: the\nGreat  Kinah  and  the  Minor  Kinah.  Recently,  after a centralization effort under House\nAlas’gasidi,  the  Kinah  system  has  broken down, with only House Alas’gasidi and House\nLeeti’haàt staying as modern political entities.\n\n== Kinah Federation ==\nThe  Kinah  have  been  unified multiple times under Kinah Federations, a political system\nwhere  the  individual  Kinah  govern their territory and determine their foreign policy with\nrelatively  low  oversight,  but  have  to  share  a yearly tithe of men and gold to the leading\nKinah,  as  well  as  obey  to their decrees. This kind of political system existed three times\nthroughout  Haraf’ne  history: the First Kinah Federation of House Duadir’iìlvitarn, which\nexisted  from  570 to 629, the Second Kinah Federation of House Hateil’ine, which existed\nfrom  931 to 934 and the Third Kinah Federation of House Alas’gasidi, which existed from\n1178 to 1731.\n\n== Great Kinah ==\nThe  concept of Great Kinah appeared with the unification of the First Kinah Federation in\n570.  To shape it to their grand visions, House Duadir’iilvitarn direly needed support from\nthe most influential Kinah. To do so, they were given special privileges and a foremost role\namong  the  Federation.  These  privileges  would define what a “Great Kinah” was and are\nstill important in Haraf. The most important of these rights were:\n\n- A seat in the Great Council to advise the Neàn’aanii, the Federation’s leader.\n\n-  A  small  retinue  of  elite  guards  to  protect  the  Kinah’s  chief.  These  would later be\nexpanded by House Alas’gasidi during their centralization efforts.\n"

A charismatic conqueror and philosopher, his empire would\nstretch  as  far  as Tianlou and he is responsible for the creation of several dynasties such as\nhis male line, The Divine Call, and the female line of the Ruby Garden. He is credited for\nthe  rapid  spread  of High Philosophy and helping the restructuring of the Rahenraj's caste\nsystem to place Harimari on top as administrators and lords.\n\n== Early Life ==\nMuch  of  Harimar's  early  life  is  unknown as the Harimari were only recently ascended,\nhaving   existed   for   10  years  before  Harimar's  birth.  Growing  up  in  the  Ascension\nPeninsula,  in  what  is  now  known as Harimar's Cradle, some sources claim him to have\nbeen  a  fighter,  others  more  of  a scholar since his childhood, though the truth is likely a\nmix  of  the  both. It would be during these early years he would have his son, Manava I of\nthe Divine Call.\n\nWhat  is known, is that at only the age of 25, in the year 35, Harimar was able to unify the\nlocal  Harimari  tribes  and  declare  his  intent  to  conquer Rahen, igniting the Rise of the\nHarimraj Wars against Rahen.\n\n== Conquests ==\nWithin  just 8 years, with western Rahen already under his control, Harimar would declare\nwar  on the kingdom of Yanhadesh in the year 43. In 6 years he would conquer the entirety\nof  the  kingdom,  leaving  him with all of Rahen and the upper-Yanhe under his control by\nthe   year   49.  Following  this  expansion  he  would  declare  his  empire  the  Harimraj,\nHarimar's Rule.\n\nConsolidating  his  lands,  it  wouldn't be until the year 60 that he would continue his wars\nagainst Haless. It is believed that during this time is when he sired the Lotus Sisters, taking\ntime  from  his conquests to raise them.

His  goal  was  to discover the truth behind the high\ntemples,  delving  into them as he traveled Haless to discover the meaning behind the High\nGods  and  the  way of life they followed. It would be in one of these temples that he would\nlose his left eye, earning him the title the One-Eyed Master of Rahen.\n\nWith  the  extent  of  his empire, Harimar would establish various states to rule Yanshen in\nhis stead, these states being administrated by the rising class of Eunuchs who would remain\ninfluential for over a thousand years post the empire's fall due to this.\n\nIn  the  same  years  he  conquered  Yanshen  his armies sweeped South Haless, conquering\nThidinkai,   and   nominally   controlling  the  Lupulan.

These  initial  conquests  were  infamous for the\nbestial   savagery   displayed   by  the  harimari  in  combat,  but  their  reputation  changed\ndrastically   as  Harimar  conquered  ever  more  land  and  adopted  a  policy  of  military\nintegration, cultural acceptance, and enlightened rulership. The humanoid tigers have since\nbecome  known  as highly cultured thinkers and philosophers - so much so, in fact, that the\nterm "philosopher-king" is said to have originated from the harimari rulers of Haless.\n\n===Etymology===\nThe  Harimari  derive  their  name  from  their legendary leader Harimar, the warlord who\nconquered   most   of   Haless   between   35AA  and  his  disappearance  in  70  AA.  The\nsarniryabsadi  language  denotes  something as belonging to a place or person by adding the\n“i” suffix to the owner - thus, Harimari literally translates as “Harimar’s People” or “Those\nwho belong to Harimar”.\n\nHarimar   is   noted   in   several   historical  writings  as  having  been  a  member  of  the\n“second-generation”,  and  not  one  of the original members of the species to gain sapience\nduring  the  Day  of  Ashen  Skies.  This  has raised questions as to what name the harimari\nreferred  to  themselves as before the great leader’s life - a lack of written records from that\ntime period has rendered this knowledge lost to history.\n\n==Origins==\nFor as long as the harimari have existed, there have been competing theories among Raheni\nand  Halessi  philosophers  of  how  such  a  people came into being. A handful of facts are\nwell-established:  they  did not exist prior to the Day of Ashen Skies, they are confirmed to\nexist  by  2  AA, and that Harimar the Great was a second-generation harimari. But details\nbeyond that are largely confined to the realm of theory, though some may have more weight\nthan others."

 page_events.2141.d: "\n\nAncient  oral tradition passed down in the jungles of the south speaks of the legendary "Eye\nof  Ascension",  an  artifact  through which the tiger progenitors of the harimari passed and\nemerged  as  sentient  beings.  The  logistics  of  such  a  process  are dubious, and no such\nartifact  has  been  recorded  in  any  of  the  Order of Chroniclers' expeditions, nor do the\nharimari  themselves  claim  to have access to such a portal. That said, given the volume of\nHigh  Temples in the region, and their incalculable depths, it is impossible to fully rule out\nthe idea that such an artifact exists.\n\nA  theory  more popular in recent history also points to the High Temples, and their strong\nspirit-manipulating  powers.  It  argues that the Day of Ashen Skies must have caused some\nsort of malfunction in Raheni temples, where instead of suppressing the local spirits of land\nand  sky,  they  were  channeled into physical vessels. For whatever reason, their receptacle\nwas  the  Ascension's  Peninsula  tiger  population,  and  the  product of being imbued with\nthose  quasi-sentient beings' essence resulted in the harimari. The knowledge transferred in\nthis process, it is argued, explains why the harimari did not behave with total bewilderment\nupon transformation from mere jungle beast.\n\n==Anatomy and physiology==\nHarimari are often described as bipedal tigers, and this description is not warrantless - like\ntheir  cousins,  harimari  are  large  cats  with  dark  vertical stripes on orange fur. Delving\ndeeper,  however,  would  reveal  massive  differences  in their musculoskeletal structure to\nsupport  bipedalism.  The legs, feet, spine, chest, and shoulders have all experienced major\nchanges,  and  in  many ways the harimari skeleton more closely resembles that of a human\nthan that of a feline.\n\nIn  the  case  of the skull, harimari jaws are less muscled than those of their tiger ancestors,\nwith smaller teeth. The sagittal crest is significantly reduced on the cranium, and their face\nis  slightly  flattened  and  points  downwards  more  due  to the orientation of the foramen\nmagnum  beneath  the  skull.  This  change  in  orientation  is  not  so prominent as that in\nhumans, and does not produce a true chin from the lower edge of the jaw."

Lack of true lips leaves some sounds unformable in the way\nhumans  can  -  n’s  and  m’s  are  made in the throat, while b and p approximates are made\nthrough alterations to v and f sounds. Harimari retain the earth-shattering roar of the tiger,\nwhich can be heard nearly 3 km away.\n\nThe  forearm  modifications  of  harimari  are  extensive  as  well. Though they retain their\nretractable  claws,  the  dewclaw  is  remodeled  to  oppose  the four main digits, which are\nsignificantly  lengthened.  The  metacarpals are molded to enable a smoother turning of the\nwrist  but  retain  significant strengthening for flexion and extension while suffering reduced\nab/adduction  capacity.  Together,  these  morphologies  provide the harimari with a strong\ngrasping  hand  that  enables  them  to  manipulate  both pen and sword with ease. It is less\ndexterous  than  that  of  humans,  however, making certain complex tasks difficult, and the\ndifferences that do exist make harimari much worse at throwing objects than humans are.\n\nThere  is  notable  sexual dimorphism between male and female harimari, with males being\nconsistently  taller  and  heavier.  Generally,  males  stand  between 190 to 230 cm tall and\nweigh  between 110 and 260 kg. Females vary in height between 160 to 200 cm and weigh\nbetween 70 and 172 kg.\n\n===Physical Capabilities ===\nHarimari  are  extensively  muscled  and  are  capable  of  great feats of strength and speed,\nparticularly  in  short bursts - harimari have been measured as being about to move 30 kph\nfrom  a dead start, and most are capable of lifting twice their body weight over their heads.\nRetaining  the  natural  claws and teeth of tigers, harimari are exceptionally dangerous even\nwhen  unarmed, and tales abound of their terror in warfare due to their incredible strength,\nspeed,  and  natural  weapons.  Like  tigers,  they are strong swimmers and have no natural\naversion  to  water,  are  capable  climbers,  and can make horizontal leaps of up to 20 feet\nwith ease."

Harimari will accent their natural scent with perfumes\nand  musks,  and  how  one  presents  themself  via  scent  is equally as critical as any other\naspect of fashion.\n\n===Color Variants===\nAs  with  tigers,  several  variants  on  the  normal  orange  coloration of harimari fur exist,\nthough  none  are  common.  White,  golden,  and  black  harimari  have been noted in the\nhistorical  record,  though completely black harimari are exceedingly rare and still display a\ndeeper, black-purple striping on their dark fur.\n\n===Life cycle===\nLike  most  felines,  female harimari have an estrous cycle and can only conceive at certain\ntimes of year, though these periods of fertility vary and are unlinked to any seasonal cycles.\nGestation  is  slightly  longer  than  for  humans,  ranging  from 290 to 330 days. Harimari\ntypically  give  birth to one offspring at a time, though twins and triplets are more common\nthan  in  humans.  Cubs  typically  weigh  from  3500  to  5600  g  at  birth,  and  are born\nsignificantly  more  precocial  than  human offspring, able to hold their heads up at time of\nbirth and crawl in a matter of weeks."

 page_events.2144.d: "\n\nFemales  harimari  reach  sexual  maturity  earlier  than  males, at between 9 and 12 years.\nMales typically reach sexual maturity at 12 to 15. Harimari females experience menopause\nbetween  45  and  50 years of age. Harimari can live to be over 100 years old, but (as with\nmost peoples across time) most have historically lived shorter lives.\n\n=== Diet and caloric requirements===\nHarimari are obligate carnivores, a trait inherited from the tiger ancestors. They are unable\nto  produce  certain  amino acids and vitamins found only in animal matter, with no known\nplant  substitutes.  While  they  do consume a variety of plants in their diets and are part of\nthe  rich  culinary  tradition  of  Rahen’s  various cultures, foregoing meat entirely begins to\ncause  ailments  within  a  week. Symptoms such as muscular weakness, disorientation, and\nlethargy  manifest  first,  followed  by hallucination, gum bleeding, and eventually multiple\norgan failure if an insufficient diet is maintained for a long period of time.\n\nBecause  of  their  significant  bulk,  harimari  have  higher daily caloric requirements than\nhumans, consuming on average 6000 calories per day.\n\n==Demography ==\nFor  their  recent  origin,  harimari  are widely distributed across Haless and its immediate\nsurroundings.  Though  their densest concentrations of population are found in the south of\nRahen,  the  harimari  diaspora  is  broad,  and they make up integral parts of communities\nacross Xianjie, Yanshen, Bomdan, and Thidinkai. Beyond Haless itself, small communities\nof  harimari  established  themselves  on  the eastern coast of Sarhal during the centuries of\ncross-cultural  exchange  and  trade  between Rahen and Melekmengi - the most notable of\nthese communities is the island enclave of Vandipha.\n\nThough  they  are  biologically  nearly  identical,  harimari  are divided culturally into four\ngroups:\n"

Rather  than being seen as\noutsiders,  Royal  Harimari  are  very  much  a  part  of the fabric of the Raheni cultures in\nwhich  they reside, and bring that cultural milieu with them to their diaspora population in\nSarhal  and  those  few who make their way across the Salahad to trade in Bulwar or further\nabroad.\n*Serene  Harimari  are  those  harimari  groups  who  followed  Harimar  to  Yanshen  and\nintegrated with those cultures instead of Raheni ways. Though far less numerous than Royal\nHarimari, they are also highly integrated with the societies in which they dwell.\n*Roaming   Harimari,   also  known  as  the  Itinerant  or  Wayfaring  Harimari,  are  those\npopulations  that  have  traveled  outside  of the traditional harimari strongholds of western\nand  northern Haless. Originally a name for those few who migrated to Thidinkai, the term\nalso came to apply to the Harimari of Vandipha and other far-flung populations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
 page_events.629.t: "Harimari Ascension 1 / 1"
 page_events.629.d: "\nThe  Harimari  Ascension was one of the events that coincided with the Day of Ashen Skies\nin  the  Year 1 in which the Harimari tiger-people were born. Most of its details are lost to\nhistory  and engulfed by myths, aside from that date (though records of harimari only begin\nin  2  AA,  so  some scholars claim it may have actually happened a year or two prior to the\nDay of Ashen Skies, or in the direct aftermath thereof.)\n\nThe  harimari  themselves,  along  with  many  adherents  to High Philosophy, attribute the\nAscension  to  the  legendary  "Eye  of  Ascension",  through  which  their tiger progenitors\npassed  and  emerged  as  sentient  beings.  That  said,  the  logistics  of  such a process are\ndubious,  and  no  such  artifact  has  been  recorded  in  any  of  the Order of Chroniclers'\nexpeditions,  nor  do  the  harimari  themselves  claim to have access to such a portal. That\nsaid,  given  the  volume  of High Temples in the region, and their incalculable depths, it is\nimpossible to fully rule out such an idea.\n\nA  theory  more popular in recent history also points to the High Temples, and their strong\nspirit-manipulating  powers.  It  argues that the Day of Ashen Skies must have caused some\nsort of malfunction in Raheni temples, where instead of suppressing the local spirits of land\nand  sky, they were ''channeled.'' For whatever reason, their receptacle was the Ascension's\nPeninsula  tiger  population,  and  the  product  of  being  imbued with those quasi-sentient\nbeings'  essence  resulted  in  the  harimari. The knowledge transferred in this process, it is\nargued,   explains   why   the   harimari   did   not  behave  with  total  bewilderment  upon\ntransformation  from  mere  jungle  beast.  It  may also explain, at least in part, why Rahen\ndoes not suffer quite the same level of spirit presence as eastern Haless.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

 page_events.632.d: "\nHarpies  are  a  humanoid  race  who  primarily  reside  in  the  eponymous Harpy Hills of\nBulwar,  with various ethnic groups existing across Halann. They are most notable amongst\nthe  races  of  Halann  for  being the only race to be mono-gendered, with all harpies being\nfemale.  Their  most  defining  physical characteristic is their wings, which grants them the\nunique  natural  ability  to  fly.  Other notable characteristics include having avian legs and\nwings,  including  feathers,  as  well  as  being described as possessing a terrifying, piercing,\near-splittingly loud screech that they often used as a tool of psychological warfare to reduce\nenemy morale and strike fear into their enemies hearts.\n\n==Origins==\nThe  first  recorded  instance  of  interactions  with harpies was from a text dated to around\n1159  BA,  which  warned  travelers  in  the  hills of Northern Bulwar of attacks by winged\nwomen.  This  was also the same year that Firanya, who according to some legends was the\nfirst  harpy,  proclaimed the creation of the Harpy Queendom. There is a lack of definitive\nevidence  verifying  their  existence  prior  to  1159  BA,  which had led to several theories\nregarding their origins.\n\n=== Cannorian ===\nAccording to Cannorian Mythology, the prevailing theory stated that Firanya was one of the\nSpawns  of  Agrados,  and  that  she  is  the  creator goddess of all harpies. This theory was\nnotably  used to classify harpies as a monstrous race to cannorians. Despite the contention,\nFiranya’s  appearance  as  the  first  recorded harpy in existence led many to believe there is\nsome  basis  to this theory. Similarly, bulwari theories also share the belief that Firanya was\nthe  first  harpy.  According  to Cannorian texts, in 817 BA Firanya was slain in battle by a\nbulwari human huntress, who was considered to be the human avatar of the hunter-goddess\nFalah.\n\nIn  the  1600s, famous genealogist Sendrian Bloodfollower proposed the theory that, due to\nharpies  being  able  to breed with elves they share a common biological ancestor with both\nelves  as  well as humans. In his ''Thesis on the Alleged Monsters of the World'' published\nin  1696,  he  states that the harpy race is in fact a degenerative variant of the Avariel - and\nthat  the  avariel  race were the progenitors of not just elves, but also harpies. As part of his\ntheory,  he  sought  to  disprove the celestial link between elves and angels through avariels,\nclaiming that angels were not related to elvenkind in any way."
 page_events.2146.t: "Harpy 2 / 8"
 page_events.2146.d: "\n\nIn   1833,   Jonathan   Hull,   an   Arannese   scholar   living   in  Brasan,  combined  both\nBloodfollower’s  theory  and  prevailing bulwari scholarly theory at the time. He supported\nBloodfollower’s  thesis  but  proposed  that  the  only  way for harpies to suddenly appear in\nnorthern  bulwar  would  have been through experimentation with planar magic. According\nto  him, Firanya was a God-King who accidentally opened a portal that summoned a group\nof harpies into her kingdom.\n\n=== Bulwari ===\nAccording  to  the  Bulwari  creation  myth,  the  harpies are the daughters of Nilšranu, the\ngoddess  of  the  wind  and  his  nephew  Surakel,  god  of gardening and order. The oldest\nsurviving  version  of the myth says that Nilšranu felt jealous of Surakel’s wives, so she used\nmagic to trick Surakel to lie with her.\n\nWhen  Surakel  became  free  of  the  spell, he pursued Nilšranu, who fled north, to a lake\nbetween the mountains. Fearing for his life and his future child, she pleaded with his father\nŠadru for protection from Surakel. The eldest of the gods, still holding a grudge against his\ngrandson, raised the lands between Surakel’s garden and the lake, creating the Šad Našratu,\nthe Harpy Hills. Safe from Surakel, Nilšranu gave birth to Firanya, the first of the harpies.\n\nDuring  the Early 18th century, a group of bulwari literary scholars, who notably shared an\ninterest  in  pre-Sun  Cult  bulwari  culture and beliefs, proposed a theory that Firanya was\none  of  the  ancient  God-Kings  of Bulwar, who ruled over a kingdom in the mountainous\nregion  north  of  the Suran and Buranun, today called the Harpy Hills. They theorized that\nshe  was  a young queen who inherited an enormous amount of power, and uttered a poorly\nworded  wish  that punished her foolishness by transforming her into the first harpy. While\nthe  exact  account has been highly dramatized, it had a massive impact on bulwari scholars\nwho maintained this as the leading theory regarding harpy origins for centuries, as well as a\ncultural  impact  on  bulwari  writers  and  artists  who would use Firanya’s foolishness as a\nsubject to discuss tales of hubris, lust, and youthful foolishness."

 page_events.2147.d: "\n\n==Harpy Reproduction==\nDue   to   their  unique  physical  nature,  harpies  require  mates  of  other  species,  most\ncommonly   humans,   in   order   to   reproduce.   Harpies   will  often  take  on  physical\ncharacteristics  of the race of their fathers. Repeated mating over several generations with a\nparticular   species   will   result   in  future  harpies  progressively  resembling  them,  also\ninheriting  their  unique  traits, a notable historic example being the Elayenna Harpies, who\nhaving  repeatedly  mated  with  the  Desert  Elves of the Jaddari Legion, were described as\nhaving  elven  features  such  as  slim  builds,  longer ears, and beautiful faces, especially in\ncomparison  to  their  Siadunan  counterparts  at  that  time.  This  also  slightly influences\nlifespan,  as harpies typically live up to 60-80 years for those with human fathers, and up to\n80-100 years for those with elven fathers.\n\nThoughts   regarding   the  nature  of  Harpy  Reproduction  have  been  varied  throughout\ncenturies,   with   harpies   notably   being  described  and  seen  as  rapacious,  man-eating\nmonsters,  especially  to  Cannorian  sources.  Modern  scholars have discredited this idea,\nowing  to  the  numerous  other factors that could affect historical interactions and views of\nharpies, alongside the testimony of hundreds of people of various races throughout history.\n\n== Appearance and Physical Nature ==\nPhysically,  Harpies  are  naturally  slender  and  have  a slimmer frame when compared to\nhuman women, however, they have a far greater muscle density when compared to humans,\nand as such are physically stronger. In regards to flight, several studies have concluded that\nthe back muscles of harpies are naturally well developed due to decades of supporting their\nown  weight,  and numerous historical and contemporary examples have shown that harpies\nare capable of carrying fully grown humans for several miles.\n\n==Degrees of Avianity==\nThe  degree  of  Avianity  was  determined  by  the amount of feathers a harpy had on their\nbody,  the  shape  of  their  face,  and  the  prominence  of  their  talons. Higher degrees of\navianity  were associated with having feathers covering close to or all of the arms and lower\nbody,  a  more  angular  face, and prominent talons. Historically, the degree of avianity was\nthe  defining  characteristic  used  by  Cannorians  to  establish  them  as a monstrous race.\nToday,   many  harpies,  especially  those  residing  outside  of  Cannor,  view  this  type  of\ncategorization as depersonalizing, archaic, and not suitable for the modern day."

 page_events.2148.d: "\n\n== Harpy Societal Structures ==\nHarpy Societies are broken down into three traditional fundamental units which, beginning\nfrom smallest to largest are: Flocks, Matriarchies, and Queendoms.\n\n*  A flock is the smallest of the three units which commonly comprise of anywhere from 50\nto  100  families,  living  for  extended  periods  of  time  in the same general area. During\nhistorical periods of migration, flocks will often fluctuate in size as some families choose to\nremain  in an area as others continue, or as new Harpies and their families decide to join a\nnew flock. Flocks are not based off of ethnic or geographic lines, and the primary means of\nbeing  accepted  into  a  flock  typically  only  require  a  show  of  submission  to a flock's\nMatriarch.  Historical  sources  do not regard individual flocks as their own "nations," and\nHarpies  do  not  typically  regard  flocks  with  the same rigidity as many often do with the\nconcept  of a nation. While new families can be included into a flock at anytime, generally\nfamilies within a flock claim to all be descendants of the same matriarch.\n\n* A Matriarchy is the second of the three units and comprises of a number of flocks that all\nadhere  and  accept  a  singular  Matriarch.  While  flocks  retain  their  own  matriarch,  a\nMatriarchy  is  unique  in  that  a  number of flock matriarchs accept the rule and lead of a\nsingle  matriarch,  oftentimes  the descendant of a famous historical matriarch, and thus all\nflocks will be included and "absorbed" into a broader Matriarchy while still retaining their\nown  nominal  flock  identity.  A  Matriarchy was historically the most commonly accepted\nform  of  hereditary  monarchy  that  constituted  a "nation" in diplomatic exchanges, both\nbetween Harpies and with other races.\n\n* A Queendom is the third of the three units and comprises a number of Matriarchies that,\nsimilarly   to  the  previous  unit,  adhere  and  accept  the  rule  of  a  singular  Matriarch.\nThroughout  history  there  have  been  4  historical  Queendoms, also referred to as Harpy\nQueendoms   or   colloquially  as  just  Harpylen.  Just  as  with  the  previous  units  each\nindividual   flock  and  each  matriarchy  still  retains  their  cultural  identity,  however  in\nQueendoms  the  ruling  Matriarchy will often restrict the power and influence of the other\nmatriarchies  in  an  attempt  to  consolidate power.While the Queendoms have often been\nreferred  to by outside sources as "empires" the concept of a "harpy empire" has only once\never  been  "achieved"  under Firanya, as both Firanyan and Siadunan Harpies consider an\n"empire"  to  mean  the  unification  of  either  all  Bulwari  Harpies, or of Harpykind as a\nwhole."

 page_events.639.d: "\nThe  Hebat  Hari  Chiefdom  is  one  of the many kingdoms of the Yanglam, located in the\nnorth  of  the  Lupulan.  It  is  known for dominating the Lupulan during the 13th century,\nsomething  that  happens  only a few times throughout the history of the Yanglam, although\nthey had only achieved this with aid from Baihon Xinh.\n\n==History==\n===Early History and Founding of the Kingdom===\nFounded  sometime  during  the  10th century by a Kaplakawan exile and his warriors who\nwere  on  the  losing  side  of a civil war, Hebat Hari originally didn't hold that name, only\ncalling  itself  by  its  capital,  Haristana. Up until the early 14th century, the kingdom was\nsimply  another  kingdom  amongst many dozens, until in 1410, Saoban Cang, Emperor of\nBaihon  Xinh  came  to  them,  looking  for  a way to assert dominance in the Lupulan. He\npromised  the  king  dominion  over  all  of  the  northern  Lupulan if he would become an\nautonomous  vassal  of  the  Emperor. The king accepted and a revolt by more conservative\nand  prideful  nobles  were quickly quashed by Baihon Xinh's military might. Saoban Cang\nkept  good  on  his  promise,  and  provided  soldiers  and better weapons, allowing for the\ntribesmen  to  conquer all of the northern Lupulan and even when the soldiers from Baihon\nXinh  left  having  fulfilled their part of the deal, the newly created kingdom of Hebat Hari\nwas  able  to  continue  conquering  by themselves, forcing almost all of the Yanglam in the\nLupulan to kneel and pay tribute.\n\n===Caksak Sajan's Rebellion===\nIn  1433,  just  a  few  years after Hebat Hari proclaimed dominion over all the Yanglam, a\nTlaga  chief  named Caksak Sajan found a malevolent and extremely powerful spirit, which\nhas  been  identified  as  the  Great  Spirit  Semat  Tidakhui,  imprisoned  in a statue at the\nbottom  of  Tlagapatung's  lake.  By  making  pacts  with  the  spirit,  Caksak  was  able to\nsuccessfully  lead  a  rebellion  against  Hebat Hari, inciting nearly every single one of their\nother   subjects   to   revolt.  Baihon  Xinh  moved  to  intervene,  but  the  dark  spirits  of\nTlagapatung  drove  them  back,  and  for  6  years  Hebataan and Baihon soldiers fought a\nlosing  war against the Rainforest Kings, made worse by growing instability in Baihon Xinh\nand the pirates of Pinghoi joining the war at the side of the rebels. Finally, in 1439 Baihon\nXinh   made  peace  with  the  rebels,  abandoning  their  vassals  to  fend  for  themselves.\nMiraculously,  Hebat  Hari  managed  to survive, though they were essentially back to their\nborders before their conquests."

The floods spare them the worst of their\nefforts,  and  the  populace  love  the  entertainment,  making  floods a time of celebrations\namongst the Hebataan instead of a time of trials.\n\n===Bombastic War Songs===\nIntroduced during the conquests of the Lupulan, the music of Hebat Hari is remarkable for\nits  fast  tempo and strong percussion, and the addition of metallic sounds creates a melody\nthat  is incredibly popular, not to mention loud.

Likewise, it is easy to ascend up and down -\neagles  provide  a route up, whereas large leaves allow for smooth glides downwards. Space\nis plentiful, and floods are rare.\n\n===Feasts for the Dead===\nIt  might  be  considered  strange and very unnecessarily costly that all royal heirs of Hebat\nHari are provided with generous pensions, which also strangely ends when any one of them\nascends  to  the  throne.  However,  these  are  actually well-planned failsafes. All pensions\ncome  directly  from  the  pockets of the king, and a significant pension is necessary. Upon\nthe  succession  of a new king, they must use this pension to organize and host a great feast.\nThis  practice  serves  to ensure a good-natured succession, likewise guaranteeing that there\nwill  be  no  spurned  phantoms  haunting  the  realm  as  they  do  in  nations  who dare to\ndisrespect  the dead. All are invited to this great feast, and no royal dares provide a sub-par\nexperience - for the memories of the revelers are very long."

Spreading east into Bomdan and Yanshen\nwith  the  harimari  diaspora, it was the dominant religion of the Raheni subcontinent until\nthe 16th-century saw it become a minority in its land of origin with the advance of the Jadd\nand  Godlost.

It is the\nduty  and honor of each individual to follow in the path that the High Gods left for mortals\n-  by following the rules and rituals laid out in the High Temples, one can achieve spiritual\nunity  (Purtara)  with  the  high  gods in their realm after death. The path is not necessarily\nthe  same  for  each individual, but it is only through Dekhana that one can determine their\nown  path  and  help others discover their own “moral way” (Nitikamarja) - for this reason,\ndebate and discussion are sacred in High Philosophy.\n\nPhilosophical  schools  vary  in  their  interpretation of Kartya, the relative importance and\n'canonicity'  assigned  to  various  texts,  and  their  specific teachings and practices. While\nthere  is broad disagreement on the Kartya that must be followed to achieve Purtara, beliefs\ncommon   across   most  sects  include  honesty,  moderation,  patience,  nonviolence,  and\ncompassion.  The  definitions of these ideals are among the most fiercely debated topics by\nHigh Philosophy theologians.\n\n=== High Temples ===\n\nScattered  across  Haless, the monolithic and enigmatic High Temples are the Holy Sites of\nDarsanasara.  Believed  to  have  been  constructed  by  the  High Gods before the dawn of\nhuman  civilization,  the  temples  are  sprawling  complexes  that  extend  both deep below\nground  and  up  towards  the heavens. Every high temple is different in size and shape, and\ntheir distribution across the continent is not uniform - many are found at high points in the\nlandscape, but others are lost deep beneath choking jungle canopies while others lounge on\nthe  shoulders of broad rivers. Their labyrinthine halls and grounds are filled with etchings,\nmurals,  and  friezes  of  various  scenes  of the High Gods - their conquest of the land, the\ncivilization  they  built,  their  many  legends  and  tales and battles with each other and the\nprimordial  forces  of  the  world.  Deeper  within  the temples, many rooms are hidden or\ntrapped  to prevent further entry - presumably because the High Gods did not trust mortals\nwith all of their secrets."

That the high gods have left the\nworld  to  the  people  of  Haless  as  a test, to see if there will be those who can rise to the\nsame  heights  of  glory  and  wisdom  as  they once did, and that the answers to the myriad\nquestions  of  the  world  can  be  found hidden in the wisdom of the temples. As such, the\ntemples  are  sites  of  academic and spiritual activity, as scholars gather to discern, discuss,\nand  dissect  the messages that hold the key to joining the High Gods in their eternal realm\nafter death.\n\n== The High Gods ==\nThe  builders  of  the  High  Temples,  the  enlightened  High  Gods  are the patrons of the\nRaheni  and  the  givers  of  wisdom,  who  provided  a  path  for all to join them in eternal\nenlightenment.  Unlike  in  classical  Devimarja,  most  schools of High Philosophy do not\nadvocate  for  the  direct  worship  of  the  High Gods; instead, they are seen as benevolent\nteachers who provided guidance on the ways for every person to live the best possible life.\n\nThe  High  Gods  are  related  to  various  occupations,  tasks,  and castes. While there are\ndozens  of  individuals  represented  in  the  artworks  of  the  High  Temples, the ten most\nconsistently  shown  in  each temple are seen as the chiefs of the pantheon, with the various\nminor gods parts of their families or entourages. They are:\n\nAnjita:  High  God  of  warriors, Bearded Anjita is depicted as a tall and stern man dressed\nfor  battle,  a  shining  blade  in his hand and a great bow on his back. He is often depicted\ndriving   back  monsters  from  his  chariot,  defending  the  land  and  making  it  safe  for\ncivilization. He appears in many friezes alongside Dipar, Nermali, and Vadhan.\n\nDigatha:  High  God  of  sailors,  Digatha  the Horizon Walker is depicted as a bright eyed\nwoman  with  a  halo  of light around her head and an open map in one hand. Often shown\nexploring  deep jungles or aboard great ships, Digatha is a master of wind and water, saving\nsailors  from  disaster  and  bringing  forth  the  bounty  of  the  sea.  Usually  appears with\nVachava or by herself in murals."

 page_events.2159.d: "\n\nDipar: High God of judges, Clear-eyed Dipar is among the most universally revered of the\nhigh  gods.  He  is  shown  with  a  shaved head and a necklace of gleaming stars. He is the\narbiter  of  the  heavens, who passes fair judgment and advises his companions. He is often\nseen working with Gunjit and Pathim to create the high temples, or with Anjita and Simral\nplanning the conquest of the land.\n\nGunjit:  High  God  of  crafters,  Gunjit of the Hammer is the master of forge. He is often\ndepicted  bare  chested,  his long hair in a topknot. He appears to have made Anjita’s blade\nand  many of the other objects wielded by the high gods, and much of the machinery of the\nHigh Temples. He often appears in association with Jaghut, Pathim, and Dipar.\n\nJaghut:  High  God  of  artists,  Jaghut  the  Maker  is the master of writing, sculpting, and\npainting, and is believed to have been the one who created the many murals within the high\ntemples.  He  is  shown as a long-haired man covered in arm bracers and carrying a stylus.\nOften shown alongside Gunjit and Simral.\n\nNermali:  High  God  of  healers,  Nermali  the Preserver is usually represented as a figure\nwith  a  gleaming hand and a necklace of snakes. She is the master of medicine, magic, and\npoisons, and is often shown with Vadhan, Simral, and Anjita.\n\nPathim:  High  God  of  builders,  Pathim the Creator is credited as the builder of the high\ntemples  and  many  other great works of Haless, carving the landscape that is known today.\nShown  often  as  a squat woman with a chisel. She is often shown alongside Dipar, Gunjit,\nand Vadhan.\n\nSimral:  High  God  of  scholars,  Simral  Moon-browed  carries a great tome and a chain.\nOften shown with Jaghut, Dipar, and Nermali.\n\nVachava:  High  God  of merchants, Vachava is usually shown on horseback and carrying a\ngreat  staff  with  a  bag strapped to the end. Decorated in gold and silver, she appears near\nmines and brings gifts and messages to the other gods. She is often shown alongside Jaghut,\nGunjit, and Digatha."

 page_events.2160.d: "\n\nVadhan:  High  God  of  farmers, Vadhan the Life-giver carries a spade and a bag of seeds,\nand  is  responsible  for  sewing  the forests and cultivating the fields of Haless. He is often\nshown alongside Anjita, Pathim, and Nermali.\n\n== Schools of Thought ==\nThough  there have been many schools that have risen and fallen in popularity and practice\nover  the  millennia  since High Philosophy became the dominant religion of Haless, seven\nmajor orthodox schools predominated in 1444.\n\nAscendant  Soul:  "The  School  of  the Ascendant Soul has its roots in the traditions of the\nRighteous  Path,  and  is  a syncretization of Raheni and Yan beliefs. Scholars of this school\nargue that the relics left behind by the High Gods were only able to be erected by beings of\nincredible  discipline and power - the deeds depicted in the friezes of the High Temples are\nfar  beyond  the  ken  of mortals today. To become like the high gods, one must master and\nimprove  all  aspects  of  the  self  -  physical,  mental,  magical,  and spiritual. Power over\noneself,  over  one’s abilities, grants one the power to shape the world and become a worthy\ninheritor  of  the  wisdom and world of the High Gods. With both power and wisdom, one\ncan  achieve  Purtara  and  join with the High Gods spiritually. The Ascendant soul believe\nthis  joining does not have to come only after death, but that those who become masters, or\nAscendants,  are  joined  with the High Gods in life, and thus have a sliver of their wisdom\nto impart to the world."\n\nGolden  Palace:  A conservative school that dominates the courts of the Dhenbasana plain,\nThe  scholars  of  the  Golden Palace believe that Order is the essence of the lessons of the\nhigh  gods.  Their  temples, murals, and relics are precisely chosen and placed for maximal\neffect,  each  scene a perfect lesson, each relic a mathematically perfect construct. This has\nled  to the conclusion that every person must have a defined place in the world and work to\nbe  the  greatest  they  can  within  that  role.  As such, the Golden Palace promotes a rigid\ninterpretation   of   the   ancient  Raheni  Caste  System,  and  teaches  that  through  one's\nadherence to their caste the spirit gains will eventually achieve Purtara."
 page_events.2161.t: "High Philosophy 5 / 8"
 page_events.2161.d: "\n\nOrange  Sash:  Named  for the traditional garment of the father of the family in Rahen, the\nOrange  Sash  school  believes  that  one’s ultimate duty is to the family, regardless of caste,\nposition  or  country.  They  point  to  the  clear  indications that the High Gods worked in\nfamily  units,  with lesser gods serving their parents and grandparents, and that only when a\nfamily  was  in internal harmony could the various High Gods work together to create their\ngreatest  works.  In  this view, the structure of society must be built around a strong family,\nobedient  to  their  elders,  who  focus  first  and foremost on ensuring their needs are met.\nEach  family must then work with their immediate neighbors to create a functioning society\nwhere  the  family heads can decide on needed policy. By serving the family and working to\nenlarge  and  spread  the  family  across  society,  one ensures society prospers and properly\npursues  Kartya.  Orange Sash views on the caste system tend to be highly flexible based on\nthe  needs  of  the  family  and  community,  but  they have strict views on gender roles and\nobligations of parenthood one must meet to achieve Purtara.\n\nSilk  Turban:  Their  symbol,  the traditional dress of the wealthy elite of the subcontinent,\nthe  Silk  Turban school believe primarily that the accumulation of wealth and beauty is the\nmost  favored  path  of  the  high  gods.  Noting  the incredible aesthetic appeal of the high\ntemples,  the  obvious  wealth  invested  in  their creation and the great fortunes of the high\ngods  shown in many of their murals, the silk turban suggests that the creation of prosperity\nis  itself  the  Nitikamarja.  This  wealth  is not supposed to be hoarded, but invested - into\npublic   works,   art   works,  gifts  for  friends  and  peace  offerings  to  enemies.  By  the\naccumulation  of  wealth  and  generous application of that wealth on noble causes, the silk\nturban believes that the fortune of the whole community is lifted and one proves themselves\nworthy of Purtara. "\n\nRadiant  Sun:  Originating  in  the  years following the Jaherian conquests, the Radiant Sun\nschool  is  heavily  influenced  by  the  Bulwari Sun Cults. Unlike other major schools, the\nRadiant  Sun emphasizes the importance of worshiping the high gods, of organized religious\nritual,   and   penance   for   deviation  from  the  Nitikamarja.  They  point  to  the  many\nceremonies   depicted   in   the  high  temples  as  proof  that  the  High  Gods  themselves\nunderstood  the  importance  of faith, and that faith must be a part of Purtara. They believe\nperforming  such  rituals  as  they have gleaned from the High Temples will draw the aid of\nthe  gods,  who  still  watch  over  mortals and want them to succeed. By proving oneself to\nbelieve  in the high gods through ritual, one can bring prosperity to the land and set one on\na straight path to Purtara in death."
 page_events.2162.t: "High Philosophy 6 / 8"
 page_events.2162.d: "\n\nStarry  Eye:  Philosophers  adhering  to  the  school  of the Starry Eye believe that the High\nGods  watch  mortals  from their hall in the stars, sending new signs from the movement of\ncelestial  bodies  for  those  wise  enough to interpret them. The gods reached the stars and\nmade   their   home   there  via  paths  revealed  to  them  after  they  found  true  spiritual\nenlightenment.  The  Starry Eye believe that all should be ever searching for enlightenment\nin  order  to  join the high gods, and believe that enlightenment requires a three-fold path -\ninner   knowledge,   group   knowledge,  and  outer  knowledge.  Meditation,  debate,  and\nobservation  of  the  world  are  equally important to gaining this enlightenment. Starry Eye\ngatherings are often caste agnostic and set outside at night, featuring star-gazing, discussions\nabout  potential  ways  to  become  enlightened,  meditation  circles,  and  education  of the\nuninitiated.\n\nUnbroken  Claw: The School of the Unbroken Claw believes that skill of arms is the most\nimportant  aspect  for  walking  in  the  path  of the high gods. Countless scenes in the high\ntemples  show  the  High God’s mastery of war - their fights against creatures of primordial\ndarkness, their domination of the skies and seas, the world shaping magic that they wielded\nto  build  the high temples - and the Unbroken Claw believe that one must seek to emulate\nthese  deeds  to  achieve  Nitikamarja.  Strength  and dominance - over one’s subordinates,\none’s  enemies,  -  these  are  the  ways  in  which  one  follows  the  path  of the high gods.\nUnbroken  claw  adherents believe in defending the prosperity of one’s community, in strict\npatron-client  relations  between  various  members of society, and that all should drill with\nweapons and train for war and battle.\n\n== Death and Afterlife ==\nHigh  Philosophy does not espouse a belief in an afterlife separate from this world - rather,\nif  one  has  not lived a sufficiently righteous life in keeping with Kartya to achieve Purtara,\nthe soul persists on this world until it can achieve Pradhana by walking to the conclusion of\nthe  Nitikamarja. Many souls can become lost on this path and come to torment mortals in\ntheir  despair  of  reaching  Purtara,  but  those  who offer advice to mortals and encourage\nthem  along their own paths will eventually find that their road too has come to an end and\njoin in unity with the High Gods."
 page_events.2163.t: "High Philosophy 7 / 8"
 page_events.2163.d: "\n\nThere  is  disagreement  among  scholars  as  to  whether Purtara is a state that involves the\nannihilation  of  the  self  or  a distinct continuation of consciousness in the presence of the\nhigh  gods.  While  all  agree  that  the realm of the High Gods is a place where the soul is\njoined with all others in communion and harmony, the nature of this joining has been hotly\ndebated,  with scholars of the Ascendant Soul and Unbroken Claw schools fervent believers\nthat  the  self  persists  after death, while standard Golden Palace and Radiant Sun theology\nstates  the  self  ceases  to  be  such  when joined with all others. Other disagreements stem\nfrom  the  location of the High Gods and what such unity implies - whether the soul passes\ninto another realm or a hidden location in this one is not settled doctrine.\n\n== Atma and the Soul ==\nHigh  Philosophy  views  Chi, called “Atma'' in Sarniryabsadi, as the manifestation of one’s\nspiritual  balance  along the narrow path of Nitikamarja. All things are possessed of Atma -\nthere  is  atma  of the one (svayatma), as well as atma of the collective (tamatma) and atma\nof  the world (visvatma) - and imbalances of Atma are seen as the leading causes of natural\ndisasters and personal maladies.\n\nBalancing  a  person’s  Atma  is dependent on following an appropriate Kartya and fulfilling\nthe  obligations  of  moral  existence.  As  one’s  kartya  was  often  intermixed  with  social\nstanding  and  caste,  the exact methods for balancing Atma were related to one’s obligation\nto  their  community,  dependents, and superiors. Behaving immorally would damage one’s\natma  and  was  believed  to  have  a  negative effect on the physical and mental state of the\nindividual  and  those  they  interacted  with,  while  those  with  more  productive positive\ncharacter  traits  were  viewed  as  having  great  Atma.  As  one’s atma was a result of their\nadherence  to the Nitikamarja and kartya, it was always within their power to generate good\natma and improve the self and the world.\n\nThe  atma  of  the  collective,  tamatma,  is  maintained,  and  represented, by the rulers of\nnations,  with  strong  rulers  bringing balance, and bad rulers bringing turmoil, rebellions,\nand general unrest to their lands."

At the heart of the temples are a temple "heart", a core\nof  pure damestear which in itself was often sought by pilferers, though with its removal the\ntemple would in turn cease functioning as a spirit suppressant.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Ancient History ===\nThe   exact   date  of  the  High  Temples  creation  is  unknown  but  to  the  cultures  and\ncivilizations  of Haless and Rahen they have always been there. These High Temples shaped\nHigh  Philosophy  as  it  is known today, the predominant religion of Rahen both in ancient\ntimes  and  today.  Believing  these  High Temples to be structures left behind by their gods\nthey  revered them, since then relics have been discovered leading many to believe that they\nin  fact  were  built  by  Precursors, though followers of High Philosophy do deny this even\ntoday.\n\n=== Harimar's Quest ===\nIn  fact,  this  concept  of  the  temples being structures left by the gods was radicalized and\nbrought  to  the forefront of the religion by Harimar the Great and his conquests of Rahen.\nUniting  the  Harimari  people at the age of 25, Harimar sought to both expand his empire\nand  seek  out all the High Temples left behind by the gods. Seeking to emulate these High\nGods, Harimar brought about the idea that the secrets could be found within these temples\nand  they  were  sacred structures. By studying them they sought to figure out how the High\nGods  lived  their  lives  and  perhaps  they  then  could do the same. When faced with the\nconquest  of  Thidinkai part of Harimar's reasoning for abandoning the struggle to conquer\nit was due to the apparent absence of High Temples. Ultimately Harimar, after conquering\nnearly  the entirety of Haless, would enter the High Temple of Tianlou in 79 AA and never\nbe seen again."

 page_events.2165.d: "\n\n=== Jaher's Invasions ===\nThe  High  Temples would continue to play a role in the developing civilizations of Haless,\nthough  many  others  did  not  see  them  as  objects  of  reverence  like followers of HIgh\nPhilosophy  did.  In  fact,  followers of the Lefthand Path such as the Oni of Azjakuma saw\nthem  as  a  font of knowledge to corrupt and others such as followers of the Mystic Accord\nin  the  Lupulan  ignored them altogether which left many turning derelict and ruined. The\nnext major event concerning them would occur during Jaher's invasions of Haless where he\nfirst  brought  about  the  idea  that  the Precursors built the temples and they were of elven\norigin. This outraged the people of Haless and brought about one more reason they wished\nto see him deposed.\n\n=== Rending of Realms ===\nThe  temples  would once again rise to the center stage of Rahen just before and during the\nRending  of  Realms.  With  the  invention  of  the  Korashi drill, capable of destroying the\nprotective  warding  of  the  temples, The Command's allowance of Oni custodianship over\ntheir  temples,  and  the  wear  of time it spelled a disaster for the temples. In the early late\n16th  century  and  early  17th  century Cannorian adventurers and fortune-seekers flooded\nHaless  seeking  the  wealth  to  be  gained by looting the temples of their relics and hearts,\nusing  the  ever-improving  Korashi  drills  to  do  so.  Meanwhile,  The  Command which\nrapidly  expanded  over  Rahen  and Haless granted the temples to the Oni, unknowing that\nthey'd  be  corrupting  them  and  rendering  them  also  defunct.  In  other  places such as\nThidinkai  and  Lupulan the temples merely degraded over time, increasing spirit presence.\nThis  culminated  in  Smaraya's  fall  in  the  Typhoon  of  Broken Vases in 1699/1700 and\nTianlou  in  1750, where a local rich man's son who gambled away his money hired a party\nand a drill to raid the temple. The fall of these two broke Tughayasa's warding and resulted\nin  the  Rending  of  Realms,  destroying  the  spirit  grid.  With  the  Rending temples that\nweren't  totally  defunct  were  often  repaired to attempt to restore it but those that already\nhad their hearts removed or stopped working were unable to be repaired.\n"

As  shown  in  the  map  these  domains are spread throughout Haless and several\nspirits  are  often  part  of larger pantheons.

His efforts spanning the\nsummer,  as Moguwon prepared the next phase in Gerunanin, news came that a great relief\narmy   from  Sir  had  marched  north  to  fight  him  and  keep  him  from  their  borders.\nMoguwon's  initial forces skirmished with Sir and reported back that the army consisted of\n14000   Yansheni   soldiers  from  Bianfang  sent  to  aid  Sir  by  their  MonarchToronami\nSaikochi, "The Shamakhad Campaign"."

Refusing to give up the siege, the boars found themselves unable to go on\nthe  offensive for a final push into the city. With their foes skirmishing their foraging forces\nand  threatening  an  attack  into  the rear, when Moguwon's call to reinforce him came the\nBoar  Marshal  broke the siege.

Pursuing  their  foe,  the  Command  forced a battle at Ghilapur Crossing,\nwhere they showed exceptional knowledge of concealment and river warfare by catching the\narmy  while part of it was attempting to cross. Rather than defend their allies, the Bianfang\nforces  succeeded  in  crossing first and, realizing the cause was lost, abandoned the princes\nof Sir, marching away mostly intact but condemning the Great Princedom to destruction."

It  inevitably  became  a  hub  for  all trade across the Dwarovar, with all roads\npassing through which let both goods and information come and go from every reach of the\nSerpentspine.

The Basalt Dwarves were\nfamous  for  their  production  of  darkened  glass  and  obsidian  artwork, as well as Basalt\nwhich  was  used  in  much  of  the  architecture  of  the  hold.  The  Basalt  Dwarves were\nisolationist  and  individualist,  not  allowing  Arg-Ôrdstun  to subjugate them like they did\nwith the rest of the Serpentreach, leading to a rivalry between the holds.\n\n==Geography==\nThe  Hold  of  Gor  Bûrad  is  located on the eastern end of the Serpentreach range. It was\nbuilt  around  the  magma  chamber of a great volcano, where the basalt dwarves harnessed\nthe  intense  heat  and  magma to create glass and obsidian in ''Ghelebûr Krakdhûm'', also\nknown  as  the  Fireglass  Forge.  The  former product led to a long rivalry with the nearby\nhold of Orlghelovar, which also exported glass but with higher quality & prices.\n\n==Culture and customs==\nBasalt  Dwarves  were  stereotyped  as short-tempered, suspicious of outsiders and quick to\nfight.  Legend  says that this is because the foundations of the hold were built on the corpse\nof  a  Fire  Giant.  However,  the  Basalt  Dwarves  themselves  taught  that they were once\nrefused  aid by the other dwarves during a terrible famine, and that this is what started their\nanger  and  isolationism.  The  Basalt  Dwarves  had  an exception as they traded with Gor\nDûrgheled,  supplying  them  with raw obsidian which enhanced their rune magic, allowing\nfor friendly relations to form between both holds.\n\nThe  most  famous  Basalt  Dwarf  tradition  is  the  ''Borbordûz'',  or  "Fire  Duel". This\nconsisted  of  settling  disputes  by fighting each other on platforms above a lake of magma.\nThe  intense  heat from the molten rock below, combined with the volcanic gases rising up,\nmade the bouts a grueling test of skill and endurance. As many contestants lost out of sheer\nexhaustion as those who were actually bested in battle.\n\nA  renowned  legend  describes  the longest Borbordûz ever: three nobles fought for a week\nstraight  to  decide  who would rule the hold, yet it should be noted that most Basalt Dwarf\npolitical  successions  did  not occur in this way. The fighters were called Storum the Stern,\nAdar Moonreacher and Magni the Vindictive. In the end, Magni was the only survivor and\ntook his place as ruler of Gor Bûrad.

The Obsidian Dwarves used this blood\nrune  magic  to  fight  the attacking precursors, which was unstable and caused the death of\nboth   precursors  and  dwarves.

The Topaz Dwarves\ndid  not  begin  the  construction  of  the hold with a specialisation in mind unlike much of\ntheir  contemporaries,  yet  they  developed  a martial society due to the dire circumstances\nthey  found  theirselves  in.

It grew from a trading outpost for merchants travelling from the Jade Mines\nto  Seghdihr,  and  as  such  had the character of the myriad peoples who passed through its\nhalls.  From  its  humble  origins,  this hold at the boundary of where East meets West had\ngrown  to  be  a mighty and elegant fortress catering the likes of the wealthiest Goldlords of\nVerkal Gulan to the humblest of wholesalers from Seghdihr.\n\nWhile  Gor  Ozumbrog  was  never  as  great as the high jewels of the Dwarovkron such as\nArg-Ôrdstun,  Seghdihr,  or  Grônstunad,  it  was  just  as  significant  in  the  eyes  of  the\nSegbandal.  Originally  founded to bridge the gap between Ovdal Kanzad and the wealth of\ngold  in  Verkal Gulan, the Topaz Dwarves take their name from the topaz, a gemstone that\ncomes  in  many  colours,  from  a  colourless  jewel akin to diamond, to a pale blue of the\ndesert  sky seen from the gates of Seghdihr or Verkal Gulan, to the yellow brown of amber.\nA  stone  that shifted between colours and is harder than may appear, a stone to reflect their\nown  purpose, and remind them of it. It was their duty to guard the path, and so they stood\nstalwart.\n\nGor  Ozumbrog  was  only  thought  of  as a proper hold after the fall of Amldihr, and with\ntheir  founding in a time of such strife, every dwarf was called to serve in the defence of the\nSegbandal.  Men,  women  and  even  the youngest of dwarves were called to take up arms,\nexperiencing  none  of  the  luxury  and splendor that the elites of other holds held so dear.\nGor  Ozumbrog  was  born  in  a  time  of  blood,  and  spent its formative years defending\noutposts  on  the  Copper  Road  and  garrisoning  Gor Vazumbrog against the orc menace.\nTheir  identity  was  rooted in struggle, their regalia outfitted with topaz matching the gems\nof  their  allied  holds,  allowing  them  to fit in any clan’s ranks. The Topaz Dwarves knew\nthey  wouldn’t  gain  as  much  glory  and  renown  as  the  armies of the Segbandal, but the\nSegbandal always remembered their sacrifices for the Middle Dwarovar."

The Seg Band set down the\nDwarovrod to Gor Ozumbrog, and when it arrived, demanded that the hold submit itself to\nthe  authority  of the Phoenix Empire and turn over King Ombrindal for punishment. With\nKing  Ombrindal  and  a  significant  portion  of  the  Hold’s  armed forces out clearing the\nCopper  Road,  the  holds  remaining defenders denied the demands as they settled in for a\nlong  siege,  hoping  beyond hope that their king returns before the enemy could do serious\ndamage to the hold.\n\nThe  Seg  Band’s  decision  to  bring  elven  magi  was  the  chief  nail in the coffin for Gor\nOzumbrog.

It  was  determined that the best option was to\nsimply  do  as  much  damage to the hold that they could, and so ordered an all out assault,\nwith full allowance for pillage.\n\nThe Sack of Gor Ozumbrog was some of the most devastating violence in Dwarven history,\nwith the Seg Band themselves encouraging levels of violence and behavior in the soldiers of\nthe  rest of the armies that many would in time regret. The damage however was done, and\nmany  valuables  are  stolen  from  their  owners-  living  and  deceased.

Even as the cinders of\nAul-Dwarov  faded  away,  the  Jade  Dwarves  never  lost  sight  of  the  vibrance  that  life\nprovided.\n\nWhilst  most  of  the  dwarves  were  quick  to  largely seal themselves off from the outside\nworld,  the  Jade  Dwarves  instead  saw  it  as  an  opportunity  to  grow and become more\nsuccessful,   and  as  such,  the  Grônrod,  or  Jade  Road,  was  born.  However,  the  new\nexpansion led to a swathe of hobgoblin infested territory that the Jade Dwarves had to carve\na  path through before opening the exploration of Shamakhad and beyond. Eventually these\nexplorers  discovered  the  mountains  in  the  Phokhao  Range  to  the southeast, rich with\npotential tin deposits, and settlers were sent to both mine and construct a new hold in these\nunknown  lands  far  from the Dwarovar. This was the birth of the Hold of Verkal Ozovar,\nwhich  ran  itself autonomously while aiding the East Serpentspine with resources. It began\nsmall, later spreading its influence among the humans who lived beyond their gates, sharing\nknowledge  and  institutions  with  them  and  in  exchange,  asking  the humans to be their\nvassals.  Their  influence  spread  further  from  the  hold as their vassals expanded, leaving\nlasting dwarven influence in the region.\n\n== Notable Locations ==\n\n=== Vûrdriz-Ândriz ===\nVûrdriz-Ândriz is the extension of the main hold of Grônstunad similar to the extensions of\nthe  main hold of Amldihr. It is connected by the Dwarovrod Railway and was notably used\nto  shelter  the  miners who ventured to the Range of the Damned to where they mined Tin\nfrom."

Due to proximity to front lines, the hold of Gor Vazumbrog\nwas placed under martial law and attempts were made to break through to Hul-Jorkad.\n\nIn  5989 BA, Orrin IX raised a large army consisting mainly of troops from the Jade Mines\nholds  and  started  sending them into the Middle Dwarovar, starting to try and dig through\nthe blockades of the Tunad. Meanwhile, he sent messenger convoys towards Amldihr to get\nan idea of how the west was faring.\n\n====Centralisation of Power====\nThe  push  towards  Hul-Jorkad  had  progressed very slowly, partially hampered by lack of\nrailroad  maintenance  slowing  down supplies from the east. In 5963 BA, in order to unify\nthe  war  effort,  Grônstunad  took  steps  to  institute a proper chain of command over the\nholds  of  the  east,  which  was  met with some resistance by powerful dwarven clans of the\nMiddle  Dwarovar,  who  had  been  pulling  power  towards  themselves  with  the  central\nauthority from Amldihr gone.\n\n====Proclamation of the Jade Empire====\nSoon  after  the  fall  of  Amldihr  in  5895  BA,  Grônstunad  declared  itself  overlord  of\nAul-Dwarov  and  declared  the  West  lost,  establishing  the  Jade  Empire  in  5887  BA.\nOutraged  at  being  passed  over,  many  of  the  holds  of the Middle Dwarovar refused to\nacknowledge the proclamation, and severed ties with Grônstunad. The holds of the Tree of\nStone  however,  tired  of  the  constant  warfare, accepted the proclamation and joined the\nJade  Empire.  Gor  Ozumbrog  and  Ovdal  Kanzad,  the  holds of the Segbandal and Jade\nEmpire  that  were  closest  to  the  border,  still  maintained  close  ties despite the hostile\nrelations of their overlords."

With the best and brightest dwarves of the\neastern  holds  moving  to the capital, Grônstunad was expanded and improved greatly, and\nthe outlying Vûrdriz-Ândriz expanded along with it.\n\n====The Forays past Vûrdriz-Ândriz====\nA  number  of attempts were made to crack open passages to the north of Vûrdriz-Ândriz in\n3784  BA,  to  explore  the  caverns  below  the  mountains  there.  The hope was to find a\nsuitable  location  for  the creation of a new hold, from where the plentiful tin in the region\ncould  be  mined.  Tin had been relatively rare in the east, and with the Western Dwarovar\nlost, initial mapping efforts were quite optimistic, noting the near absence of goblins there.\nSoon,  however,  they  found  out  the reason for this. The caverns were frequently home to\nseismic  activity,  which  made  building there extremely difficult. What was more, caverns\nregularly  collapsed,  formed,  and shifted, making mapping them virtually impossible. The\nmountains were then named the Range of the Damned, and these plans were abandoned.\n\n====The Construction of Verkal Ozovar====\nAfter  several fruitless attempts to find a suitable location within the Range of the Damned,\nscouts  were  sent  out  towards  other  mountain  regions  in  the  vicinity  of  Grônstunad.\nEventually,  a location within the Phokao Range was found, and construction of the hold of\nVerkal   Ozovar   commenced   in   3500  BA.  Because  of  the  distance  between  it  and\nGrônstunad,  most of the necessary materials were obtained locally, and the colony was run\nmostly autonomously.\n\n===Fall of the Jade Empire===\n"

While  none  of  the  holds were attacked head-on, they were all de facto under\nsiege,  as  they  could  barely  reach  any of the other holds. As it became apparent that the\nTree  of  Stone  holds  were  unable  to regain control over the Dwarovrod by themselves, a\nmassive  army  led  by  general  Dourban  Brightbrow  was  rallied in Grônstunad to regain\ncontrol over the Tree of Stone in 2474 BA.\n\nAs  the jade army entered the Tree of Stone, Grimka sent emissaries to the hobgoblin clans\nin  the Jade Mines and on the surface, proposing a united front against the dwarves in 2472\nBA.

Dourban Brightbrow ordered his forces to prepare\nfor   a  surface  journey  towards  Grônstunad,  however,  when  king  Grongnir  of  Hul-az\nKrakazol  heard  this,  he laughed in his face and called it the cowardly route. Wounded in\nhis  pride,  Dourban  ordered  his  troops  to instead move through the Dwarovrod in 2466\nBA.  As  they  attempted  to  move  through  the  tunnel towards the Jade Mines, they were\nambushed  by a large force of goblins and hobgoblins, in what eventually turned into a long\nsiege as the jade army dug itself into a defensive position in the tunnel."

Almost  immediately, the clans taking part in the siege started to fight\namongst  themselves  over  leadership  of  the  goblintide.  As  news  spread, the goblintide\ndisintegrated  as the many clans fell back into their old rivalries. The hobgoblins, however,\nremained united in their attacks against the Jade Empire.\n\n====The Nephrite Expedition====\nBeing  informed  by  Peridot  messengers of the situation in the Jade Mines, Verkal Ozovar\nalso  organised  an  expeditionary force to aid in the relief of Grônstunad in 2425 BA.

The Peridot Dwarves\nwere   known   for  their  peacemaking  among  the  holds  of  the  Serpentspine  and  their\npromotion  of  cooperation with each other rather than holding grudges. Nicknamed as the\n“Welcoming Gate”, Grôzumdihr was known for its cooperation with the humans of ancient\nRakhadesh, so much so that the humans also accepted the Peridot Dwarves into their lands\nas they fled their hold due to the Goblintide which plagued the Tree of Stone.\n\n== Culture and Customs ==\nGrôzumdihr  was known for the thousands of peridot stones that stud the main doors of the\nhold.  They  twinkle  the colour of new spring growth when the sun rises over the Marutha,\nmarking  out  the  hold’s  entrance  from  the grey granite of the mountains. Above the gate\nwere  carved  the  words  'All  dwarf-friends  are  welcome'  in  both  dwarven  and ancient\nRakhadeshi,  for  Grôzumdihr  has  long  been  friends to humans. The first civilizations of\nmen  in Rahen owe much of their knowledge of writing, agriculture, and law to the dwarves\nof  Grôzumdihr,  particularly  Sivondi  the  Good,  who aided the humans in building their\nfirst  true  cities  on the surface. The halls within the Welcoming Gate resounded for many\nlong  ages  with  the  sounds  of  cooperation  between  dwarves  and men, and still the gate\nbeckons, welcoming all with peaceful intention.\n\nWhile  dwarfkind  is  famed  for  holding  grudges  and demanding reparations, the Peridot\nDwarves  were notable peacemakers among their kin. Even in the time of the Jade Empire,\nwhen  the  arrogant  lords  of  Grônstunad  were  locked in combat with the Segbandal, the\nPeridot  attempted  to  promote  cooperation  within  and  between  dwarven  states such as\ncreating  the  Drizdahvad after the fall of the Jade Empire, forging pacts with even the gruff\nGranites  and  imperious  Jade. These treaties, and the many accords of friendship with the\nRaheni  on  the  surface,  were compiled into the Tome of Alliances, a great book of graces\nand  promises  to  be fulfilled and called upon in times of need. The Peridot Dwarves were\nnotorious  for  keeping  their  oaths  and expecting others to hold their ends of the bargain,\neven  when  the  terms of such treaties were ancient and forgotten by the other party. While\nthis  did,  at  times,  cause  diplomatic  incidents,  it  earned  them  a  reputation  for  their\nunwavering devotion to their word."

He  stated that the western holds must be reclaimed by any means\nnecessary,   and  called  for  the  creation  of  a  reclamation  army.

Departing  from\nGrôzumdihr,  the  Reclamation  army  travelled  through  the  Hreenwegpas, and was never\nheard from again. It is clear that they had failed, but their exact fate is uncertain.\n\n==== The Third Call for Reclamation ====\nIn  5002  BA, Moilin III declared the third Call for Reclamation, and stated that the holds\nof  the  Segbandal  would kneel before his army as he moved westward or be destroyed. He\nbegan  to  besiege  Gor  Ozumbrog  in 5000 BA, but its defences much improved since the\nfirst  siege  by  Morri  Splitbeard.  Gor  Ozumbrog  was able to withstand the assaults with\nrelative ease causing a protracted siege to begin.\n\nAn  Amber Dwarf general by the name of Thrindul Frozenflame and his retinue defected to\nthe  Segbandal,  claiming  that  they  should  not be fighting their own kin and in 4874 BA,\nthey  had  attacked  the  besieging  reclamation army in the back, killing High King Moilin\nIII.

The Amethyst Dwarves were mostly avoided, and repelled in what few open\nbattles  took  place.  Grôzumdihr, meanwhile, simply kept its gates closed, and fired at any\nogre  that  came into reach of its trebuchets. The ogres maintained control over the region,\nsubjugating  the  few  humans  that  lived  there,  and  established  a  number  of  magically\nprotected strongholds."

Using  rune  magic, the expeditionaries managed to break the glamours\nobscuring many of the strongholds, and immediately began besieging several of them.\n\nAfter  many  decades  of  slowly  losing  strongholds  to  the  dwarves, the ogre magi finally\nsucceeded  in  improving their glamouring spells, protecting the surviving strongholds from\nthe  dwarven  expeditions. At this point in 3353 BA, however, their control over the region\nhad  been  mostly lost, and the ogres only kept contact with their direct tributaries in order\nto  avoid  detection.  There  were  still  occasional  skirmishes  with the dwarves, and those\nstrongholds that are still found by chance were quickly besieged and destroyed.\n\n==== Human Migration ====\nWith  the power of the ogres severely limited, and the dwarves uninterested in taking direct\ncontrol  over  the region, by 3180 BA, human tribes began to migrate into Northern Rahen\nin  large  numbers,  establishing  independent  towns  and  villages all over the region. The\nogres   still   occasionally   attempted   to  subjugate  them  or  bully  them  into  becoming\ntributaries,  but this constantly attracted the attention of dwarven expeditionary forces, who\npromptly  found  and destroyed the ogre stronghold attempting this. This began a period of\nfriendly  contact  and relations between the dwarves and humans, as the dwarves recognised\nthat  the  humans  establishing  themselves  could  permanently  break  the  strength  of the\nremaining ogres.\n\nFollowing   several   centuries   of  casual  cooperation  between  humans  and  dwarves  in\ncombating the ogres, many of the human tribes started seeking the explicit protection of the\nJade  Empire.  Former  ogre  tributaries  and independent later arrivals alike petitioned the\ndwarves  to  establish themselves as their nominal overlord, in return for protection against\nthe  ogres  and  the  ability  to trade with the holds. Jade High King Muiri I accepted all of\nthese  petitions,  and  within  a  few  decades  virtually  all of the human tribes in Northern\nRahen  were  under  the  direct  influence  of  the  Jade  Empire  by 2700 BA.

In a bloody battle, the Granite Dwarves were defeated, and Snorri V was\nkilled in 2443 BA.\n\n==== The Fall of Grônstunad ====\nHaving   recovered   from   the   battle   of  Hul-az-Krakazol,  a  second  Amethyst-Peridot\nexpedition  was  organised  in  2438  BA and sent overland to attack the hobgoblins. As the\nhobgoblins  were  prepared  this  time,  they  were  less  successful,  and  while  they  made\nprogress,   it  was  slow.  With  Grônstunad  besieged  by  the  Hobgoblins,  the  defenders\nlaunched  an attack to their south which was successful, finally meeting up with the army of\nthe  Amethyst-Peridot  expedition  and  the  Nephrite  Expedition  led  by queen Ogdis I of\nHul-az-Krakazol."

The  defenders  and  the\nexpeditionary  forces  quickly  entered the hold to try and repel them, resulting in a chaotic\nbattle  that  stretched  over  every  level  and  section  of  the  hold. The battle took several\nmonths,  as  the  dwarves  desperately  attempted  to  hold  on  to  their capital. High King\nMoilin  IV  of  the  Jade  Empire and most of his direct family were killed in this battle, as\nwas  queen Ogdis I of Hul-az-Krakazol. In the end, Grônstunad was lost, and the Dwarven\nsurvivors escaped to either Vûrdriz-Ândriz or the surface. The survivors that escaped to the\nsurface mostly settled in the holds where the expeditions came from.\n\n==== The Last Expedition ====\nThe  Dwarves  knew that a lot of survivors were still stuck in Vûrdriz-Ândriz and that, with\nGrônstunad  fallen,  it  was  only  a  matter  of  time  before  its defences failed. Under the\ncommand  of  king  Nori  II  of Grôzumdihr, a coalition was again formed between Verkal\nOzovar,  Hul-az-Krakazol,  and  Grôzumdihr  in  2396  BA. He also reached out to Ovdal\nKanzad  and  Ovdal-az-Ân, arguing that the Jade Empire is gone with the death of the High\nKing  and  the  fall  of  Grônstunad, and that this was only about saving Dwarvenkind from\nfurther  doom.  Ovdal Kanzad agreed, and sent a small expeditionary force with cannons to\naid  in  Grônstunad’s  reclamation.  Ovdal-az-Ân, however, had sealed their gates shut, and\nthe envoys were only met with crossbow bolts.\n\nThe  army  of  the  four  holds  quickly  dispatched  the much weakened hobgoblins on the\nsurface,  and  soon  laid  siege  to  Grônstunad  in 2394 BA. With aid of the cannons from\nOvdal  Kanzad,  the siege was quite successful despite not cutting off the access routes from\ninside  the  mountains,  and  the  hobgoblins regularly having to repel attacks and throw up\ntemporary defences as their walls were broken by cannonfire.\n\nWith  the  Dwarven  attackers mostly situated in the tunnel access towards Grônstunad, the\nhobgoblins  sent  reinforcements  to  their  kin  on the surface, managing to put together an\narmy  to  lock the dwarven army inside the tunnel. By 2390 BA, with their supplies cut off,\nthe  dwarves  abandoned  the  siege.  They  broke  through  the  army  on  the  surface, and\nreturned  home  with  their  goal unfulfilled. With no support or supplies from the outside,\nVûrdriz-Ândriz  fell  to  the  goblin  and hobgoblin attackers. By all records, there were no\nsurvivors in 2368 BA."

They reclaimed the Dwarovrod with relative ease, and\nwere  elated  to  find Tuwad-Dhûmankon surviving and thriving. The expected assault from\nthe  hobgoblins  had  never  come,  and  the  great  food  gardens had easily sustained their\npopulation.\n\n=== The Drizdahvad ===\n\n==== The Proclamation ====\nGrôzumdihr,   Hul-az-Krakazol   and   Tuwad-Dhûmankon   agreed   to  the  three  shields\nproclamation, or Drizdahvad in 2135 BA, promising that they will all cooperate in coming\nto  the  others’  defence  in  case  of  an  attack and keeping the supply routes between their\nholds  over the Dwarovrod safe from raiders. In order to safeguard the supply line between\nTuwad-Dhûmankon  and  Hul-az-Krakazol,  both  ends of the tunad were fortified in 2100\nBA,  to  ensure  that  no goblins or hobgoblins could move between the Jade Mines and the\nTree  of  stone.  The  Drizdahvad  ensured  a  long  lasting  survival  of the holds for over a\nmillennia,  allowing them to make use of the now fairly reliable surface trade networks that\nthe  humans  of Rahen and Bulwar had established, with Grôzumdihr and Hul-az-Krakazol\nre-establishing contact with the holds of the west by 1102 BA.\n\n==== The Siege of Tuwad-Dhûmankon ====\nIn  the 920s BA, the warring hobgoblin clans united behind the great Mage-Queen Shakuin\nthe  Iron Spider and began to war with the dwarves of Tuwad-Dhûmankon. The hobgoblins\nfought  craftily  and  slowly  encircled the hold, cutting off communications with the rest of\nthe  Drizdahvad and getting into position to launch targeted attacks that crippled the ability\nof the dwarves to venture out."

Expecting their foes to\nflee before them like goblins often did, the dwarven relief army was slowed by the stubborn\ndefence  of  the hobgoblins, and though the Emerald Dwarves thrice attempted to break out\nand  connect  with their allies, they were repulsed each time. Only a few escaped the fall of\nthe  hold  by 908 BA, which the amethyst and peridot could see go dark in the distance but\ndo nothing to save.\n\n==== The Siege of Grôzumdihr ====\nAfter many centuries of disunity, the goblins of the Tree of Stone were once again united in\n550   BA,   this   time   under   clanboss   Praaq   Bloodscrawl.  The  Dwarovrod  between\nHul-az-Krakazol  and Grôzumdihr was again cut off, forcing the holds to move their supply\nroutes  to  the  surface.  Clan  Bloodscrawl laid siege to Grôzumdihr in 531 BA. The hold\nwas  well  defended  and  fortified,  and had access to an open supply line due to their good\nrelations with the Ghankheden humans beyond their surface gate. Still, the siege took a toll\non  the  defenders, as the goblins kept making use of tunnelling to attempt to gain access to\nthe unguarded sections of the hold.\n\n==== The Last Battle of the Drizdahvad ====\nWith  Grôzumdihr  invoking  the  Drizdahvad  and  asking for help from Hul-az-Krakazol,\nking Otik II organised a large relief force in 501 BA. However, he viewed the Grôzumdihr\nrequest  to  send  troops  via the surface as an insult to his competence, and led his dwarves\nover  the  Dwarovrod  instead.  This  ended in disaster, as this route had not been kept safe\nsince  the start of the second goblintide, and when the dwarves finally got near Grôzumdihr\nthey  had  already  suffered  many losses and lost much of their supplies. Otik II personally\nled  an  attack  on  the besieging goblins, but the exhausted dwarves were quickly cornered.\nSeeing the battle, the Grôzumdihr garrison sortied from the main gate in an attempt to save\nthe  Amethyst  dwarves,  but  they  were too late. Only five dwarves of the relief force were\nrescued and brought inside the hold. The rest, including king Otik II, were killed."

 page_events.2200.d: "\n\n==== The Fall of Grôzumdihr ====\nWith the goblin siege still ongoing, and the situation becoming ever more dire, king Thrim\nV  of Grôzumdihr made the decision to abandon the hold in 438 BA. He used a portion of\nthe  gold  in  the  vault to purchase bits of land from the Ghankheden outside the gate, and\nbegan  an orderly evacuation. Leaving the hold, the dwarves reached out to the Rahenrajas,\nwho  still  ruled the region at the time, and asked for safe settlement within the lands of the\nGhankheden.  The  Rajas  agreed to this after several gifts were exchanged, and the Peridot\nbecame mostly autonomous vassals of the Rahenraj for the next two hundred years. During\nthis  time,  many  of  the peridot left the hills of the Serpentspine and settled across Rahen,\noften in urban communities where they could ply their trades and have ample customers.\n\nUnder  the  rule  of  Thrim  VI  in the 300s BA, the dwarves prospered on the surface, but\ncontinued  to  disseminate from the western hills, which were rich in metals but poor in all\nother  things.  The  King  of  the  Peridot  took to travelling around Rahen to visit with the\nmany pockets of his people who had settled in the cities of the realm. This great procession\nbetween  the Peridot communities meant the king was almost always on the road, and so he\ndid  not  have  a  proper  seat  of  power  or  even a throne. Instead, the seat of the Peridot\npeople came to be known as “The Palanquin Throne”, and the procession “The Wandering\nCourt”.\n\nWhen the Rahenraj collapsed, the Peridot continued their self rule on the surface, but their\nthen-monarch  Thuri  XI  saw that the chaos of the emerging warlords period would be just\nas   unkind  to  the  dwarves  as  their  human  neighbours.  At  his  direction,  the  warrior\ncommunities of the Peridot approached the former governor of Rayavashapal and offered to\ndefend  the  city  and  its  surrounding  lands  in  exchange for autonomy and safety for any\ndwarves  who came to the region. This relationship evolved into a power sharing agreement\nbetween  the  Peridot  Kings  and the Lords of Rayavashapal over the next two hundred and\nfifty  years.  In  order  to  avoid  any  conflicting  claims  to power, the Peridot did not call\nthemselves  Kings  of  Rayavashapal  or  Pasiragha,  but  styled  themselves  as  “Exilarch of\nGrôzumdihr,  King  of  the  Peridot  People, Lord Protectors of Rakhadesh”. This de-facto\ndwarven kingdom would persist until year 36, when Harimar’s armies smashed the dwarven\nhost  on  the  field, and led them to sue for peace. Harimar’s peace terms were lenient, and\nmuch  of  the  autonomy  of  the  Peridot  people was preserved, but the Exilarchs could no\nlonger  use  the  title  king.  Thus,  ultimately,  the Exilarch was left landless and without a\nclaim  of  kingship, becoming the cultural head of a people without a state, who would still\ntravel  between  his  people’s  communities  and  organise cooperation between increasingly\nindependent dwarven exclaves."

Many of the High\nKings of Aul-Dwarov were originally from the clans of the Haraz Orldhûm which held it in\nhigh  regards, even considering the Highlords of the hold as first amongst equals among the\nkings of the Dwarovar. The arts of creating platinum jewelry was highly popularized across\nthe  Dwarovar  by  the  Platinum Dwarf artisans, which was famously resistant to damaging\nand relics made of platinum were able to be unearthed in good condition.\n\n==Culture and Customs==\nSlavery  was  a  deeply  engrained  institution  in  Haraz  Orldhûm which not only involved\nGoblins,  who  were  natural  enemies  to  the  Dwarves but also their own brethren. Other\nDwarves  were  enslaved  either  by punishment for being criminals, or by using their debts\nagainst  them to claim their freedom. The slaves were mainly used for menial tasks such as\nmining  and  building with worse conditions than normal workers had, which in turn led to\ngreater profits with an unpaid workforce. Many holds viewed this slavery as immoral while\nothers accepted it as Haraz Orldhûm was already held in such high regards by Aul-Dwarov.\nArtisanry  of jewelry was respected greatly as it brought beauty and gracefulness to the hold\nas well as high profits with exports all around the Dwarovar.\n\nThe  Nobility  of  Haraz  Orldhûm  was very proud of their ancestors and noble line, being\nable  to  trace their line back thousands of years back. They were very skeptical of any new\nclans  emerging  in  the  Dwarovar,  usually  questioning  their  achievements while naming\ndozens  of  their own. They wouldn’t recognize noble blood unless it went back generations,\nsometimes even respecting the old clans of holds they were averse of.\n\nAsymmetric  warfare  was  important  to  the  hold  which  emphasized  fortifying the many\ncaverns around the hold with towers carved into the walls of the caverns, named the Turrets\nof  Orldhûm,  as  well as many outposts which made their surroundings a deathtrap for any\nenemies  who dared challenge the Platinum Dwarves. Rangers were a famous contingent of\nthe  Orldhûmic army who revolutionized the hold's and eventually dwarven style of warfare\nwith foraging parties, forward scouts and ambushers."

Very  few suits were ever made as the secrets of their craft was highly coveted so\nthat their rivals did not acquire their technology.\n\n==History==\n\n=== The Counterattack of the Western Holds ===\nIn 5895 BA, the combined forces of Haraz Orldhûm, Ovdal Asra and Khugdihr launched a\ncounter  attack  against  the  orcs occupying Verkal Vazkron and along with the Dwarves of\nAmldihr,  Orlazam-az-dihr  and the Grim legion of Krakdhûmvror, slew every last orc that\nsieged  the  hold.

All the hold had left was 1000\nwarriors, 100 warsuits, 2000 slaves and one weak queen. At the beginning, the orcs tried to\nbesiege  the  hold via the caverns surrounding it which proved to be a disaster. The Turrets\nof Orldhûm were a death trap to the orcs with none being able to traverse the caves without\ngetting bombarded from multiple directions.\n\nQueen  Tharit II ''“The Weak”'' was reigning during the time of the siege and proved to be\none  of  the  weakest rulers Haraz Orldhûm had ever seen as she delegated her issues in the\nhold  to her advisors to fix and being all around incompetent. After 100 years of prolonged\nfighting  with  a  depleted  number of dwarf defenders, the queen decided to offer the dwarf\nslaves  freedom  in  exchange for the defense of the hold which was cautioned as a bad idea\nby her people, but ended up happening as she saw it to be just."

Thinkers, architects,\ninventors,  and  others  came  together  to celebrate the legacy of the designer of holds, and\nhere  they  discussed  new  ideas  and drank fine beer while also putting on a fancy show of\nnew  ideas.  The  amount  of  alcohol  consumed  at  this party had been the cause of many\ncontroversies  regarding  the  actions  of  the  intelligentsia  while  drunk,  but  many rather\nrevolutionary ideas came out of the drunk thinkers' mouths, and were used to great effect.\n\nThe  Pyrite  Dwarves were said to be "cursed" with a strange addiction to work, and would\nquite  literally  kill  themselves  should they be stuck in a prolonged period of time without\nany  work. Many historians and scientists have attempted to find the source of this "curse",\nyet  none  have  succeeded,  and even now no theory to explain it have been accepted.

 page_events.672.d: "\nHul-az-Krakazol  was  a  dwarf  hold  in  the  Tree  of  Stone  known  as  the  ''Hall  of the\nBrewmasters'',  the  home of master brewers, joyous carousers and furious berserkers. The\nAmethyst  Dwarves  were  known  for their cultivation of Serpentbloom and other plants to\nbrew  alcohol  with, exporting much far and wide in Aul-Dwarov. Their brews served many\nother  purposes  too,  from  supplying  front-line  soldiers  to  raise  morale  to  inducing a\nberserker  rage  from a special brew. Although their hold had fallen in year 88, most of the\nAmethyst  Dwarves  had  escaped  to the surface, making lives for themselves in Rahen and\npreserving their craft and culture.\n\n==Culture and Customs==\nThe  Amethyst  Dwarves were famous for their brewing. It is said that they were the people\nwho  originally  discovered  the  fermenting  process, and created the first beers. Backed by\nhundreds   of  years  of  improvements,  Amethyst  brews  are  renowned  for  their  unique\nflavours,  quality,  and potency. The quality and quantity of ale produced in the hold was of\nsuch   a   high   standard,   that  the  Amethyst  Gem  was  placed  in  the  Dwarovkron  of\nAul-Dwarov  to  honour  Hul-az-Krakazol’s  craft,  expanding  their influence all across the\nEmpire.\n\nThe  Valkumol,  or  'Welcome  Ale',  is  an  Amethyst tradition of swapping an ale or beer\nwhen   having   a   friendly  meeting,  helping  everyone  keep  a  calm  demeanour  during\nnegotiations.  The  finer  the  spirit,  the greater the respect shown to the recipient, it being\ncommon  to  give  the  finest  in  all  of  Aul-Dwarov  to  the  High  King  and  many other\ninfluential  visitors  when  visiting  Hul-az-Krakazol. Failing to bring spirits to swap can be\nperceived  as  a  slight,  and  ignoring  such  a tradition would often be used to begin a duel\nbetween  the  two  parties  -  even  if  the  one  who  forgot  happened  to be the High King\nhimself.\n\nOstensibly  founded  after  a  boisterous party got out of hand, Hul-az-Krakazol was one of\nthe  first  holds to set up a permanent hospital. Called the Heilzahul, the hospital became a\nplace  for  many  dwarves  to  learn  how to heal. The practice carried into wars, with field\nhospitals and healers up near the front lines to help heal the inevitable casualties of war."

The  secret  to this unnatural bravery was a special brew that soldiers\ndrank  before  heading  into battle, which rendered them numb to pain and doubt and fear.\nThe secret of this battle-brew would famously spread east when, according to the legends, a\nlost  amethyst  berserker  was  found by a dozen Xia martial artists. Fueled by the brew and\nthinking  himself  captured,  he  proceeded  to  fight  and  defeat  all of the warriors before\ncoming  to  his  senses.  Impressed  by  this  feat,  these martial artists traded the Amethyst\ndwarf refuge and safe passage for the secret of his spirits, and with this knowledge would go\non   to   found   a   new  branch  of  martial  arts  focused  on  utilising  this  new  brew  in\nLiuhexingzhe, where the Way of the Drunken Fist is practiced to this day.\n\n==History==\n\n\n=== Issues on the Surface ===\n\n==== First Ogre Incursion ====\nAs  ogres  began  to  migrate  into  the  foothills near Hul-az-Krakazol, some of the human\nbands  that  lived  there requested aid from the Amethyst Dwarves. Delighted to fight these\nformidable  opponents,  the  dwarves  agreed,  and  fought and defeated the ogres in several\nopen   battles.   Clearly   outmatched,  the  ogres  abandoned  their  incursions,  expanding\nelsewhere in Rahen.\n\n==== The Second Ogre Incursion ====\nWith  the ogres having become more established in central Rahen in around 3900 BA, they\nhad  begun  a  second incursion into northern Rahen, much bigger and better prepared than\nthe  first  one.  The  Amethyst dwarves were mostly avoided, and repelled in what few open\nbattles  took  place.  Grôzumdihr, meanwhile, simply kept its gates closed, and fired at any\nogre  that  came into reach of its trebuchets. The ogres maintained control over the region,\nsubjugating  the  few  humans  that  lived  there,  and  established  a  number  of  magically\nprotected strongholds."

Using  rune  magic, the expeditionaries managed to break the glamours\nobscuring many of the strongholds, and immediately began besieging several of them.\n\nAfter  many  decades  of  slowly  losing  strongholds  to  the  dwarves, the ogre magi finally\nsucceeded  in  improving their glamouring spells, protecting the surviving strongholds from\nthe  dwarven  expeditions. At this point in 3353 BA, however, their control over the region\nhad  been  mostly lost, and the ogres only kept contact with their direct tributaries in order\nto  avoid  detection.  There  were  still  occasional  skirmishes  with the dwarves, and those\nstrongholds that are still found by chance were quickly besieged and destroyed.\n\n=== Fall of the Jade Empire ===\n\n==== The Goblintide ====\nUnder the command of Grimka the Despoiler, a powerful goblin wizard, the goblins of the\nTree  of  Stone  united  in 2497 BA, and began large-scale assaults on all transport between\nthe  holds.  While  none  of  the  holds were attacked head-on, they were all de facto under\nsiege,  as  they  could  barely  reach  any of the other holds. As it became apparent that the\nTree  of  Stone  holds  were  unable  to regain control over the Dwarovrod by themselves, a\nmassive  army  led  by  general  Dourban  Brightbrow  was  rallied in Grônstunad to regain\ncontrol over the Tree of Stone in 2474 BA.\n\nAs  the jade army entered the Tree of Stone, Grimka sent emissaries to the hobgoblin clans\nin  the Jade Mines and on the surface, proposing a united front against the dwarves in 2472\nBA. In return, they promised the Hobgoblins would receive Grônstunad, the grandest hold\nof the east, as their prize."

King  Grongnir  I  of  Hul-az-Krakazol  offered  troops and\nsupplies  to  the  army  as  they  prepared  to  move further into the Tree of Stone. In turn,\nGrimka  ordered  a  full  siege  of  Ovdal-az-Ân  in  order  to delay the dwarves as much as\npossible, and sent word to the hobgoblin and goblin tribes of the jade mines.\n\n==== Chaos in the Jade Mines ====\nAs  the  jade  army  reached  Ovdal-az-Ân  and started to dismantle the fortifications of the\nbesieging  goblins,  the  hobgoblin  armies  from Rahen launched an assault on Grônstunad\nfrom  the  south  in  2470  BA.  The alarm was raised, and messages were sent to the other\nholds in the Jade mines and to the expeditionary force in the Tree of Stone.\n\nWith the attack from the south commencing, the goblins and hobgoblins of the Jade Mines\nalso  initiated  their  attacks,  and  shut off the access routes from the east and west towards\nGrônstunad  in  2469  BA. The Jade Mines were in virtually the same situation as the Tree\nof Stone now, with all access between holds nearly impossible.\n\n==== Relief of Ovdal-az-Ân ====\nThe  jade army broke the siege of Ovdal-az-Ân, routing the goblin forces in 2468 BA, with\nthe  jade  army requesting supplies and access past the hold in order to relieve Grôzumdihr\nas  well,  but  king  Snorri  V  refused.  He  was  insulted by the Jade armies, as he had not\nrequested  them,  and  their  presence  implied  they  were  unable  to  deal  with  a simple\ninfestation  of  goblins around their hold. After nearly two months of attempting diplomacy\nwith  Snorri, the jade army returned to Hul-az-Krakazol.

Wounded in\nhis  pride,  Dourban  ordered  his  troops  to instead move through the Dwarovrod in 2466\nBA.  As  they  attempted  to  move  through  the  tunnel towards the Jade Mines, they were\nambushed  by a large force of goblins and hobgoblins, in what eventually turned into a long\nsiege as the jade army dug itself into a defensive position in the tunnel.\n\nThe  jade  army made one final attempt to push through the tunnel towards the Jade Mines\nin  2463  BA,  but  were  slain  to  the last. Hearing of this, Grimka believed this to be the\nmoment  to  strike,  and ordered all the clans to go on the offensive again, launching direct\nattacks on the holds of the Tree of Stone yet again.\n\n==== The Goblintide Shattered ====\nWhile  leading  a  direct  assault  on  Grôzumdihr,  Grimka the Despoiler was killed as he\nattempted  to  break  a  powerful  runic  warding spell defending an outer gate in 2460 BA.\nThe  energy  released  as  the  spell  was broken disintegrated Grimka as well as any goblin\nwithin  his  vicinity.  Almost  immediately, the clans taking part in the siege started to fight\namongst  themselves  over  leadership  of  the  goblintide.  As  news  spread, the goblintide\ndisintegrated  as the many clans fell back into their old rivalries. The hobgoblins, however,\nremained united in their attacks against the Jade Empire.\n\n==== Granite Independence and Betrayal ====\nWith  the  Tunad  towards  the Jade Mines thoroughly under the control of the hobgoblins,\nthe  holds  of  the  Tree of Stone focused mostly on reclaiming control over the Dwarovrod\napart  from the area around Ovdal Kanzad.

They intended to attack the surface settlements\nof  the Hobgoblins, in order to cut off supplies from the besieging forces. As they were sent\nout,  however,  Snorri accused them of plotting to put them back under the heel of the Jade\nEmpire.  As  the  Amethyst-Peridot  expedition was fighting the hobgoblins in northeastern\nRahen,  Snorri  arrived  at  the  gates  of Hul-az-Krakazol with an army, and began a siege.\nEnraged by the betrayal, the Amethyst-Peridot expedition returned to Hul-az-Krakazol, and\nattacked  the  besieging  forces.  In  a bloody battle in 2443 BA, the Granite Dwarves were\ndefeated,  and Snorri V was killed. His body, on the orders of the furious queen Ogdis I of\nHul-az-Krakazol,  was  thrown  into  a pit, and an extension of the Hul-az-Krakazol sewers\nwould  eventually  be  built  to  direct  the waste of the Amethyst Dwarves into what would\nbecome known as Snorri’s Dung Pit.\n\n==== The Fall of Grônstunad ====\nHaving   recovered   from   the   battle   of  Hul-az-Krakazol,  a  second  Amethyst-Peridot\nexpedition  was  organised  in  2438  BA and sent overland to attack the hobgoblins. As the\nhobgoblins  were  prepared  this  time,  they  were  less  successful,  and  while  they  made\nprogress,   it  was  slow.  With  Grônstunad  besieged  by  the  Hobgoblins,  the  defenders\nlaunched  an attack to their south which was successful, finally meeting up with the army of\nthe  Amethyst-Peridot  expedition  and  the  Nephrite  Expedition  led  by queen Ogdis I of\nHul-az-Krakazol.\n\nAt   the   same  time,  however,  the  western  and  eastern  gates  were  breached,  and  the\nhobgoblins  and  goblins  entered  Grônstunad  from  both  sides.  The  defenders  and  the\nexpeditionary  forces  quickly  entered the hold to try and repel them, resulting in a chaotic\nbattle  that  stretched  over  every  level  and  section  of  the  hold. The battle took several\nmonths,  as  the dwarves desperately attempted to hold on to their capital. Emperor Moilin\nIV of the Jade Empire and most of his direct family were killed in this battle, as was queen\nOgdis  I  of  Hul-az-Krakazol. In the end, Grônstunad was lost, and the Dwarven survivors\nescaped  to  either  Vûrdriz-Ândriz or the surface.

Under the\ncommand  of  king  Nori  II  of Grôzumdihr, a coalition was again formed between Verkal\nOzovar,  Hul-az-Krakazol,  and  Grôzumdihr  in  2396  BA. He also reached out to Ovdal\nKanzad  and  Ovdal-az-Ân,  arguing  that  the  Jade  Empire  is  gone  with the death of the\nEmperor  and  the  fall  of  Grônstunad,  and  that this was only about saving Dwarvenkind\nfrom  further  doom.  Ovdal  Kanzad  agreed,  and  sent  a  small  expeditionary force with\ncannons  to  aid in Grônstunad’s reclamation. Ovdal-az-Ân, however, had sealed their gates\nshut, and the envoys were only met with crossbow bolts.\n\nThe  army  of  the  four  holds  quickly  dispatched  the much weakened hobgoblins on the\nsurface,  and  soon  laid  siege  to  Grônstunad  in 2394 BA. With aid of the cannons from\nOvdal  Kanzad,  the siege was quite successful despite not cutting off the access routes from\ninside  the  mountains,  and  the  hobgoblins regularly having to repel attacks and throw up\ntemporary defences as their walls were broken by cannonfire.\n\nWith  the  Dwarven  attackers mostly situated in the tunnel access towards Grônstunad, the\nhobgoblins  sent  reinforcements  to  their  kin  on the surface, managing to put together an\narmy  to  lock the dwarven army inside the tunnel. By 2390 BA, with their supplies cut off,\nthe  dwarves  abandoned  the  siege.  They  broke  through  the  army  on  the  surface, and\nreturned  home  with  their  goal unfulfilled. With no support or supplies from the outside,\nVûrdriz-Ândriz  fell  to  the  goblin  and hobgoblin attackers. By all records, there were no\nsurvivors in 2368 BA.\n\n==== Reconnection with Tuwad-Dhûmankon ====\nWith  the  hobgoblins  and goblins disunited with infighting in the Jade Mines, the dwarves\nof  Grôzumdihr  and  Hul-az-Krakazol organised an expedition to try and push through the\ntunnel  towards  the  Jade  Mines in 2143 BA, to find out whether Tuwad-Dhûmankon had\nsurvived the fall of the Jade Empire. They reclaimed the Dwarovrod with relative ease, and\nwere  elated  to  find Tuwad-Dhûmankon surviving and thriving. The expected assault from\nthe  hobgoblins  had  never  come,  and  the  great  food  gardens had easily sustained their\npopulation."

In order to safeguard the supply line between\nTuwad-Dhûmankon  and  Hul-az-Krakazol,  both  ends of the tunad were fortified in 2100\nBA,  to  ensure  that  no goblins or hobgoblins could move between the Jade Mines and the\nTree  of  stone.  The  Drizdahvad  ensured  a  long  lasting  survival  of the holds for over a\nmillennia,  allowing them to make use of the now fairly reliable surface trade networks that\nthe  humans  of Rahen and Bulwar had established, with Grôzumdihr and Hul-az-Krakazol\nre-establishing contact with the holds of the west by 1102 BA.\n\n==== The Siege of Tuwad-Dhûmankon ====\nIn  the 920s BA, the warring hobgoblin clans united behind the great Mage-Queen Shakuin\nthe  Iron Spider and began to war with the dwarves of Tuwad-Dhûmankon. The hobgoblins\nfought  craftily  and  slowly  encircled the hold, cutting off communications with the rest of\nthe  Drizdahvad and getting into position to launch targeted attacks that crippled the ability\nof the dwarves to venture out.\n\nBy  the  time that the Amethyst Dwarves realised something was wrong and rallied an army\nto  relieve  Tuwad-Dhûmankon,  the  hold  was  already  dangerously close to falling to the\nmagically-aided  tunnelling  efforts  and  tenacity of the hobgoblins. Expecting their foes to\nflee before them like goblins often did, the dwarven relief army was slowed by the stubborn\ndefence  of  the hobgoblins, and though the Emerald Dwarves thrice attempted to break out\nand  connect  with their allies, they were repulsed each time. Only a few escaped the fall of\nthe  hold  by 908 BA, which the amethyst and peridot could see go dark in the distance but\ndo nothing to save."

However, he viewed the Grôzumdihr\nrequest  to  send  troops  via the surface as an insult to his competence, and led his dwarves\nover  the  Dwarovrod  instead.  This  ended in disaster, as this route had not been kept safe\nsince  the start of the second goblintide, and when the dwarves finally got near Grôzumdihr\nthey  had  already  suffered  many losses and lost much of their supplies. Otik II personally\nled  an  attack  on  the besieging goblins, but the exhausted dwarves were quickly cornered.\nSeeing the battle, the Grôzumdihr garrison sortied from the main gate in an attempt to save\nthe  Amethyst  dwarves,  but  they  were too late. Only five dwarves of the relief force were\nrescued and brought inside the hold. The rest, including king Otik II, were killed.\n\n==== The Siege of Hul-az-Krakazol ====\nWith  the siege of Ovdal Kanzad making no progress for many generations of goblins, King\nKloq  Bloodscrawl  finally  abandoned  the  siege  and  put  his  sights  on Hul-az-Krakazol\ninstead in year 33. At first, there was intense fighting, as the Amethysts attempted to put an\nend  to the siege before it was properly established with several sorties, but these amounted\nto  very  little.

All except for the Oathstone Clan who remained firm\nin their beliefs.\n\n==== Exile of the Oathstones ====\nThe  Agate  Dwarves  had  enough  of  the  Oathstones  and  their  refusal  to  abandon the\nPantheon,  with  the  young  King  Storum  Carûm  in  particular,  being very irritated that\ndwarves  more  stubborn  than  himself  existed. He confronted the Oathstone patriarch for\none  final  attempt  to  convert the stubborn dwarves, yet Patriarch Karrom Oathstone only\nreplied with “In the darkest of moments, the gods’ light shines the brightest”.\n\nThus  in  643  BA,  a  decree  was made, outlining that any dwarf aged more than a century\nthat  worshipped  the  old  Pantheon  had  to  leave  the hold and worship their faith on the\nsurface.\n\n====Balgar’s Exile====\nWhen  the  Oathstone  Decree  was made, Balgar was a mere 58 years old. He was exempt\nfrom  it  for  now,  but  he  had  no  intentions  of  abandoning  his  faith. He would slowly\nincorporate   the  Pantheon  into  his  works,  notably  creating  works  involving  Anvelind\nHearthmaiden  and  Margurz  the  Brewmaster.  At  first the dwarves dismissed this to be a\nyoung  dwarf’s  foolishness,  but  once  Balgar  reached  the  age  of  63,  his  not  so subtle\ncreations  got  problematic.  Great  monuments  to  the Pantheon were made that outshone\nmost  of the hold’s creations leading him to soon be exiled to the surface in 638 BA despite\nnot reaching his century day.\n\nDespite  his exile, Balgar would always be remembered for his mastery of stone. Eventually\nbecoming  a  worshipped  ancestor  in  the  hold that exiled him, and two years later in 636\nBA, Balgar would meet Castan the Progenitor and enter into his service."

They launched a surprise attack out of their\nnorthern  caves,  allowing  them  to  deal  devastating  damage  to the giants before they are\nforced to retreat back to the hold. After that initial assault, the Agate Dwarves would resort\nto guerrilla tactics for the duration of the war.\n\nA  hero  had  however emerged in 397 BA, a dwarf named Murri joined an expedition into\nthe  lands  of  the  giants  several  years  after the start of the war. When his expedition was\ndefeated,  however,  Murri  was  one  of  very  few  survivors.  Rather than going home and\naccepting  defeat,  Murri  led  this  small  band  on  an  extended guerrilla campaign in the\nNorthern  Pass,  becoming  feared  among the armies of the giants. As one of his ambushes\nfailed,  he alone held a mountain pass against the giants to allow his companions to escape,\nand  tell  the  tales  of his deeds back in Khugdihr. Many years later, his corpse was found,\nsurrounded by the remains of a dozen giants which earned him the title “Giantbreaker”.\n\n===The Dragonwake===\n\n==== Nimrith the Red’s Attack ====\nCannor  was  rocked  by  chaos  like  never  before,  with the Dragonwake causing dragons\ntaking  flight and destroying much in their path. Unfortunately for the Dwarovar, it was no\ndifferent.  In  the  section  of  the Dwarovrod once collapsed by King Murnir the Vengeful,\nsomething had awoken in 470. This was the great dragon Nimrith the Red, who burst forth\nfrom  the rubble beneath, forming a great hole rent from the earth, and opening the path to\nKhugdihr once more to the greater Dwarovar."

Barely\nwas  there  time  to ring the alarm before the gate’s garrison was consumed in dragon flame\nand devoured in turn.\n\nMany  were  caught  in  Nimrith’s  flames  but  due  to  Nimrith's rage, his path was rather\nstraightforward- the gate leading to the surface, and Castanor. Those who did not flee from\nthe  dragon’s  path  were food for the dragon. Nimrith would then burn his way through the\nhold,  taking  flight  from  Khugdihr  to  terrorise the rest of Cannor. After his departure, a\nnumber  of refugees would flee the devastated hold, as the pathway to the Dwarovar now lay\nopen.  Those  few  who  remained  behind  attempted to repair the hold to the best of their\nability.\n\n====Arrival of the Darkscales====\nOne  by  one,  the  remaining dwarves of Khugdihr would claim to see dragons in the dark.\nBipedal  and  small,  their  forms  stalked  the scorched halls that had been abandoned and\npartially  melted  by  dragon  flame.  The remaining Agate Dwarves, unbeknownst to them,\nhad  encountered  kobolds,  drawn  to  the  site where Nimrith had awakened, and ready to\nprepare  the  hold  for his perceived return. The kobolds themselves had emerged from the\ntunnel  in  which  Nimrith had awakened. It is at this point, through the broken gate to the\nDwarovar  that a small horde of kobolds emerged. This is what finally drove out the last of\nthe  stubborn  dwarven  holdouts  from  Khugdihr  in  476, with even those insane few who\ntried  to  remain  behind  being slaughtered. The emergent kobolds then began to prepare a\nvast room filled with treasure to summon their “god.”\n\nTwo  years  after  their  arrival in 478, the kobolds believed their efforts had been rewarded\nwith  the  return  of  Nimrith.  In  truth,  Nimrith  had  simply  ceased  his rampage across\nCannor  and  was  planning  to  return to the caves of the Serpentspine to slumber. Despite\nthis,  for  whatever  enigmatic reason Nimrith decided to remain in Khugdihr. Shortly after\nhis return was the arrival of the Nimrithan."

Expelled from Damescrown for their\nviews,  they  trekked  in  the path of the Dragon, and arrived at Khugdihr. Where they met\nwith  the  kobolds,  and offered all their worldly possessions to the great dragon as a sign of\nsubmission  and  reverence.  In  doing  so,  they were welcomed within the halls of the Red\nDragon, and the Cult of the Nimrithan was born in earnest, kobold and human together.\n\n====Death of Nimrith the Red====\nThe  Nimrithan  had  by  1103  settled  into  much of Khugdihr, turning the entirety of the\nhold  into  a  mixture  of  monastery,  fortress,  and  treasure  vault  for  the  great  dragon.\nUnfortunately,  such  wealth  and opulence had attracted many over the years who sought it\nfor themselves. With much of Cannor having recovered after the War of the Sorcerer King,\nand  the  era of Chivalric Escann in full bloom, many saw Nimrith and his followers as the\nlast  major  threat  to  the  relative  peace that had been established in Escann following the\nWar of the Sorcerer King.\n\nSo,  a  bold  party  of  adventurers  dared  the  inconceivable.  They  ventured  forth to slay\nNimrith  the  Red,  and infiltrated the hold to do so. The following battle rocked the entire\nhold,  as  several  days  of fighting took place, devastating entire sections with dragon flame\nand  magic.  But in the end, after 625 years of residence in Khugdihr, Nimrith the Red was\nslain, and Khugdihr was liberated.\n\nIn the aftermath, many kobolds and human followers of Nimrith fled, most humans fled to\nthe surface, and many kobolds into the depths of the Serpentspine. Whilst in time the Cult\nof Nimrith would vanish on the surface, the kobolds within the caverns of the Serpentspine\nwould  remember,  after  a  fashion,  with  their beliefs and worship degenerating into what\nwould be expected from an unsupervised kobold.\n"

It was an extreme effort, but many Agate, and even some Stone Dwarves saw this\nas a once in a lifetime opportunity that could not be ignored.\n\nMoving  quickly,  entire clans moved into Khugdihr and began restoration efforts, first with\nthe main gates into and out of the hold, and then in repairing the damage to the hold itself,\nwhich  included much dragon related iconography. It would take decades to truly repair the\ndamages,  and the remaining kobolds in the hold to be flushed out and killed, but after five\ndecades  of  effort  it  was said that Khugdihr had been restored to its ancient and venerable\nself, just now with a few dragon-sized halls scattered throughout the hold.\n\n==== Return of the Darkscales====\nIn 1317, there was a rumbling in the deep. Down the Dwarovrod came a horde of kobolds\nled  by  a  charismatic  mage,  numbering  in  the tens of thousands with only one goal: the\nreclamation,  or  utter destruction of Khugdihr. The kobolds did not simply vanish into the\nSerpentspine  after  the  death  of  their  god  and master Nimrith, they instead turned their\nefforts   to   vengeance.   Though   it  took  two  centuries,  they  consolidated  and  armed\nthemselves to reclaim Khugdihr for themselves.\n\nThe  siege lasted nine years, with the kobolds even going as far to breach the main gate, but\neven after all that time, they could not best proper dwarven steel and massed crossbow fire.\nThe kobolds finally retreated with the death of their leader, and afterwards collapsed into a\nseries  of small tribes that scattered throughout the Serpentspine, unable to regain cohesion\nunder the strain of goblin and orcish opportunism.\n"

The\nexpedition  was successful in finding the hold but in turn found an early Greentide host led\nby  Dugorik  Dragonbreaker,  who  was  amassing  his  troops in order to launch a surprise\nattack  on  Khugdihr  through  tunnels they had excavated from the burial 6000 years in the\npast.  The  expedition  successfully  stopped  and slew Dugorik and recovered the gem with\nthe aid of an golem army the party had awakened.\n\n====The Fall of Khugdihr====\nWithin  the  Dwarovar, things were changing. Orcish warbands were seen in the vicinity of\nKhugdihr  as  early  as  1412,  and  with  the  news  provided by the First Asra Expedition,\nKhugdihr  was  aware  that  something  was coming. They could not, truly, be prepared for\nwhat occurred next.\n\nIn  1415,  Korgus  Dookanson  led a horde of orcs to the gates of Khugdihr, establishing a\nsiege  camp;  the  orcs  worked  tirelessly, creating siege engines and counter-fortifications.\nThe  dwarves  of  Khugdihr  were  not  dealing with some regular warlord, this Korgus was\nsomething   completely  different.  There  was  no  dissent,  no  jockeying  for  position  or\nprestige,  these  orcs  were  not  a warband, but an organised army. By 1420, the main gate\nhad been damaged, and the Black Orcs would be contesting the entry to the hold regularly.\nAt  this  point a Black Orc chieftain named Gurukk, one of the most devoted lieutenants of\nKorgus,  would  assume  command  of the besiegers. Korgus then returned to the depths of\nthe Serpentspine to rally more warbands for his army.\n\nUnder  the  command  of  Gurukk, the siege turned from restrained orcish savagery to cold\nand  brutal,  but  no  less  cunning  warfare.  Sappers,  siege  engines,  and  more  were  all\nemployed  to break the dwarves of Khugdihr. By 1423, Gurukk had seized control of more\nthan  1/3rd  of  the  entire hold, and had received a fresh batch of reinforcement by a force\n10,000  strong  trained  by  Korgus  Dookanson  himself,  freshly  trained and tested in the\nDwarovar.  By  1424,  Gurukk  had  broken  the  back  of the dwarven resistance, with the\nAgate  Dwarves  electing  to  abandon  Khugdihr.  A  few  were  taken  as captives. For his\nefforts,  Gurukk was granted the name “Siegebreaker” by Korgus himself, and instructed to\nensure  the  surface  would  receive  a  message.  Dead  dwarves  and  especially  visitors to\nKhugdihr  were  piled  into  carts, pulled by the few surviving dwarven captives which were\nthen  spread  throughout  Escann,  given  a warning in broken dwarven by Gurukk.“This is\nsimply  a  prelude  for  what  is to come. For you, your realms, and your gods.”The Fall of\nKhugdihr  caused  the  devastating  Greentide  to ravage Escann, with the orcs destroying it\nmuch  like  they  did  the  Dwarovar.  However, this led to a smaller number of orcs in the\nSerpentspine,  with  many  dwarven  expeditions setting out to reclaim their homeland soon\nafter the death of Dookanson."

 page_events.674.d: "\nKrakdhûmvror  is  a  dwarf  hold in the West Dwarovar known as ''Frozenforge Hall'', the\nhome of dwarven exiles, Ice-Steel and meritocracy. Known for being founded by exiles and\ncriminals  of  Aul-Dwarov  on  the  derelict ''Verkal Midjurdr Kralt'', which was a fortress\nthat  protected  the  dwarves from the Ice Giants, the hold was made up of various dwarves\nwho  had  to rise through skill to earn anything. The Quartz Dwarves were famous for their\nIce-Steel,  which  was  cryomantic  magic  infused  metal  that is very versatile and used for\nmany applications.\n\n== Culture and Customs ==\nThe  origin  of  Krakdhûmvror  comes from the old Verkal Midjurdr Kralt, the Fortress of\nthe  World's  End  which  was  originally  built to protect the Dwarovar against Ice Giants.\nWith  the  inhabitants  being a mixture of exiled and criminal dwarves, who built a new life\nand  turned  the  fortress  into  a  proper  hold,  forming  a  bond  of solidarity in the harsh\nconditions of both constant war and unforgiveable weather. The outcasts of the empire gave\nmore  to  the  survival  of  their  hold  than  any  dwarf elsewhere, and with that attitude, it\nbecame  known  as  the  "Chain Bond" amongst the Quartz Dwarves, a chain between each\nmember  of  the  hold  from  generation  to  generation forged in the frozen hardship of the\nnorth.\n\n"Zaru   ubr   Bloth"   or   Skill  over  Blood  has  long  been  an  unofficial  motto  of  the\nKrakdhûmvroric  administration  who valued meritocracy much more than the bloodline of\nsome  famous  clan. They favored individual talent and saw nepotism as sacrilegious which\nensured  an  innovative  and flexible administration for much of it's existence. The clans of\nKrakdhûmvror were different to the conventional clans of the rest of Aul-Dwarov, one clan\nmember  was  able to leave to another and were not tied to them by bloodline, although the\nleaving  of  one such clan was rare. The Quartz Dwarves employed a highly utilitarian style\nof  architecture  called  "Orv  Zana", or Cold Stone, it was a style that was designed purely\nfor defense and survival rather than beauty.\n\nKrakdhûmvror  was  famous  for  an unusual type of magic called Icecraft, which was more\nakin  to  magic  of Cannorian schools of magic rather than the runic magic dwarves usually\npracticed.  It  was  a  type  of  cryomancy  which  was  shrouded  in  secrecy  by the Quartz\nDwarves  which  was  also  used  in  the creation of the Frozen Forges which channeled the\nbiting cold of the northern winds into a magic energy, in turn creating Ice-Steel."

At first he was hesitant to send out\nhis forces but he believed that history would see the Quartz Dwarves as traitors or cowards.\nWith  that,  the  Grim Legion of Krakdhûmvror, clad in Ice-Steel marched not to fight old\nice giants of yore, but rather went south to save the empire that had shunned them.\n\nWith  these  reinforcements,  the Kronium and Ramsteel armies sallied out of Amldihr and\nmet  the  orcs  head  on in Verkal Vazkron, which instead trapped the orcs. Once the Grim\nLegion  arrived,  the  orcs  finally  tasted  fear, there was no escape for them as the western\nholds  attacked  from  the rear and the seemingly unkillable dwarves at the front and at that\nday's end, every orc that had stepped foot in Verkal Vazkron had laid dead.\n\nHowever,  Ducaniel  had  never  stopped  creating  orcs,  a  fact  that  the  dwarves quickly\ndiscovered. An even larger host of orcs had arrived through the Dwarovrod and managed to\ntake  the  Amlvaz tunnel, which instead trapped the western armies in Verkal Vazkron. The\nHall  of  Ancestors  fell  next  which  caused  a  direct  assault  on  Amldihr  proper, which\nprevented  reinforcements  to  Verkal  Vazkron,  causing  considerable losses to the western\ndwarves and the death of the Grim Legion.\n\n===The Frozen War===\nBy 5738 BA, the West Dwarovar was entirely crushed by the orcs. Craving a challenge, the\norcs  headed  north  towards  the  Giant's  Anvil  which  was  detached from the rest of the\nSerpentspine  Mountains,  however,  the  Quartz  Dwarves  stood  ever  defiant.  They  had\nabandoned  their outposts in the Northern Pass and retreated to the entrance of the Giant's\nAnvil  which  was  guarded  by  Kar  Durghoir,  the  Citadel of Dark Ice, where the Quartz\nDwarves had an overwhelming advantage ."

However, the Quartz Dwarves started to run out of\nsupplies  which  would originally be obtained from the rest of the Dwarovar, and with their\noutposts  in  the  Northern  Pass  abandoned,  they also lacked the means to hunt for food.\nWhat  food they had was what little their small scouting parties had managed to bring back\nand  the  ramshackle fungal farms they had set up in the the caves, nevertheless, the Quartz\nDwarves still managed to hold off the orcs for many more years.\n\n====Quartzfall====\nOne one fateful day in 2581 BA, the Ice-Smiths were preparing to drop an enormous block\nof  ice  on  the besieging orcs, but with a single catapult shot, everything changed.

The resources of the Dead End Caves were\nstill  plentiful  and above all else, completely safe. The lack of food however was beginning\nto  become  problematic  for  the  Quartz  Dwarves. At first the orcs attempted to siege the\nhold  like the ones before it but then realized it was a foolish mistake, the gates were forged\nfrom  Ice-Steel.  Any damage to the gate was almost instantly repaired by the flowing steel.\nThe  orcs sieged the hold for 80 years, trying anything they could to breach the gate, at one\npoint,  an  orc  named Aakax Rockskull even attempted to lick the gates, thinking he could\nlick  the  ice  off  of  it.

Once they came of age, to ensure\nthey  were  dedicated  to  never  betray  a  fellow Dwarf, they would swear a lifelong vow to\ntruth and honesty which was upheld very seriously.

During the days of Aul-Dwarov the\nRamsteel  Dwarves  were  tasked  with  protecting  the terraced farms of the Serpent's Vale\nagainst any would-be intruder. The Ramsteel Dwarves were renowned for their rangers that\nskulked  the  Serpent's  Vale  and  the  mountains  of  the  Serpentspine atop powerful Vale\nRams, an Ramsteel Dwarves breed of ram who were also used to help forge their namesake\nramsteel.\n\n== Culture and Customs==\nThe  Ramsteel Dwarves of Orlazam-az-dihr were famous for their rams and their Ramsteel,\nthe latter of which was made using the rams. They would use the rams' impressive horns to\nhelp  hammer  the  metal  while  it cooled, hardening it rapidly to create the final product.\nThe  iron  ore  that  was  used  for  steel  production  was mined from the Ramvault, which\nhoused a massive mining complex, several ramsteel forges, ram stables as well as a research\nlibrary.\n\nThe  first  ram  riders,  and  the  usage  of  dwarven  ram cavalry, originated with Ramsteel\nDwarven  frontier  woodsmen  and farmers who later formed a close bond with their native\nrams.  It  is  said  that  a bond between an Ramsteel Dwarves and their mount was stronger\nthan that of their spouse. An infamous form of capital punishment of the Ramlords was the\nHornwall  Punishment, which involved lining up the offending dwarves against the wall and\nhaving rams smash into them.\n\nThe  Ramsteel  Dwarves  were  known  to be very loyal to the High King of Amldihr as the\ntwo  holds  cooperated much with each other. They always stood by each other in Amlharaz\ndebates  and  other  disputes  as well as granting land in the Serpent's Vale for ram herding\nand offering privileges to the Ramsteel Dwarf nobility.\n\nThe  Orlazam  Lamb  was  a  staple in the halls of dwarven kings and nobles, known for its\njuicy  meat  and  flavor  from  the  surface.  By  the  time  Aul-Dwarov  fell,  the  Orlazam\nlamb-roasting techniques were lost to but a few masters."

After a\nlong  series  of  battles,  the  Ram  Riders lost a significant portion of their forces and were\nforced to retreat.\n\nThe  final  battle  of  Amldhir  took  place  in  5895  BA  and  Orlazam-az-dihr  sent  what\nremained   of  their  armies  to  reinforce  the  last  defenders  of  Amldhir,  while  a  small\ncontingent  of Ram Riders were sent to Krakdhûmvror to request additional forces. Having\nsecured  Krakdhûmvror's army, and with the remaining Ram Riders arriving, the battle was\nin  their  favor.  But  after  the  arrival of fresh orcish reinforcements, they faced a decisive\ndefeat.\n\n===The Fall of Orlazam-az-dihr===\nBy  5850 BA the orcs had reached the outskirts of Orlazam-az-dihr, the hold had lost all of\ntheir  armies  at  the  battle  of  Amldhir and had only guards and reserve forces left.

The hold was known for creating artisan glass with the addition of cobalt to\ncreate  a  blue  hue,  valuing  it  greatly  among  buyers.  The  Cobalt  Dwarves  were  also\nrecognized  for their university, ''Guntîrhug'', which allowed research and progress to keep\nadvancing  even  in  the apex of Aul-Dwarov and preventing complacency. Orlghelovar was\nknown to be lit with daylight due to the many contraptions of lenses and mirrors, making it\nuniquely bright for a hold.\n\n==Culture and Customs==\nThe  Cobalt  Dwarves  of  Orlghelovar  were known as the ''Glasslords'', due to the expert\ncraftmanship  of  glassmaking  with  their  dark  blue  Orlghelovar  Glass with which many\nancient  human  glass  relics  can  trace their origins to. With glassblowing requiring strong\nlungs,  the  Cobalt  Dwarves  were  famed  wind  instrumentalists due to the fact, famously\nmarching  to  war  with  trumpets  that inspired troops on the battlefield. Known to be very\ninquisitive,  the  Cobalt  Dwarves  would  constantly research the natural sciences and draft\nmany  papers  on  their  discoveries  in physics and other arcane subjects such as Halanna's\nBreath or Deepwoods plants harvested by the dwarves of Verkal Skomdihr.\n\nThe  Glasshammer  Fair  was a large yearly artisan glass convention which was first held in\n6735  BA  by  the master glassmaker and head of the Glasshammer Cartel. The convention\nwas  held in Amldihr which would showcase the new goods and styles from Orlghelovar. In\naddition  to  bringing  them  great  profits,  it  kept the Cobalt Dwarves up to date with the\ncomings-and-goings of the rest of the Dwarovar.\n\nThe  hold of Orlghelovar was facing the surface, allowing the Cobalt dwarves to experience\nsunlight,  but  they  were  unsatisfied  as  they  created intricate mirrors and lenses to direct\nsunlight inside of the hold. This created a very unique bright atmosphere which allowed for\nmore flora to be grown inside which brought life to the hold, something that many dwarves\nwould   desire   for   their   own   home.   ''Guntîrhug''  was  the  renowned  university  of\nOrlghelovar, which gathered many famous researchers from all across the Dwarovar as well\nas  many  students  willing  to  learn  from  them.  The university specialized in the natural\nsciences  as compared to engineering or astrology which allowed it to be the prime location\nfor all research in the Dwarovar."

 page_events.678.d: "\nOvdal-az-Ân  was  a  dwarf  hold  in  the  Tree  of Stone known as the ''Hold of One'', the\nhome  of the most devout Dwarven Pantheon worshippers, the keepers of Vûrodrmonir and\nraisers  of  hold hogs. The Granite Dwarves were known for deep study and worship of the\ngods   of  the  Dwarven  Pantheon,  building  both  the  Hul-az-Dagrin  and  the  Argrâstun\nCathedral. Their devoutness eventually led them to isolate themselves by sealing their hold\nwith  runecarved  granite  from the rest of the holds of the East Serpentspine, believing that\nthe  heresy  and  dangers  within  the  Tree  of Stone were too extreme to be ignored. Their\nisolation  was  however  broken by the Chaingrasper Clan, leading to the fall of the hold in\n1439.\n\n==Culture and Customs==\nIn 2203 BA, the legendary Queen Odna II, both Queen of Ovdal-az-Ân and High Priestess\nof  Halanna,  ordered  the  sealing of Ovdal-az-Ân. This measure was not made lightly, but\nthe  heresy  and  dangers  within the Tree of Stone were deemed extreme enough to require\nsuch  a drastic measure. A month-long period of solemn reflection was taken, during which\ntime  the  hold’s  Runeworkers  sealed the gate with specially runecarved granite blocks and\nQueen  Odna  used  Vûrodrmonir  to  weave a complex spell over the gates. It was decreed\nthat  the  gates would only open again after 5,000 years had passed, and the heretical world\nwas  once  again  safe  for  true believers. Thus did the Granite dwarves seal themselves off\nfrom the world, becoming as much a part of mother Halanna as the mountains themselves.\n\nVûrodrmonir  is  a  revered  ancient  artefact  from  Ovdal-az-Ân  said  to be a fragment of\nJoztralanna  herself,  the  Goddess  of  the  Moon  and  origin  of  magic, leftover from the\ncreation  of  Dwarvenkind. Vûrodrmonir was the possession of the High Priest of Halanna,\ntheir  symbol  of  power,  office, and reverence. Its most notable use was to partially create\nand maintain the illusory spell on the gate of the hold.\n\nHold  Hogs  are  a  type  of  Serpentspine  creature,  a distinctive breed of swine that was a\nstaple  meat  of  ancient Aul-Dwarov, and something Ovdal-az-Ân was famed for before the\nFall.  After  their  declaration  of independence from the Jade Empire, many farmers in the\nhold  sought  to  alleviate  manpower  and  supply shortages by breeding larger and stockier\nhogs,  more  fit  for  hauling and pulling wagons. When an outbreak of Rothéflu decimated\nthe hold’s population of Rothé, It only further cemented Ovdal-az-Ân’s reputation as a hold\nof swine by the rest of the Tree of Stone."

 page_events.2229.d: "\n\n==Notable Locations==\nOvdal-az-Ân  was  known  in  ancient  Aul-Dwarov  as  the  hold where faith and piety was\ncultivated,  where  thousands a year were educated in the ways of Gods. The most famed of\nthese  halls  of  education  was  the  Hul-az-Dagrin,  the  Hall of Dagrin. Here the greatest\nminds  were  sent to learn theology, writing, and the best ways to exalt their gods of choice.\nStandards  were  strict, each body, mind, and soul carefully and exactingly measured. Flaws\nwould  not  be tolerated, and if they could not be hammered out upon the anvil of penance,\nthose who bore them would be cast aside.\n\nIn  the  heart  of  Ovdal-az-Ân  sits  a  cavern of immense size, and at its heart an elegantly\nsculpted  dagger  of stone hangs from the ceiling. This is Argrâstun Cathedral, the centre of\nthe  cult  of  Halanna  during  the  height  of  Aul-Dwarov.  The stalactite which Argrâstun\nCathedral is made from has been hollowed out into a massive temple complex dedicated to\nHalanna, and is the seat of power from which the monarch ruled. Surrounded by dozens of\nother  hanging temples to other gods, built from lesser stalagmites or stalactites that radiate\naround  from  it,  the  great  cavern  of  az-Ân  was  a  breathtaking  site,  with  no  part  as\nwonderous or well adorned as Argrâstun.\n\n==History==\n\n\n===Under the Jade Empire===\n\n====Pilgrimage of Halanna====\nIn  Ovdal  Kanzad,  faith  in the old Dwarven Pantheon had been slowly fading, as the gods\nappeared  to have been entirely unable to stop the fall of Aul-Dwarov. Instead, many of the\nAmber  Dwarves  took  up  the Ancestor Worship faith like many of the western holds they\nwere in contact with. This was widely disliked by the followers of the pantheon, and would\nresult  in  the  bolstering  of the cult of Halanna, which was the strongest voice denouncing\nthis “godlessness”. The cultists warned that all this was just a test, and that apostates would\nnot  see  the  restoration  of  Aul-Dwarov  leading  to  the  king  of  Ovdal Kanzad publicly\nrenouncing  his  faith  in the gods in 3859 BA. This led to the cult of Halanna and many of\nthose  who  still  held  onto  the gods to leave in protest, deciding to move to Ovdal-az-Ân,\nwhere  the  cult of Halanna had a strong presence. When they arrived, they were welcomed\nin, strengthening the cult there even further within the hold."

While  none  of  the  holds were attacked head-on, they were all de facto under\nsiege,  as  they  could  barely  reach  any of the other holds. As it became apparent that the\nTree  of  Stone  holds  were  unable  to regain control over the Dwarovrod by themselves, a\nmassive  army  led  by  general  Dourban  Brightbrow  was  rallied in Grônstunad to regain\ncontrol over the Tree of Stone in 2474 BA.\n\nAs  the jade army entered the Tree of Stone, Grimka sent emissaries to the hobgoblin clans\nin  the Jade Mines and on the surface, proposing a united front against the dwarves in 2472\nBA. In return, they promised the Hobgoblins would receive Grônstunad, the grandest hold\nof the east, as their prize.\n\nThe  Jade  army  successfully  destroyed  several  goblin  encampments  in  the  vicinity  of\nHul-az-Krakazol  in  2471  BA,  enabling  the  hold to be supplied through the Dwarovrod\nfrom  the  Jade  Mines  again.  King  Grongnir  I  of  Hul-az-Krakazol  offered  troops and\nsupplies  to  the  army  as  they  prepared  to  move further into the Tree of Stone. In turn,\nGrimka  ordered  a  full  siege  of  Ovdal-az-Ân  in  order  to delay the dwarves as much as\npossible, and sent word to the hobgoblin and goblin tribes of the jade mines.\n\n====Chaos in the Jade Mines====\nAs  the  jade  army  reached  Ovdal-az-Ân  and started to dismantle the fortifications of the\nbesieging  goblins,  the  hobgoblin  armies  from Rahen launched an assault on Grônstunad\nfrom  the  south  in  2470  BA.  The alarm was raised, and messages were sent to the other\nholds in the Jade mines and to the expeditionary force in the Tree of Stone.\n\nWith the attack from the south commencing, the goblins and hobgoblins of the Jade Mines\nalso  initiated  their  attacks,  and  shut off the access routes from the east and west towards\nGrônstunad  in  2469  BA.

He  was  insulted by the Jade armies, as he had not\nrequested  them,  and  their  presence  implied  they  were  unable  to  deal  with  a simple\ninfestation  of  goblins around their hold. After nearly two months of attempting diplomacy\nwith  Snorri, the jade army returned to Hul-az-Krakazol. Unsure what to do next, they sent\nword back to Grônstunad asking for instructions.\n\n===Independence and Isolation===\n\n====Granite Independence and Betrayal====\nWith  the  Tunad  towards  the Jade Mines thoroughly under the control of the hobgoblins,\nthe  holds  of  the  Tree of Stone focused mostly on reclaiming control over the Dwarovrod\napart  from the area around Ovdal Kanzad. King Snorri V of Ovdal-az-Ân decreed that the\nJade  Empire no longer held sway over the Tree of Stone, and declared itself independent in\n2449 BA.\n\nGrôzumdihr  and  Hul-az-Krakazol  however  started organising a large expedition over the\nsurface  to relieve Grônstunad in 2445 BA. They intended to attack the surface settlements\nof  the Hobgoblins, in order to cut off supplies from the besieging forces. As they were sent\nout,  however,  Snorri accused them of plotting to put them back under the heel of the Jade\nEmpire.  As  the  Amethyst-Peridot  expedition was fighting the hobgoblins in northeastern\nRahen,  Snorri  arrived  at  the  gates  of Hul-az-Krakazol with an army, and began a siege.\nEnraged by the betrayal, the Amethyst-Peridot expedition returned to Hul-az-Krakazol, and\nattacked  the  besieging  forces.  In  a bloody battle in 2443 BA, the Granite Dwarves were\ndefeated,  and Snorri V was killed. His body, on the orders of the furious queen Ogdis I of\nHul-az-Krakazol,  was  thrown  into  a pit, and an extension of the Hul-az-Krakazol sewers\nwould  eventually  be  built  to  direct  the waste of the Amethyst Dwarves into what would\nbecome known as Snorri’s Dung Pit."

Under the\ncommand  of  king  Nori  II  of Grôzumdihr, a coalition was again formed between Verkal\nOzovar,  Hul-az-Krakazol,  and  Grôzumdihr  in  2396  BA. He also reached out to Ovdal\nKanzad  and  Ovdal-az-Ân, arguing that the Jade Empire is gone with the death of the High\nKing  and  the  fall  of  Grônstunad, and that this was only about saving Dwarvenkind from\nfurther doom. Ovdal-az-Ân, however, had sealed their gates shut, and the envoys were only\nmet with crossbow bolts.\n\n====Ovdal-az-Ân sealed====\nThe  gates  of  Ovdal-az-Ân  had  not been opened for a long while by 2203 BA, and queen\nOdna  II  decreed  that  they  never  again  would be. The rune mages of Ovdal-az-Ân were\ncommissioned  to  craft an illusory wall over the gate using Vûrodrmonir, and the inside of\nthe  gate  was bricked up. Ovdal-az-Ân would persist alone, queen Odna stated, and would\nonly  open its gates again in five millennia, to see if the world would again be worthy of the\npresence of the Granite Dwarves.\n\n====The Siege of Ovdal-az-Ân====\nThe  entrance  to  Ovdal-az-Ân,  carefully  concealed  and  sealed off from the outside, was\nfound  by  chance  during a slave hunt of a Chaingrasper warband in 1435. Eager for a vast\nsupply  of  dwarven  slaves,  they  immediately organised an assault onto the hold. The first\nlevel  of  the  hold  was  caught  off guard and lost almost immediately, causing the Granite\ndwarves  to  collapse several of the staircases in order to defend the lower parts of the hold.\nAlthough  many  of  the  dwarves  would  fight  to  the  death, many were enslaved, and the\nmovement of large numbers of slaves only attracted more goblins to the siege.\n\n====The Fall of Ovdal-az-Ân====\nFour  years  into  the  siege,  the  dwarves’  defences  were  broken,  and the lower levels of\nOvdal-az-Ân  were  breached  in  1439.

The  Amber  Dwarves  were  known  for their\nmastery  of  forging  cannons  guaranteed  their survival against the goblins that plagued the\narea,  while  being  assisted  by  their  staunch allies in the west, the Topaz Dwarves of Gor\nOzumbrog.\n\n==Culture and Customs==\nIt  is  said  that  the  first  cannon  to  be  forged originated as an experiment by the Amber\nDwarves,  where  they  used  the  vast  deposits  of sulphur and lead in the Tree of Stone to\ncreate  a  devastating weapon. While powerful, the first cannons were expensive to produce\nand  hard  to transport, so the majority were used as emplacements in walls and outposts in\nthe  Tree  of  Stone  to  protect  against invading goblins. The Amber Dwarves shared their\ndiscoveries  with  all  of  Aul-Dwarov  yet  they  kept  the craft of making cannons a secret,\nconstantly  refining  the  designs  and  production  methods,  eventually  producing  mobile\ncannons used to besiege the hobgoblin-occupied hold of Grônstunad in 2394 BA.\n\nIn  much  of  the  amber  found  in  the  Tree  of  Stone,  there  lie  many different insects,\narachnids  and  plants  preserved  inside.  With  every piece of amber being so individually\nunique,  collectors,  scientists and jewellers desperately made their way to Ovdal Kanzad to\nfind the rarest species. While the sales propped up much of the local economy of the hold,\nby  the time of the fall of Amldihr, the luxury of buying such amber was deemed much less\nimportant.  The  nobility  of  Ovdal  Kanzad  would  repurpose these fine pieces of amber,\nembedding  it  in  weapons,  armour and even cannons, turning each into a unique piece of\nart. Some rumours even say that each species within the amber would imbue the items with\nunique qualities and give luck to their aim.\n\nThe  fear of exhausting Ovdal Kanzad’s lead deposits was always close to becoming a reality\nwith  the  goblin  hordes  at  their  gates,  leading  to many different experiments across the\nyears.  The  Amber Dwarves invented Hollow-shelled cannonballs that were developed and\nmodified  to  unique  situations - explosive cannonballs could target attacking siege engines\nwhile  incendiary  shot  could  close  off perimeters on battlefields. The meagre attempts of\nfoes  to combat their cannons would fail continuously as they constantly adapted techniques\nto dispatch any enemy creatively and efficiently."

Their voices could reportedly be heard even over the sound of\ncannon fire.\n\n==History==\n\n===Under the Jade Empire===\n\n====Proclamation of the Jade Empire====\nSoon  after  the  fall  of  Amldihr  in  5895  BA,  Grônstunad  declared  itself  overlord  of\nAul-Dwarov  and  declared  the  West  lost,  establishing  the  Jade  Empire  in  5887  BA.\nOutraged  at  being  passed  over,  many  of  the  holds  of the Middle Dwarovar refused to\nacknowledge the proclamation, and severed ties with Grônstunad. The holds of the Tree of\nStone  however,  tired  of  the  constant  warfare, accepted the proclamation and joined the\nJade  Empire.  Gor  Ozumbrog  and  Ovdal  Kanzad,  the  holds of the Segbandal and Jade\nEmpire  that  were  closest  to  the  border,  still  maintained  close  ties despite the hostile\nrelations of their overlords.\n\n====The First Call for Reclamation====\nIn  5702 BA, High King Moilin I of the Jade Empire, on the first day of his rule, issued the\n“call  for  reclamation”.  He  stated that the western holds must be reclaimed by any means\nnecessary,   and  called  for  the  creation  of  a  reclamation  army.  It  was  led  by  Morri\nSplitbeard,  a noble from Ovdal Kanzad and was to be sent west, marching straight through\nthe  Segbandal,  to  reclaim  Hul-Jorkad  and  Verkal  Kozenad.  If  they were to be denied\naccess  by  the dwarves of the Segbandal, Moilin stated, those dwarves would be enemies of\nthe Jade Empire."

 page_events.2235.d: "\n\nAs  the  reclamation army arrived at the gates of Gor Ozumbrog and demanded to be given\naccess through the Segbandal, they were rebuffed by their incredulous king. As he had been\nordered,  Morri  Splitbeard  began to siege Gor Ozumbrog in 5695 BA, but did not launch\nany  assaults  upon  their  defences  since he had many family and clan members within the\ngates. Unwilling to actually wage war upon them, he kept up the pretence towards the High\nKing  that  he  was  actually  fighting  a  war.  Gor Ozumbrog, whose western access wasn’t\nactually blocked off by the half-hearted siege, began to expand its fortifications in response.\n\nAs  the  half-hearted  siege  of  Gor  Ozumbrog  carried on, Morri Splitbeard grew old and\neventually  died  of  old  age  in  5608  BA.  On  his  orders,  his subordinates fired several\ncrossbow  bolts  into  his chest after his death, and delivered his body to Moilin I, claiming\nthat  he had fallen in an assault against the impregnable walls of Gor Ozumbrog. Defeated,\nMoilin I declared the reclamation had failed, and recalled the army.\n\n====The Second Call for Reclamation====\nIn  5440  BA, Dvepnir II called for a renewal of the Call for Reclamation, putting together\nan  army  of all of the holds of the Jade Empire. He had decided to lead the forces himself,\nand  to  travel  over  what  is  in  modern  times known as the Forbidden Plains rather than\nthrough   the  Segbandal,  aiming  to  reach  and  reclaim  Dûr-Vazhatun.  Departing  from\nGrôzumdihr,  the  Reclamation  army  travelled  through  the  Hreenwegpas, and was never\nheard from again. It is clear that they had failed, but their exact fate is uncertain.\n\n====The Third Call for Reclamation====\nIn  5002  BA, Moilin III declared the third Call for Reclamation, and stated that the holds\nof  the  Segbandal  would kneel before his army as he moved westward or be destroyed. He\nbegan  to  besiege  Gor  Ozumbrog  in 5000 BA, but its defences much improved since the\nfirst  siege  by  Morri  Splitbeard.  Gor  Ozumbrog  was able to withstand the assaults with\nrelative ease causing a protracted siege to begin.\n"

The rest of the reclamation army scattered, and the siege of Gor Ozumbrog was lifted,\nwith Thrindul and his forces settling down in Gor Ozumbrog.\n\n===Amber Independence===\n\n====The Frozenflame Coup====\nWith  logistical  support  from  the  Segbandal,  Ordmir  Frozenflame  organised a coup in\nOvdal  Kanzad  in  4701  BA,  ousting the king Tharvid who was loyal to the Jade Empire,\ncausing  the Frozenflame clan to return to Ovdal Kanzad, and having the Jade-aligned clans\nexpelled  from  the  hold  with  Ordmir crowning himself king and declaring independence\nfrom  the  Jade  Empire. He did not join the Segbandal, instead entering a treaty of mutual\nfriendship  with  Gor  Ozumbrog:  the  Copper Road Pact. High King Vorri IV of the Jade\nEmpire  decided to not contest this as he was unwilling to enter into another conflict in the\nwest, instead inviting the exiled clans to settle in Grônstunad.\n\n====The Pilgrimage of Halanna====\nIn  Ovdal  Kanzad,  faith  in the old Dwarven Pantheon had been slowly fading, as the gods\nappeared  to have been entirely unable to stop the fall of Aul-Dwarov. Instead, many of the\nAmber Dwarves took up the Ancestor Worship like many of the western holds they were in\ncontact  with.  This  was widely disliked by the followers of the pantheon, and would result\nin  the  bolstering  of  the  cult  of  Halanna, which was the strongest voice denouncing this\n“godlessness”.  The cultists warned that all this was just a test, and that apostates would not\nsee the restoration of Aul-Dwarov leading to the king of Ovdal Kanzad publicly renouncing\nhis  faith  in  the  gods in 3859 BA. This led to the cult of Halanna and many of those who\nstill  held  onto  the  gods  to  leave in protest, deciding to move to Ovdal-az-Ân, where the\ncult  of  Halanna  had  a  strong  presence.  When  they  arrived,  they  were  welcomed in,\nstrengthening the cult there even further within the hold."

The Jade Gem was sent to Ovdal Kanzad as a sign of friendship at the behest\nof  Gor  Ozumbrog, and the Citrine Gem was returned to Seghdihr, where it was placed in\nthe royal treasury for safekeeping.\n\n===Chaotic Centuries===\n\n====The Goblintide====\nWith  Grimka  the  Despoiler’s  Goblintide  ravaging  the  tree  of  stone, contact with Gor\nOzumbrog  was  lost  in  2497  BA.  Gor  Ozumbrog had begun the Long Watch where the\nTopaz  Dwarves  eagerly  waited  for  the  goblintide  to  wane  and  for  a connection to be\nreestablished,  yet  only  sparse  contact  was  reestablished  and  never again was the travel\nbetween the two holds the same.\n\n====The Last Expedition====\nWith  the  fall  of  Grônstunad  in 2419 BA, the Dwarves knew that a lot of survivors were\nstill stuck in Vûrdriz-Ândriz and that it was only a matter of time before its defences failed.\nIn  2396  BA,  under  the  command  of king Nori II of Grôzumdihr, a coalition was again\nformed between Verkal Ozovar, Hul-az-Krakazol, and Grôzumdihr. He also reached out to\nOvdal  Kanzad and Ovdal-az-Ân, arguing that the Jade Empire is gone with the death of the\nHigh King and the fall of Grônstunad, and that this is only about saving Dwarvenkind from\nfurther  doom.  Ovdal Kanzad agreed, and sent a small expeditionary force with cannons to\naid in Grônstunad’s reclamation.\n\nThe  army  of  the  four  holds  quickly  dispatched  the much weakened hobgoblins on the\nsurface,  and  soon  laid  siege  to  Grônstunad  in 2394 BA. With aid of the cannons from\nOvdal  Kanzad,  the siege was quite successful despite not cutting off the access routes from\ninside  the  mountains,  and  the  hobgoblins regularly having to repel attacks and throw up\ntemporary  defences  as  their  walls are broken by cannonfire. With the Dwarven attackers\nmostly   situated   in   the   tunnel   access   towards   Grônstunad,   the   hobgoblins   sent\nreinforcements  to  their  kin  on  the surface, and they managed to put together an army to\nlock   the  dwarven  army  inside  the  tunnel.  With  their  supplies  cut  off,  the  dwarves\nabandoned  the  siege,  breaking  through  the army on the surface, and returned home with\ntheir goal unfulfilled."

The  Initial  frontal  assaults  were  almost  entirely obliterated by cannonfire, soon\nturning  the  siege  into  a drawn-out chokehold, with occasional attempts to dig around the\ndefences of the hold.\n\n====Jade Gem Heist====\nClanboss  Dragaz  Wild  Eye  of  the  Bloodscrawl Underkingdom organised another dig in\n198 BA to get around Ovdal Kanzad's defences. And after nearly five years of digging, they\nbreached  the  hold  and  by  pure  chance,  their  tunnel  led  them straight into the Amber\ntreasure  room.  Dragaz  relished  in  his  success as he spotted one item put on a pedestal,\nclearly  given  more importance than all the gold and silver in the room. With the dwarven\nguards  already  coming  into  the treasure room, having heard the commotion, Dragaz had\nhis  goblins  grab  the  Jade  Gem of the Dwarovkron and scurried off. After this successful\nheist,  he  renamed  his  clan  to  Stolen  Gem.  The clan gained much prestige and power,\nbecoming the most important clan under Bloodscrawl.\n\n====Day of Ashen Skies====\nWith  the  Day  of  Ashen Skies hitting the surface world and the Segbandal, Ovdal Kanzad\nwas  virtually  unscathed  and  mostly  caused  chaos  upon  the  goblin clans of the Tree of\nStone.  This  let Gor Ozumbrog to use the time to find an opening to Ovdal Kanzad on the\nCopper  road, reuniting finally in year 10. However, this was only a brief period as in year\n50, the two holds were isolated from each other once again.\n\n====Arrival of the Orcs====\nA  large orcish warband arrived from the west in 818, shaking up the status quo in the Tree\nof  Stone.  They  only  passed by Ovdal Kanzad as they were heavily dissuaded from a siege\nagainst such heavy Amber cannonfire, and moved on to Grôzumdihr."

Hoping  beyond  hope,  he  found  the hold intact and met with the ruling\nking,  seeking  to create a new alliance, and reclaim the Copper Road from the goblins and\norcs   of   the  Tree  of  Stone.  With  much  success,  King  Ombrindal  returned  to  Gor\nOzumbrog,  finding  it  sacked  by  the  Seg Band brutes for his defiance to Jexis. Not long\nafter,  the  hold fell to a horde of goblins that came from the Tree of Stone to enact revenge\nupon  Ombrindal,  with  him staunchly defending the walls so that his people could escape,\neventually leading to his heroic death.\n\nThe  refugees  ended  up  splitting  into  two  groups,  one of which made their way towards\nVerkal Gulan, and the remainder to Ovdal Kanzad. Over the next decade bands of refugees\nwould  make  their  way  towards  both  holds,  though  in  time  the flow of refugees would\nbecome a trickle, and then dropped, before ceasing altogether by 1167.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Once most\nknown  for  it's  romantic  venues  and  poetry  in  the  times  of  Aul-Dwarov,  it  gained a\nreputation  in  ridding the Serpentreach of the orcish infestation with the arrival and rule of\nGerin  Orcrend.  Being  one of the few holds to survive the fall of Aul-Dwarov, the Garnet\nDwarves  survived  by  sealing  their  gates,  and  by  the  love  and  bonds they had for one\nanother, they didn't stoop to infighting or hoarding supplies.\n\n==Culture and Customs==\nThe  culture  of  the  Garnet  Dwarves  was  heavily  tied  to  their  renown  as  the hold of\nromance,  with  their  famous  Tunnel  of  Love  where  many  dwarves  during the times of\nAul-Dwarov  travelled  to  with their partners, with the tunnel being used to kill many orcs\npast  the year 2631 BA thanks to King Ogdis. Many romantic poems and songs are written\nand  performed  within  the  hold which greatly improved people's interest in relationships,\neven at the expense of wealth and power.\n\nWine  is  a  large part of the culture as the drink is associated with love, in turn making the\nGarnet  Dwarves  the  most  wine-loving  of  all dwarves, with even soldiers being supplied\nwith  wine rations. The gems in the mines of Ovdal Lodhum produce a fascinating glowing\ngem, which was once broken in halves and paired between spouses to symbolize their bond,\nlater  being used as excellent light sources in tunnels during skirmishes against the orcs and\ngoblins.\n\nOvdal  Lodhum has a strong tradition of midwives which were trained to exacting standards\nand  once  sought  out  by  royal  families  all across the Dwarovar, but with Aul-Dwarov's\ncollapse,  the  midwives  only  practiced  in  the  Serpentreach  and  eventually  just  Ovdal\nLodhum.\n\n==History==\n"

The hold's first siege began on\n4624  BA, where the ruler, King Lorim ''the Warmheart'' governed with immense love and\nbenevolence.  He  abhorred  conflict yet he was not blind to the threat of the orcs, ordering\nall Garnet Dwarves to return to the hold and sealing the gate, disobeying Arg-Ôrdstun who\nthey were previously subservient to.\n\nHowever,  the  Garnet  Dwarves  were  unlike  the  others  which shut themselves from the\nworld,  as  they  were  bound  by  more  than  heritage, they were bound by love. No dwarf\nattempted  harm  one  another, no dwarf chose themselves over the other. Food was shared\nequally,  where  some would even sacrifice their own shares for those in need. This bond is\nwhat allowed the Garnet Dwarves to survive where others did not.\n\nWith  the  orcs  not  having  much  time  to attempt to siege the hold, as they were actively\nfighting the other dwarves of the Serpentreach, their attempts failed.

With the orcs no longer being a large tide sweeping through the Serpentreach,\nrather  being  groups of stragglers and opportunists.

Any orcs that had attempted entry to the hold\nhad  to  go  through  the  famous  “Tunnel of Love” but instead of love, they found death as\nburning pitch was poured on them.\n\n===The Arrival of Gerin Orcrend===\nGerin Orcrend arrived at the gates of Ovdal Lodhum in 1430 AA, where he was welcomed\nto  the  hold due to his possession of the Sapphire Gem of the Dwarovkron and his feats of\norc  slaying  both  outside  and inside of the Serpentspine. He and his dwarven wife Dwalra\nand  his  adoptive  son  Balgar  lived in the hold until the members of the Assembly elected\nGerin as King after not being able to elect one before him, as his prestige and ownership of\nthe gem made him a perfect fit as ruler."

In  the  codex of the Citrine military, they recorded many rules for the troops to\nfollow,  otherwise,  they would have been dishonourably discharged.

 page_events.2244.d: "\n===Construction of Logrod-Tûngr===\nIn  4408  BA,  the first stones of Logrod-Tûngr or "''River Harbour"'' were laid outside of\nSeghdihr,  on  the  banks of the Suran, formalizing a thousand years of occasional meetings\nand  tent-camp  exchanges  where  the  dwarves  of  Seghdihr come to meet with inquisitive\nGenies  and  their  human  servants,  trading  for foodstuffs, wood, and other rare materials\nsuch as ivory that cannot be found in the Serpentspine. In exchange for these goods was the\nbounty  of  the  Serpentspine  consisting  of  dwarven crafts and artworks, as well as various\ncreatures  and products made from them. Furthermore, the establishment of Logrod-Tûngr\neased  communications  sent to the remaining holds of the Serpentreach, departing via boat\nfrom  the  river  harbour  down  the Suran, before disembarking further down the river and\ntraversing the rest of the journey on foot.\n\n===Segbandalic Golden Age===\nThe  Segbandalic Golden Age began in 3590 BA, with hope in the hearts of Dwarves in the\nMiddle Dwarovar. Populations began to fully recover from the fall of Amldihr, and though\nmany sections of holds had fallen to disrepair, the Segbandal had weathered the ages unlike\nany  other  Dwarven  state,  enduring  two thousand years of struggle and hardship. Despite\nthis,   the  religious  inclinations  of  the  population  slowly  begin  the  long  and  gradual\ntransition to modern Ancestor Worship and away from the Dwarven Pantheon.\n\n===Seghdihr Ascendant===\nWith the gradual increase of surface trade between the Dwarves and the Humans, Seghdihr\ntruly  earned  the  name “Southern Gate” in 2000 BA, as the only fortified point of entry to\ntrade  with  the humans. Whilst Verkal Gulan retained a gate to the surface, it was a minor\npoint  in  comparison to the volume of trade leaving Seghdihr. With food supplies entering\nthe  Segbandal  controlled  by  Seghdihr,  the  hold  began  to gain considerable sway in the\npolitics of the alliance.\n\n===War of the Two Brothers===\nBeginning  in  873  BA, Seghdihr became embroiled in civil conflict due to a legal error in\nthe  inheritance  will  of  the  late  King  Drurngir XVI az-Segh and his 3 sons. While such\nincidents were not uncommon, the scale of which was usually small. In this case, it led to a\n29  year  long  civil  war,  in which King-Claimant Hegomir IV did battle against his older\nlegitimate  brother,  King  Drurnir XIV. It was during this conflict that Hegomir stole away\nthe  Citrine  Gem  from  the  royal  treasury  in  a move to legitimize himself. All this only\nincensed  the  entirety  of  the  hold,  as  Drurnir’s  supporters  chased  Hegomir  out of it.\nDiscovering  that  the  Citrine  Gem  was  not  in  the  areas  he  occupied,  an army under\nDrurnir’s command marched out to do battle."

Following  the  confirmation of their\ndeaths,  Drurngir’s third son, King Gormmor I ''“The Unexpected”'' az-Segh was crowned,\nand called the whole incident “completely avoidable” had anyone actually taken the time to\nwork things through.\n\n===Rise of the Seg Band===\nIn  803  BA,  a  number  of  dwarves  from Hehodovar, Seghdihr, and Gor Vazumbrog had\ngrown  tired  of  hunting  orcs  and  goblins,  and  sought  a different prey. Hearing tales of\nHyena-men  from  the  merchants of the surface, the Seg-Gnelh-Vekerbandal or ''Southern\nGnoll Hunter’s Alliance,'' later shortened to Seg Band, began selling its services to Bulwari\nrealms  under  threat  of gnollish raids. Recruits would usually end up being dwarven exiles\nor rarely even human warriors who joined their ranks after being liberated from slavery.\n\n===Copper and Citrine Wars===\nWith  the  Fall of the Marble Hold of Shazstundihr, the two remaining sources of Dwarven\ninfluences  in  Bulwar  ended  up  being  Seghdihr  representing  the  Segbandal, and Ovdal\nTûngr.  Though the two dominated their respective regions of traditional influence, a series\nof  shadow  trade  conflicts  and  bidding  wars  led  to much rivalry between the two holds\nbeginning  in 270 BA, that will continue all the way to the arrival of Jaher and the blockade\nof Ovdal Tûngr.\n\n===Jexisian Occupation===\nDuring  Jexis'  reunification wars of Bulwar, the Phoenix Empress had made use of the Seg\nBand  mercenary  company  extensively, much as her father did. However, beyond that, she\nsaw  the  wealth  of  the mountains and figured that it could be made to serve her purposes.\nDevising  a  plan,  she  saw  to  it  that  the Seg Band would infiltrate and open the gates of\nSeghdihr  to  her  armies, who had at this time brought order to Azka-Sur. Under the guise\nof  seeking  new  recruits  for  the  Band,  the Seg Band infiltrated the hold and overran the\nGate  guards,  throwing  open  the gates of Seghdihr and allowed her armies to conquer the\nhold in 1139."

The suddenness of it meant that, by the time\nmany  of  the  defenders  realized  it,  the  Hold was already occupied by Elven legionaries,\nBulwari  auxiliaries,  and  Seg  Band traitors. Using the Seg Band as proxy enforcers to her\nrule,  Jexis  effectively  used  Seghdihr's  influence as the leader of the Segbandal to put the\nrest  of  the alliance under her sway, going as far as to dethrone the sitting king of Seghdihr,\nMorzad   az-Segh   and  replacing  him  with  an  exiled  distant  relative,  Morgrend  “The\nSpineless” az-Segh, to act as her legitimizing figure.\n\n===Dissolution of the Segbandal===\nUpon  the  death  of  the  Phoenix  Empress  Jexis  Jaherzuir  much  of  her  empire was in\nrebellion  or  outright  collapse  as  Elizar the Blooded attempted to hold it together. Faced\nwith a collapsing alliance, discontent, and possible rebellion, the Seg Band quickly released\nthe  king  who  had  originally  been deposed, Morzad az-Segh, in exchange for promises of\namnesty, compensation, and an eternal vow to bear no arms in the halls of Seghdihr.\n\nKing  Morzad,  for  all  his  hatred  and rage at what the Seg Band had done, accepted their\noffer. He understood that punishing them would not undo the damages that had been done,\nand  slowly  set  to  work  on  rehousing the refugees. Seghdihr closed its gates to the fallen\nDwarovar  and  instead  became  increasingly  invested  in  the  goings-on  of  their  human\nneighbours  down the Suran. Verkal Gulan, in the meanwhile began to do the same, but no\nlonger  did the gates of the Citadel of Gold open to the Dwarovar, and rarely to the Hero's\nVale. The only exception being to trade with the occasional Mašnsih caravan seeking water\nand  gold  in  exchange  for  Raheni  or  Bulwari wares. This marked the dissolution of the\nSegbandal in 1162, with three holds fallen, and the two remaining, separated.\n\n\n\n\n"

 page_events.684.d: "\nShazstundihr  is a Dwarf Hold in the Serpentreach known as the ''Marble Gate'', the home\nof  master  sculptors  and builders and gate to the land of Bulwar. The hold was known for\nit's skill of working with marble, creating many large and intricate sculptures and buildings\nsuch as the Ancestral Mausoleum of Argor Whitebeard. The Marble Dwarves opened their\ngates  to  many  cultures  from Bulwar and Kheterata, creating a great cultural center where\npeople could coexist together.\n\n==Culture and Customs==\nShazstundihr  traditionally was ruled by the Whitestone Council, a group of 50 of the most\nprominent  dwarves of the hold. The council members rarely changed unless a major event\noccurred,  allowing  Shazstundihr  to  prosper  under  the long-term vision of strong-willed\nleaders.  The  location  of Shazstundihr as the southernmost part of the Serpentreach meant\nthat  it  opened its gates to many different cultures and beliefs. The humans of Bulwar were\nalways  welcome  in  the  marble  hold,  whether  for  trade  or otherwise. Shazstundihr had\nalways managed to maintain an enduring peace with its neighbors of the surface realms, and\nin  its  heyday  was  a  great  cultural  center  where  many  cultures  from Bulwar and even\nKheterata could be found.\n\nThe  Marble  Dwarves  were renowned for having many master sculptors and builders from\nthe  hold who made many creations. The grand Marble Gate to the hold of Shazstundihr is\na true wonder of the world. Made up of two giant blocks of marble, each door is estimated\nto  weigh  over  1500  tons.  Meticulously  maintained,  the designs and decorations on the\nsurface   of  the  gate  show  the  immense  skill  of  the  Shazstundihri  stoneworkers.  The\nAncestral  Mausoleum  of  Argor  Whitebeard  was  a  structure  which  contained detailed\nstatues  of  the most famous ancestors along with a 30 foot statue of Argor Whitebeard, the\nfounder of Shazstundihr.\n\nMarble  works  were  also  built  in  Bulwar,  with  works such as the old walls of Aqatbar,\nmuch of the island city of Azkaeliš, and the great fortress of Azka-szel-Azka. Time, war and\ndevastation,  as  well  as  the  desperate  scavenging  has wiped away much of this work, but\ntraces  of  the  Shazstundihr  still  remain  everywhere.  Many  modern  buildings  stand on\ndwarven  foundations,  and  dwarven  stonework  decorations  can  still be spotted on some\nancient walls."

Having lost their Emperor, Aldan called for peace with Aul-Dwarov\nand  broke  the  siege of the Hold and in 6200 BA, the Precursor Elves were called back to\nAelantir for reflection.\n\n===Aftermath and New Enemies ===\nAs  the  Precursors  left  the  Dwarovar,  one  elf,  Ducaniel still remained in the depths of\nHul-Jorkad.  He  had  created  the  orcs  which  had devastated the Western Dwarovar and\ndestroyed  Amldihr by 5888 BA. With an orcish victory and Ducaniel leaving for Aelantir,\nin  5400 BA, the orcs breached the Argrod Junction after much fighting against the dwarves\nof  the  Serpentreach,  including the Marble Dwarves. The orcs slowly advanced across the\nSerpentreach  and  with the leadership of Arg-Ôrdstun, the Marble Dwarves followed them\ninto battle, defending every inch of rail they could.\n\nBy  4538  BA,  the  forces  of  the  holds  of  Ovdal  Lodhum  and  Verkal  Skomdihr were\nwithdrawn  from the war which forced the remaining holds to levy their populations for the\nwar,  taking  a  large  toll  on  Shazstundihr. By 3800 BA, seeing the futility of fighting, the\nHolds of Shazstundihr and Orlghelovar elected to retreat to their respective holds and close\ntheir gates.\n\n=== The Relic ===\nWhile  unable to reach Dwarovrod anymore, the Marble Dwarves thrived and had a golden\nage.  Much  of  the  architecture of Bulwar was created using marble from Shazstundihr, its\nstyle  apparent  in  man  palaces  of  the  God Kings. In 2400 BA, one of the God Kings in\nparticular  had  offered  his  patronage  to  the  Marble  Dwarves  to build him magnificent\nmarble  statues.  They  had  obliged  and  were offered a relic as payment, one that allowed\nthem  to enchant their tools to require less repairs which greatly helped the master builders\nand  sculptors.

There  were many\nattempts  to  destroy  it, but they all failed, any dwarf that tried to remove it from the hold,\nwould break down to dust before they could even walk out of the room.\n\nMany  dwarves  died,  others  abandoned  the  hold.  The  relic would gradually lose all its\npowers  over the years, but the damage was done. Shazstundihr was finally uninhabitable by\n271  BA,  with  scavenging  goblins  eventually  making  their way to the hold and squatting\nthere, with the ancient relic reduced to a headpiece for the tribe’s clanboss.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

 page_events.685.d: "\nTuwad-Dhûmankon  was  a dwarf hold in the Jade Mines known as the ''Second Domain'',\nthe  home  of  Serpentbloom  cultivation, culinary excellence and decadence. The Emerald\nDwarves  were  known  for  their  history  from scrounging for food to developing the most\nelegant  of  culinary  traditions  which  even  the lower classes could indulge in. Their food\nsource  came  mostly  from  the  bountiful  Serpentbloom  found in the Serpentspine which\nthrived  with  the  techniques  of  calcite irrigation and the use of Emerald Sunstones. They\nmanaged  to  feed  much  of  the  Eastern  Serpentspine  after  the fall of the Serpent’s Vale,\nrelieving  the  food  shortages  in the Jade Empire. Their tragic fall came in 908 BA as they\nfailed to repel the powerful hobgoblin mages who tunnelled and overran the hold.\n\n==Culture and Customs==\nFollowing  the  tragic  fall  of  Aul-Dwarov’s western government, the Eastern Serpentspine\nremained  relatively intact, ruled from the Hold of Grônstunad. Despite avoiding the worst\nof  the  collapse,  the  eastern holds had suddenly lost their primary source of food with the\nwest.  To  stave  off  imminent starvation, the Emerald Dwarves utilised every edible scrap,\nevery  fungus  bulb, and every dreadful beast’s carcass. It was along this path of deprivation\nthat Tuwad-Dhûmankon developed a unique branch of the culinary arts, born of asceticism\nand  continuously improved upon until the exotic tastes and textures of the surface could be\nperfectly mimicked with locally–sourced ingredients.\n\nThe  fine  line  between  the masses and nobility held true in the pristine hold, however the\nelegantly   refined   yet  robustly  simple  culinary  traditions  of  Tuwad-Dhûmankon  have\nbrought  into  being  a well-fed lower class who indulge in the uncommon pleasures of life.\nfull  bellies,  cultivated  palates, and decadent bliss. The nobility of Rahen could only look\non in envy as the common Emerald Dwarf consumed mouth-watering dishes unheard of on\nthe  surface.  Even  in  the  turbulent  times  of  the  fall  of  Aul-Dwarov  did the Emerald\nDwarves  enjoy  their  blissful  ignorance,  enjoying  their  pleasures  in  a  time of war and\ndevastation.  The  culinary  sports,  though  exclusive  to  the  top  chefs  of  the hold, were\nregularly  held  in the form of entertainment for foreign diplomats and emissaries, to whom\nthe  products of the tournament are often offered as a form of hospitality. It was in this way\nthat   talented   chefs  achieved  fame,  fortune,  and  favour  throughout  both  the  Eastern\nSerpentspine and parts of Rahen."

Despite\nthe  relative  abundance  provided  by the northwestern caverns, Serpentspine agriculture is\nbarely  enough  to  feed  a  single  hold,  let  alone an entire empire. Relying on the natural\nmembrane  of porous calcite that conveniently lines the ceiling of much of the western Jade\nMines  helped  alleviate  their  problems  of  no  access  to  natural groundwater in enough\nquantity   to   facilitate   large-scale  crop  irrigation.  This,  combined  with  the  Emerald\nSunstones  often  utilised,  allowed  the  Emerald  Dwarves  to cultivate a myriad of surface\ncrops  that  provided  better  yields,  and  more  importantly,  better  tastes than the typical\nSerpentbloom.\n\nWith  the many great dwarven clans all across the Dwarovar, each bore iconic heraldries to\nrepresent  their house and accomplishments of their ancestors. The majority of designs and\nheraldries  came  from  artisans  of  Tuwad-Dhûmankon  who relished creating a myriad of\nextravagant  patterns  for  the  nobility  of  their  hold and the richest clans of Aul-Dwarov.\nFrom  banners  which  decorated  large swathes of every hold to the garments of nobles and\nsoldiers,  the  designs  of  the  Emerald Dwarves spun far and wide. In the most devastating\nperiod  of  monstrous  invasions  in  the  Dwarovar,  the standards of all the surviving clans\nwould  still  remain,  displaying the old clans and their legacy, with their promise to fight to\nthe last dwarf and protect their way of life.\n\n== History==\n\n\n===Under the Jade Empire===\n\n====The Great Gardens of Tuwad-Dhûmankon====\nWith the loss of the Serpent's Vale, the food imports to the eastern holds had ceased, vastly\nreducing  the  amount of available food. Individual holds had made efforts to increase their\nown  food  production  in order to compensate, but the variety in the dwarven diet was still\nquite underwhelming compared to the days of Aul-Dwarov. In order to try and remedy this,\nHigh  King  Vrorri V ordered a grand project to expand the gardens of Tuwad-Dhûmankon\nin 3987 BA, in order to produce vast amounts of Serpentbloom of all kinds. The expansion\ntook centuries, and over time the amount of available food would come close to the time of\nAul-Dwarov,  and  more  varied.

The alarm was raised, and messages were sent to the other\nholds in the Jade mines and to the expeditionary force in the Tree of Stone.\n\nWith the attack from the south commencing, the goblins and hobgoblins of the Jade Mines\nalso  initiated  their  attacks,  and  shut off the access routes from the east and west towards\nGrônstunad  in  2469  BA.

They reclaimed the Dwarovrod with relative ease, and\nwere  elated  to  find Tuwad-Dhûmankon surviving and thriving. The expected assault from\nthe  hobgoblins  had  never  come,  and  the  great  food  gardens had easily sustained their\npopulation.\n\n===The Drizdahvad===\n\n====The Proclamation====\nGrôzumdihr,   Hul-az-Krakazol   and   Tuwad-Dhûmankon   agreed   to  the  three  shields\nproclamation, or Drizdahvad in 2135 BA, promising that they will all cooperate in coming\nto  the  others’  defence  in  case  of  an  attack and keeping the supply routes between their\nholds  over the Dwarovrod safe from raiders. In order to safeguard the supply line between\nTuwad-Dhûmankon  and  Hul-az-Krakazol,  both  ends of the tunad were fortified in 2100\nBA,  to  ensure  that  no goblins or hobgoblins could move between the Jade Mines and the\nTree  of  stone.

The siege\nbegan   in   913   BA,   a   slow   constriction  of  the  tunnels  and  raids  against  outlying\ncommunication  posts.  The  Tunad  was  too fortified to assault directly, as was the garden\nhold  itself,  but  there  were  countless  miles  of  tunnels  abutting the roads from there to\nTuwad-Dhûmankon,  and  slowly,  one by one, these tunnels came under the control of the\nhobgoblins.  The  dwarves  did  not at first realise this was occurring - after all, why would\nthey suspect such behaviour, when their fights against the warbands were proceeding well in\nthe north.\n\nAll  the  while,  goblin  miners  were put to work pincushioning fortifications progressively\ncloser  to  the central hold, and soon enough clashes between hobgoblins and dwarves were\nbecoming  a  regular matter. But Shakuin was careful not to let her advance on the hold be\nknown,  and  ordered  her  forces  to pull back strategically whenever the dwarves rallied in\nsubstantial  numbers,  maintaining  the  appearance  of  grinding  stalemate. But her scouts\nstudied  the  dwarven  defences  and  communications  networks, learning their secrets, and\nencroached  ever  closer to the hold. In this way, she began to bury Tuwad-Dhûmankon for\nalmost three years before anything was suspected to be amiss.\n\nThe  siege  became  apparent  to  the kings of Tuwad-Dhûmankon when Shakuin made her\npower   play   -   after   years  of  preparation,  her  warbands  descended  on  three  critical\ncommunication  hubs  that connected Tuwad-Dhûmankon with Hul-az-Krakazol and seized\nthem.   But   rather   than   destroy   them,   Shakuin   set   her   warriors   to  maintaining\ncommunications  with  the  remainder  of  the  Drizdahvad  as  if  nothing  were amiss, and\nHul-az-Krakazol  did  not  initially  suspect anything was wrong, for Shakuin’s warriors had\nlearned   the   dwarven   communications   schemes  in  their  long  quiet  encirclement  of\nTuwad-Dhûmankon.

Some  few  reached the army, but the royal line of Tuwad-Dhûmankon was not\namong them.\n\nFinally,  on the last day of 908 BA, Tuwad-Dhûmankon's main gates were shattered and the\narmy  of  Shakuin  entered  the  city.  It  is  said that the combined Drizdahvad relief effort\ncould  see  the  shining  lights of the hold going dark one by one as the hobgoblins took the\npalace,  the gardens, and the villas from the few who remained in the hold, and that the few\nEmerald Dwarves who escaped wept as their home was lost to them."
 page_events.686.t: "Hold of Verkal Dromak 1 / 3"
 page_events.686.d: "\nVerkal  Dromak was a dwarf hold in the Jade Mines known as the ''Citadel of Dreamers'',\nthe  home  of esoteric dreams, fantastical magic and occult rituals. The Malachite Dwarves\nwere  known  for their odd practices with dreams, believing many to be signs that predicted\nthe  future.  Dreamers,  who were powerful mages that used their power to peer beyond the\nconscious  world  were a peculiarity to the other dwarves as they slept for very long periods\nof  time and caused a myriad of effects in the hold. The most famous effect of these dreams\nwas  after  the  hold had fallen in 2286 BA, as the invading goblins killed the dreamers still\nin  deep  slumber  which unleashed the Dream of Vengeance, which cursed the invaders for\nover three thousand years.\n\n==Culture and Customs==\nVerkal  Dromak  was  home  to  quite  a few practitioners of the arcane arts, many of them\nstrangely  proficient  in  Divination  as  opposed  to  the  traditional  Rune  Magic  of most\ndwarves. These mages kept to themselves, using their powers for their own esoteric ends or\nbizarre  whimsies. A select few served the Hold and used their magical dreams to peer into\nthe minds of enemies and dissidents.\n\nDue to the Malachite Dwarves being naturally gifted in magic compared to the rest of their\nkin,  it was commonplace for them to see spells and parlour tricks around Verkal Dromak.\nBut  as  visitors  from  other  holds would arrive, they were amazed by them, as rune magic\nwas not used for such frivolous activities. This gave the Malachite Dwarves an idea to send\nmagic shows to their neighbours in the Eastern Serpentspine, to show others the impressive\nconjurations  of  Verkal  Dromak.  Many  would  spend their gold and make deals to bring\nback  these  travelling  shows.  Yet  as  people  got  tired  of  seeing  the  same tricks, more\ndangerous  and  difficult  magic  was  needed  to  calm  the  masses,  leading to unfortunate\naccidents,  such  as  a  particularly famous incident where some volunteer participants were\nreplaced by Bnunins.\n\nA  diplomat from Grôzumdihr once wrote that attempting to speak civilly with a Malachite\nDwarf  is  like trying to shake hands with an orc. The Malachite Dwarves believed that the\ndwarven  language  was  not  expressive  enough  to describe many feelings, leading to them\ndreaming  up  new  words  for  the  most  specific  feelings  and thoughts such as the innate\nprimal  need  to  avoid  paying  taxes. It is said that they also took inspiration for their new\nvocabulary  from  the  many  eldritch  beings  they  saw  in  their  dreams, leading to many\nconflicting   sources  being  brought  up  for  the  correct  pronunciation  of  the  seemingly\nfantasised words."

No such lake had been found, but the Fisher King's faithful still maintained the Cave\nMarines  as  an  elite  force, ready to respond to any alleged citizen sightings of the kraken’s\nglowing  eyes  appearing  in  the  dark caves. The Malachite Dwarves were known for their\nlove  of  sleep, and in 6237 BA, Storin the Sane decreed that all citizens of Verkal Dromak\nwere  entitled  to  two  half-hour  naps  per  workday.  Viewed  as  preposterous  across the\nstrictest  holds,  they  laughed  that  nothing  would ever be done in Verkal Dromak, but to\ntheir  surprise  productivity rose by a noticeable margin. Some Malachite Dwarves claimed\nthat  they  were able to finish calculations and even physical crafts in their dreams, much to\nthe  disbelief  and  chagrin  of  diplomats  who did not appreciate the naps occurring in the\nmidst of negotiations.\n\nCenturies  of  communing  with  forces  beyond the veil have given rise to an abundance of\neccentric  practices among the occultists of Verkal Dromak. As bewildering as these rituals\nwere,  they  have  proven  surprisingly  effective in communing with ancient dwarven spirits\nand  even  echoes  which were summoned from the Western Serpentspine after the invasion\nof  the  orcs.  These  ghosts ranged from evil spirits spewing curses and insults to those that\nwoke  them  to the saddest stories of lone defenders repelling their invaders, but all of their\nmultitude  of  stories were recorded in sacred tomes kept by the hold. The occultists would\noften  commune  with  Echoes  of  recently fallen holds, and would perform rituals to curse\nand disturb their invaders, to pay for the horrors they had committed.\n\n==History==\n\n\n===Isolation and Fall===\n"

While  there had been on-and-off attacks against Verkal Dromak, a collection\nof  goblin  clans  set  up a large-scale siege of the hold in 2301 BA, and started consistently\nlaunching  probing  attacks  against  the  walls.  It  being  a  comparatively smaller and less\ndefensible  hold,  the situation seemed dire as they were isolated from their allies far in the\nTree of Stone.\n\n====Dromak Exodus====\nIn  desperation,  King  Thrun  IX  of  Verkal  Dromak  made  a  deal  with the ogres of the\nDemon  Hills, giving them a very large amount of gold, supplies and books from the vaults\nof  the  hold in return for safe passage through their lands in 2290 BA. The majority of the\ninhabitants  of  the hold evacuated, but a large number remained behind, unwilling to leave\ntheir  home behind and headed towards Verkal Ozovar. They knew they had no real chance\nof beating the goblins back, so instead, they started planning their revenge.\n\n====Fall of Verkal Dromak and Unleashing of the Dream====\nWith  most of the defenders gone, Verkal Dromak fell within four years in 2286 BA. Most\nof  the  defenders  fought  to the death, and those that did not were enslaved by their goblin\nconquerors.  A  large  number,  however,  were  still  dreaming, and did not wake. As they\ncouldn’t  take  them as slaves, the goblins simply killed them and as they did, the Dream of\nVengeance was released upon them.\n\n====The Jade Rivalry====\nWith  Verkal  Dromak  taken,  and the hobgoblins disunited, the goblins of the Jade Mines\nfound  themselves  in  a  position of relative power. It did not last long however, as in their\nminds,  the dream of the Malachite dwarves had taken hold. They started seeing things that\nwere  not  there, all designed to turn them against one another. Fights broke out constantly\nover  imagined  insults  or  thefts,  friendships  and  families  were  torn  apart  for  unclear\nreasons,  and  a  general  air  of  mistrust  hung over the entire hold. Eventually, this divide\ncrystallised the goblins into two sides, which would over time become two clans: Wild Eye\nand  Blackstep.  Blackstep  would  eventually win this conflict, forcing Wild Eye out of the\nhold and starting a rivalry that would last for many centuries."

While  being  a  humble hold in the empire, it saw a experienced a\ngolden age under the Segbandal, allowing to use it's wealth to aid their allies and trade with\nthe  people  of  the  surface.  Protected  by  the  Three  Golden  Gates,  the Gold Dwarves\nsurvived  the  orcish invasion of the Dwarovar and later isolated themselves from the world\nand transitioning into a republic.\n\n==Culture and Customs==\nThe  Gold  Dwarves  built  three  Golden  gates  protect Verkal Gulan, the ''Hero's Gate''\nfaces  the  outside  world  and  leads into the vale, decorated with great scenes of battle and\nvictory  over  our  many  foes,  it had often been beset by harpies and gnollish raiders. The\n''King's   Gate''   faces   the   Dwarovar,   and   is   adorned   with   examples  of  dwarven\ncraftsmanship  and  engineering.  It  was  opened  during the time of the second Segbandal,\nwhen  the  Gold  Dwarves  aided  their  allies  with  funds  and  troops.  But when the orcs\nbreached  the  rails  in  816, the gate was closed, and it has sat closed since their isolation.\nThe ''Miner's Gate'' faces the depths, it is the gate that provides access to the deep reaches\nof  Verkal  Gulan and to the great treasures that lie beneath its foundations, decorated with\ndepictions of all the treasures and horrors of the deep earth.\n\nThe economy of Verkal Gulan was driven by gold. The vast quantities of the metal that the\ndwarves  retrieved  from  the depths of the mountains were so great that they threatened the\nstability of the nation's treasury. To create some relative stability, the council of clans had a\nmassive  vault  constructed  where all gold mined in the citadel would be stored. Then they\ncreated  the  institution  of  the  Vault  Magistrates,  warrior-bureaucrats  whose job was to\ncarefully  measure  the  quantities  of gold in the vault and to always track the stores. These\nmagistrates  had  the  solemn  duty  of  determining when it would be wise or unwise to tap\ninto the Citadel's gold supply, and by their skill they stabilised Verkal Gulan's economy.\n"

While they were never as influential as in the days of Jaher, mercenaries\nwere  employed  by  the  clans  of  the Golden Citadel in various positions of society.

In 816, the holds of Seghdihr and Verkal Gulan had a quarrel over the\nusage  of  the  gold  mined  in  Verkal  Gulan  and  where  to best use it. Worried that this\nquarrel  would  lead to military action, Verkal Gulan withdrew its forces from Hehodovar.\nSeghdihr  feared  that  Verkal  Gulan  was preparing to attack them and thus also withdrew\ntheir  forces  from  Hehodovar.

It also housed many thieves and assassins\nin  the  Dwarovar,  who  provided  their devious services to any dwarf who could afford the\nprice. Known to have believed in fate and the "''Grand Scheme''", the Kozenadi were seen\nas  superstitious,  yet  also  proved themselves to have notoriously bad luck, revealing plots\nprematurely even with their notoriety for intrigue.\n\n==Culture and Customs==\nVerkal  Kozenad  was  extremely  flexible with their laws and policies both in proposal and\nacceptance,  allowing  them  to pass new laws and reforms quickly, much to the jealousy of\ntheir  neighboring holds. However, in reality, the officials did not enforce the new laws nor\nobeyed  them themselves, rather using the renown to seem that they are above the common\nquarrelsome  dwarves.

The Opal Dwarves were not known to be\nthe  most  loyal  bunch,  often being bribed by the clans of other holds to side on Amlharaz\ndebates  or  clan  feuds.  This  made  them  untrusted  by  many  but  also  served as useful\naccomplices  in  the passing of vital reforms which were at a deadlock, but only if the Opal\nDwarves were offered the most competitive prices.\n\nIt  is  said  that  the  Kozenadi  had  notoriously  bad  luck,  it seemed that in the history of\nVerkal  Kozenad  any  plot  within  the state came out prematurely. It was said that Morzad\nRingbeard,  an  aspiring thief planned a heist to rob the Aegis of Arg-Ôrdstun before it was\nadded  to  the  Dwarovkron.  The Aegis was kept in a vault within its hold, guarded by one\nhundred  of  the  greatest  Diamond  Dwarf soldiers.

Fear  overcame  him and as he shuffled around, he\nkicked  some  dust  in  the  air  and  let out a sneeze, which echoed out in the tunnel which\ntriggered  the  last  support  to collapse, burying the thieves under the vault which in reality\nwas just a decoy."

After the war, Lorevarn II Rewantis saw himself victorious, king of Redwood\nand  Enteben  and  ruler  of  the  Kingdom  of  Redfort  by  conquest, and so on the first of\nCastanmark  of  the  year  900 he proclaimed the end of the wars between brothers and the\nfoundation of the Kingdom of Lorent, a kingdom for all the Lorentish peoples.\n\nAs part of the refoundation of this unity and having reunited Lencenor by blood and by act,\nLorevarn  abandoned  the  old arms of the Rewantis and took Lorenan's Rose Banner as his\nown, thus founding the house of Lorentis.\n\n=== Inner Conflict ===\nWhen Prince Lorevarn died of cancer his father, King Rewan VII, left with a sole daughter\nas  heir  of  house  Lorentis,  changed  the laws of succession of the kingdom to be of equal\ninheritance,  thus  avoiding  the possibility of Dameria attacking Lorent on the claim of his\nnephew  king  Arrel  of  Dameria.  As  such,  he  was followed by his sole daughter, Queen\nReánna I Whiterose.\n\nThe  conflict  began  when  Reánna died, for she had three children: Reánna, Lorevarn and\nKorvin,  and  the  two  younger  men  did  not  recognize  their  sister's  right  to rule. The\nfollowing  war,  the  Lorentis  War  of Succession, lasted for 5 years and saw the Entebenic\nvassals  of  Lorent  flock  to  Lorevarn's  banner.  Queen Reánna II won the war, yet house\nLorentis  was  reduced  to  only  two  heirs:  Prince  Rewan  (the  future  Rewan VIII) and\nprincess Laurenne, who didn't marry.\n"

This\npresence  of  foreign  invaders  among Epednar lands, primarily justified by concern for the\npotential  rise  of  a  Dragon Cult, would ultimately create resentment and pave the way for\nthe  rise  of  Chief Hubinach, who through charisma, conviction and skill managed to rally\nthe disparate Epednar tribes.\n\nBy  1076,  virtually  all  Epednar tribes had united behind Chief Hubinach. At a summit at\nPaihubi  the  tribe  leaders confirmed Hubinach's status as War Chief and followed him on\nhis invasion of the Ynnic Empire.\n\n==The Invasion==\nThe  invasion  started in 1076, and reports about 'the largest horde of Epednar the Ynn had\never  seen' soon reached Emperor Carodin I in his capital Arverynn. By the time the report\narrived,  all  Imperial  outposts  in  the Expanse had been either overrun or, as was the case\nwith  Mara  Luar, laid siege to and isolated deep within hostile territory. The Epednar now\nmarched  to  attack  the  Ynnic  civilian  settlements  located  west  of  the  Ynn  River, and\nCarodin  I  gathered  his armies to defend said settlements, leaving the Imperial outposts to\ntheir fate and accepting their garrisons as casualties.\n\nCarodin gave chase to Hubinach, but his horde refused to meet the Imperial army head on,\ninstead preying on Ynnic settlements and employing scorched earth tactics.\n\n==Hubinach's Defeat==\nAfter  nearly  two  years  of  skirmishes,  the  war  reached  a turning point when Carodin's\ngeneral,  Camovac  Konyrzab,  was  able  to  secure  the defection of the Nansa tribe. This\ndefection   forced   Hubinach's   horde  to  confront  the  Imperial  army  at  the  Battle  of\nKonyrhrada,  near  Vels  Fadhecai, in 1078.

After  the  Castanite Exodus settled around modern Ourdia, Humac became one\nof  the  elders  of  the  tribe,  focusing on preparing its defenses against any attacks that may\ncome  from  the  Bulwari  gnolls.  He  led  the  charge  against the First Xhazobine’s forces\nduring  the  battle  of  Burning Hill and successfully scattered the gnoll forces thanks to the\nintervention of a silver dragon, brought about by his son Castan, though he was slain by the\nXhazobine after a short duel.\n\n== Early Life ==\nThe  exact  date  of  birth  of Humac is unknown.

Knowing that they would never be welcome in the continent due to their condition\nas  escaped  slaves, Humac and his peers devised a plan to follow the coast of Bulwar north\nand  flee  through  Western  Bahar  into  the western lands, Humac himself was assigned as\ncommander of the Exodus’ rearguard.\n\nTheir  path  took  them to Brasan where Humac played an important role in the defeat of a\ncoalition  army  formed by gnolls and humans from the various polities of western Bulwar.\nHumac,  who  had  proven  his skills when fighting superior forces during the retreat of the\nSalahad  Gate,  was  given  command  of  a strong contingent of Castanite warriors and was\ntasked   with   reinforcing   the   army’s   right   wing   against   gnollish   skirmishers.  His\naccomplishments  during  the battle of the Suran Delta earned him the personal trust of the\nCastanite  elder  who  was  in  charge of the right wing during the battle and he became his\nprotegee.\n\n=== Siege of Anzabad ===\nDuring  the siege of Anzabad, Humac and a set of trusted Castanite warriors he met during\nthe  battle  of the Suran Delta boarded fishing boats looted from Djinnkalis and snuck into\nthe  city  of  Anzabad  through  its  harbor a few days before the arrival of the Exodus. They\nwere  able  to blend with the diverse population of the city, which was filled with slaves and\npirates  from  all  around  the  east Diven coasts. When the Exodus sieged the city, Humac\nand  his  warriors  attacked  the city gates from the inside and opened them for the Exodus,\nallowing its main forces to pass through the city walls while the forces of Anzabad were still\nunprepared  for  direct assault. After the sack of the city and the liberation of its slaves, the\nCastanite Exodus headed north once more.\n\nHumac  earned  great  repute for his deeds at Anzabad. Having faithfully served the Exodus\nfor  over  a  decade  as  a commander, he had earned the trust of most of its elders and was\nseen  as  a  hero  by  the  slaves  he  had  fought to free. Humac was offered the position of\ncommander  of  the  Exodus’  main  army,  but  he  preferred  to  stay  as  the  leader of the\nrearguard, where he believed himself most useful due to his experience."

Though  almost no records remain with details of these battles, Humac likely played\nan  important  role  as  he  protected  the  Exodus from harpy raids. The Exodus eventually\nreached the Kingdom of Uak and skirted around the city of Aqatbar. The Exodus’ numbers\nhad swelled so much that the gnolls were afraid of incurring too many losses in open battle,\nwhich  would  leave  the  Uaki  open  to  attack  by  other gnollish kingdoms. They instead\nadopted  a  strategy of swift raids against the Exodus, seeking to capture at least a few slaves\nfrom  its  swelled  numbers.  Most  of the Castanite command was surprised that the proud\nUaki  did not meet them in open battle, but Humac’s quick thinking and ability to adapt to\nnew  circumstances,  a  skill he had developed over the two decades spent commanding the\nrearguard, ensured that the Exodus took minimal losses from the raids of the Uaki gnolls.\n\n=== Birth of Castan ===\nAfter   the  Exodus  crossed  into  the  borders  of  Ovdal  Tûngr,  Humac  was  among  the\nrepresentatives  that  met  the copper dwarves who had been their benefactors both in terms\nof  supplies  and  financing  during their trek north. During their stay in the lands of Ovdal\nTûngr,  as  their  scouts  scoured  the lands of modern day Western Bahar and Ourdia for a\ngood  place  to  settle,  Humac received news that he had had another son whom he named\nCastan.\n\n== Settlement of the Burning Hill ==\nThe  Castanites eventually chose to settle in the Burning Hill, the very same hill that would\neventually  host  the  fortress  of  Bal  Ouord  decades  later.  The  Castanite elders invited\nHumac  to join their ranks, an offer that Humac gladly accepted as there was no longer any\nneed  for  him to command a rearguard. Humac and other militarily minded elders led the\nExodus’  warriors  in  their  petty wars for territory against the Old Riverfolk, the natives of\nthe  banks  of  the  river  Dostanesck. The territories controlled by the Castanites and their\nRiverfolk  rivals  waxed and waned during the next 15 years, the alliances and rivalries they\nmade were fickle."

The tales of slaughters\nof  thousands  upon thousands of humans to fuel dark rituals reached the concerned ears of\nthe  Castanite  elders.  Humac along with many other elders wished to prepare the Burning\nHill  against  a  possible invasion by the Xhazobine. The Exodus thus reinforced the fort of\nthe Burning Hill and prepared their warriors through constant training.\n\nOnly  two years after the warning, the Xhazobine’s hordes ravaged the upper levels of Ovdal\nTûngr  and  laid siege to its lower levels, where the copper dwarves fortified themselves and\nconstantly  engaged the forces of the Xhazobine in an effort to retake the upper levels of the\nhold.  As the siege dragged on for over a year, the Xhazobine led an expedition towards the\nDostanesck  river  in  order  to  pillage  the  region  and  bring back supplies. The terrified\nCastanites and Riverfolk united in the defense of their region against gnollish raids.\n\n== The Battle of the Burning Hill ==\nIn  651  BA,  Humac  and  the  rest of the Castanite and Riverfolk elders decided to gather\ntheir supplies and goods at the fort of the Burning Hill, hoping that the prospect of another\nsiege  would  dissuade  the  Xhazobine  from  further  raids and have her retreat south once\nmore.  This  plan  was  based  on the Castanites’ knowledge of gnollish warfare throughout\ntheir trek through Bulwar.\n\nBut the Xhazobine worked differently. She set up her raiders around the fort at the Burning\nHill and used her dark magic to create a ring of demonflame around the bottom of the hill.\nHer  plan  was  not to defeat the fort’s garrison and pillage its supplies, but rather to let the\nflames  consume  them all as a show of force to any Bulwari slaves who may hope to flee as\nthe Exodus did.\n"

An  infuriated  Humac,  unwilling to die while cowering from the flames in the\nfort’s  cellars, riled up the warriors of the Castanite and Riverfolk tribes. He told them that\nit  was  best  to  die  facing the flames head on and many agreed. They prepared themselves\nand opened the gates of the forts.\n\nThe  cackles  of  the  frenzied  gnolls  resounded  throughout  the  nearby  hills  while  they\nwatched the Castanites’ futile attempt at a charge. Humac flew down the hill flanked by his\nmany  children,  amongst  whom  was  the  young  Castan  who frantically prayed for divine\nintervention.  Humac  watched  as  his  son’s  prayers  were answered; a silver dragon swept\ndown  the  hill  and blew the demonflame back at the gnollish host, their frontline perished\nengulfed  by  the  flames  spawned  by  their  Matriarch  and  the Xhazobine herself was set\naflame, receiving grievous wounds.\n\nThe  Castanites  did  not relent in their charge against the demonflame, emboldened by the\nintervention of the silver dragon and their blind faith for their gods, who they truly believed\nhad  intervened,  they  charged  through it and came out on the other side unharmed. They\ntore  through  the scattering gnolls who were surprised to see that the charging footmen had\nnot been hampered by the flames that had struck them only a moment earlier.\n\n=== Humac's Fate ===\nAs   Humac’s  slew  one  burning  gnoll  after  the  other,  the  old  warrior  recognised  the\nXhazobine  among them. He charged towards her with mace and shield in hand in order to\nfinish  her off but he did not know of the true strength of the Xhazobine. The gnoll entered\ninto  a  frenzy,  enraged  by  her  pain  and  defeat,  Humac  delivered  powerful blows that\nwould've  killed  most  gnolls,  but  she  shrugged  off the pain and damage and a surprised\nHumac  saw  how  the  gnoll,  empowered by demonic strength and her force of will, began\ncountering  all of his blows. The Xhazobine tore away Humac's shield then hewed him with\ngreat force.\n"

This  came  at  a  great  cost,  both  in  elven  life and\ndevastation  to  the  territories  of  the Malacynn and Gajnynn rivers, which would soon be\neclipsed by the cities of the Trojvare League to their east.\n\nBy  304  AA  the Trojvare League had been reformed into the Kingdom of Vareynn and his\nfounder,  King  Munaqir  the  Pious,  had  been  usurped by his son Komerjon. In 312 AA\nKomerjon  declared  war on Malacnar and he was met by King Vatrevid IV of Malacnar at\nthe Battle of Drevonbost.\n\nThe  battle  proved disastrous for Malacnar, whose warriors were encircled and slain to the\nlast.  Komerjon claimed kingship of Malacnar, which hadn't been ruled by a Dolindhan in\nalmost 200 years.\n\n==Start of the Uprising==\n\nThe  Malacnari defied Komerjon's entrance into their city and rallied behind Varmeljon, a\ncompanion  of  the  late Vatrevid. After a day of street-to-street fighting Varmeljon is slain,\nand a general loyal to Komerjon is installed to govern Malacnar.\n\nUnknown  to  Komerjon,  this  was  only  the  beginning of the Hundred Years' Uprising, a\nseries  of  rebellions  that would ignite whenever Malacnar's governor died, and that would\nrequire  Vareynn  to  intervene  and  quell the city to install a new general as governor once\nagain."

She\nspecializes  in  Bulwari  history,  as  well as Harpy history, culture, language, and relations.\nSome  of  her  early  works regarding Harpy Queendoms and important harpy artifacts, she\nlater  began  research  into  the  broader  history  of Bulwar, and took particular interest in\nresearching  and  studying the life of Jexis. Born to a Hydiranyan harpy mother who visited\nthe  city  of  Bulwar  following  a family disagreement and subsequently fell in love with its\narchitecture,  people,  and  culture, and a sun elven trader father, who was known to be fair\nand kind and sold fine silks and fabrics, who stayed for the city’s diversity and history.\n\n===Parentage===\nHydiranya  was  born  to  a Hydiranyan Harpy mother named Ishtara Kindwing, and a Sun\nElven Father named Alvarion Elanzuir, in the city of Bulwar in 1887 A.A.\n\nIshtara  Kindwing  was  born  in  the  Harpy  Hills,  and  was  raised  alongside  10 sisters.\nFollowing  an  incident at school where she received minor injuries after getting into a fight\nwith  another classmate, she returned home only to find several of her sisters destroying her\nroom,  attempting  to  find  a  missing  piece of jewelry that they had suspected Ishtara had\nstolen.  They proceeded to get into a verbal argument, which almost escalated to a physical\naltercation  until  her  mother  had  stepped  in.  She  scolded  the  other  sisters  for  their\ninconsiderate  and  hurtful  action, and took Ishtara aside, gave her some Bulwari currency,\nand  told  her  to  go  south  and  explore  the world. Her reasoning for doing so, as said to\nIshtara  was  to  "go  and  see  the world for what it is, and not what you have seen all your\nlife.  Go  see  the  beauty and the kindness, which accompanies the ugly and the cruel." At\nthe  age  of  22  Ishtara  left the Harpy Hills and arrived in Bulwar, scared yet excited, as it\nwas the first time she had been in a large city.\n\nAlvarion  Elanzuir  was  born  in the city of Bulwar to parents of low nobility. Raised as an\nonly child, his parents put great expectation on him to hopefully lift their family to a higher\nsocial standing. Alvarion repeatedly scored high on school tests and examinations, however\nhe would later describe this as "a boring, and meaningless period of my life." At the age of\n24  he admitted to his parents his dissatisfaction and unhappiness, to which they responded\nunderstandingly  and  with  compassion,  much  to  his  surprise. He left to join a group of\nseveral  traders,  whom  he  later fell out with following his discovery of their underhanded\nand  predatory  business  practices.  As an independent trader, he made his living by selling\narticles of silk clothing, fabrics, and small pieces of jewelry."

 page_events.2281.d: "\n\nIshtara  met  Alvarion  while  browsing  a  popular  market,  in  fact  not  intending  to buy\nanything.  Ishtara  was  at  first  drawn  to the beauty of the the Raheni fabrics on display in\nAlvarion's  stall. Alvarion began explaining the history and the production methods used in\ncreating  the  fabric,  as  well  as another necklace that Ishtara was interested in. As the two\nbegan to converse about the fabric, they soon found themselves to be conversing about their\nlives,  and  each  other.  As  Ishtara  began  to leave, as the day was ending, Alvarion, in an\nexcited  and  yet  professional  tone,  gifted the necklace to Ishtara. Ishtara, embarrassed at\nbeing  gifted  such  an  expensive  piece  of  jewelry,  thanked  Alvarion  and headed home,\nintending to go to his stall again the next day.\n\n===Early Years===\nHydiranya  was named after the founding matriarch of the Hydiranyan Harpies, Hydiranya.\nHer  mother  reportedly  named  her  Hydiranya,  as  the  matriarch was always a source of\ninspiration and strength to her when she was going through difficult times.\n\nHydiranya  spent her early years exploring the city of Bulwar, accompanied by her parents.\nHer  mother taught her of the culture and customs of her siblings and family, as well as the\ngeneral impression of harpies by humans and elves around the world. Her father taught her\nof  various cultures, customs, and languages, as well as the art of bartering and of empathy.\nAt  the  age of 18 her parents wished for her to explore the world, and urged her to go on a\n"journey  across  Halann" to meet new people and experience all the world had to offer for\nherself.  Prior  to  her  leaving she promised her parents that she would return to visit often\nand would send them gifts and letters detailing her experiences.\n\n===Adventures around Halann===\nHydiranya  was  raised  to  be  an  adventurous,  curious,  and  sharp  but  kind  child, and\nfollowing  an  incident  when  at  the age of 18 when she accidentally crash landed and was\nsubsequently  chased  by  a  duck  holding a knife in its mouth, she met Beppad Yen Rogai,\nwho  was  amused  by  the whole situation and invited her to join the Order of Chroniclers\nafter  taking  note  of  her curiosity and sense of adventure. After numerous journeys across\nBulwar,  Haless, Cannor, and Aelantir, and interviewing and recording the testimonies and\nstatements  of  hundreds  of  various  harpies,  she  was  returning back to Bulwar when she\naccidentally  got caught up during the coup d’etat orchestrated by Nuršin Gillu-Gameš and\nseveral  other  scholars  and Mašnsih mercenaries. Following this, she was interrogated and\nafter  concluding  that  she  had no part in the incident, was let free, albeit a bit ruffled and\nshocked.  She  did  however manage to speak with Nuršin Gillu-Gameš and was fascinated\nand  moved  by  the  idea  of  democratic  Surakeš, which she to this day still advocates for,\nciting  the  historical  oppression faced by humans in Bulwar. Following her return back to\nBulwar,  Hydiranya  has  been  actively  studying  the  various religions of the world, as her\nparents  did  not  seek  to  push  their own respective religions on to her, and wanted her to\ndiscover and explore on her own."

Once when asked what\nshe  thought about Aelnar, she proceeded to angrily explain her views for 10 hours straight,\nwhich  burnt  out  a  record  number  of  editors  and “sent dread” throughout her previous\npublishing  house  so  much  that  they  banned her indefinitely. Another incident occurred\nwhen  she was asked about her experience as a Harpy in Bulwar, to which her response was\nso  emotional  and  heartfelt  that  the interviewer couldn’t stop crying for 30 minutes, after\nwhich  it  was  actually  found  out  that the interviewer was actually allergic to Hydiranya’s\nfeathers,  as  they  had  accumulated  dust  following a journey to get some bread, the exact\ndetails  are  unknown,  however  Hydiranya  has  repeatedly stated it was “some really good\nbread”.\n\nShe  gained  the  alias “The Harpynn” when she flew over the city of Arverynn, accidentally\nsetting  off  several  warning  alarms  and  alerting  nearly every guard in the city as she was\nneither  authorized  to  fly  there,  nor  easily  identifiable due to her unique feather design.\nSome thought that it was Varlengeilt before seeing her size and concluding that it must have\nbeen  a  harpy.  This  incident  was  repeated  throughout  the  Ynn  in  several major cities\nincluding,  Vareynn,  Bostynn,  and  Svemel,  as  she  had  forgotten  about  needing  to  be\nauthorized  every  time. It should be noted however that Hydiranya was fascinated by Ynnic\nculture  and  Ruinborn  as  a whole, and sought to study the various cultures, religions, and\ncustoms as much as she could.\n\nDuring  her  time in Arverynn, she visited the home of Amarien Heartseeker, bringing with\nher  a  gift  of  tea  leaves she bought from Port Isobel. While waiting for the water to boil,\nHydiranya inquired about the history of her time with Hiderion Tonanzuir, and the Sunrise\nEmpire,  as  well  as  Jaerel  and  the  Eastern  Phoenix Empire. The two engaged in a deep\ndiscussion  about  the  history  of  Haless,  and  the  Sun  Elven influence on the continent.\nFollowing  this conversation, Amarien works offered Hydiranya one of her works regarding\nthe  Sunrise  Empire,  for which she was deeply grateful. After departing, she continued her\njourney  up  the  Ynn, deciding to head to Haless, before realizing she did not pack enough\nfood  and collapsing from exhaustion and nearly drowning at sea, only to be picked up by a\nCannorian  trading  ship  headed  for  Tianlou.  Upon  realizing the crew and captain were\nGawedi,  she  suddenly  felt better and flew all the way to the city of Azkare, a feat that was\nconsidered by many to be quite impressive, if not incredibly dangerous and reckless. When\nlater  asked  why  she  suddenly  felt  better,  she  said that it was due to an extreme lack of\ninterest in being saved. To this day this answer has baffled doctors."

Following  this  exchange  L.B Stamh gave\nHydiranya  a  watch  to  which Hydiranya simply looked up at the sky and said to him “Oh\nthis  is  wonderful,  I will be keeping this”. She immediately lost the watch. Following this\nmeeting L.B Stamh and Hydiranya have been good friends ever since.\n\nPrior to visiting the city of Arverynn on her journey up the Ynn, she visited West Tipney as\nshe  heard  they had “some damn good pie”. She sought to see if the pie was indeed "damn\ngood",  and  while  waiting  for  her  pie she was immediately hit by the fact that the entire\nrestaurant  smelled  completely  of  tobacco, and that the entire place was filled to the brim\nwith  smoke.  Regardless  of  this  fact,  she  greeted  a  halfling, who introduced himself as\nTempo  Foolfoot.  She  was  not  aware of the fact that it was him in fact that baked the pie\n(his  mother  owned  the  establishment),  however  upon  realizing  this  she  proceeded to\nfervently and loudly proclaim that “Halflings are the best thing to ever happen to Halann!”.\nThis  was embarrassing for both her and Tempo, and the owner of the restaurant proceeded\nto  kick  her  out, much to the dismay of the other restaurant goers. Afterwards she realized\njust  how  much  smoke  had  been in the restaurant, and she spent the next 3 days trying to\nwash  the  smell  of  tobacco  from  her  feathers,  which didn’t work since it was absolutely\neverywhere.

These new neighborhoods in the Luna cities like\nIndlebury  and  Bluehart  would  also  draw  in  the  local  halflings as customers and trade\ncontacts.

In  reaction, halflings of the Empire have learned to invoke\nobscure  laws,  regulations,  and  loopholes  in  order  to  preserve their holdings as well as\nbecoming  well-trained  in  the  art  of  rhetoric;  Beepeckers in particular are infamous for\ntheir fast-talking dialect intended to confuse strangers and obfuscate their intentions."

 page_events.753.t: "Iskerag Vulshor 1 / 3"
 page_events.753.d: "\nIskerag  Vulshor  (commonly  referred  to  as the ''Feast of the Gods'') is a set of religious\nbeliefs  and  practices deeply interwoven into Fathide Ogre culture and society. Three main\ntenets  compose  the  core  of  this  strain  of  ogre spirituality: the existence of a soul in all\nliving things, the ability to gain the attributes of a being from the consumption of said soul,\nand  the  belief  that ogres are the inheritors to the godlike status of their Giant creators via\ntheir ancient rebellion.\n\n==Beliefs==\nGreat  importance  is  placed  on  the maintenance of one’s soul (alsu) according to Iskerag\nVulshor teachings. Traditionally the most efficient way of doing this was to consume others,\nthus  adding the strength of their soul to yours. However, ritual celebrations would become\nincreasingly  more prominent over time as ogre society centralized and civilized as a means\nof  keeping  one’s  soul  in  balance.  Another  popular  belief that emerged in the late 15th\ncentury  was  that  a  devout pursuit of diverse and high quality foods, as opposed to simply\nchasing raw quantity, was an equally acceptable way to nourish one’s soul.\n\nThough  the  teachings  that  make  up  Iskerag  Vulshor  are  silent  on the question of the\nafterlife,  there  are  still a number of traditions that surround death in the religion. Passing\none’s  soul  down  when  another  consumes  it  is  popularly  seen as a sort of immortality.\nWhile  in  antiquity this gave license for a surprisingly lax societal view on murder, so long\nas  the  victim  was  properly  consumed;  however, as ogres centralized over time, funerary\ncannibalism  would  become  increasingly more popular, especially in conjunction with the\ntightening of criminal laws.\n\nIf  a  body  was  allowed  to  rot  away  without  its soul properly being passed down, it was\nbelieved  that  the  spirit  would  likewise  rot  and fester, being forever bound to haunt the\nphysical  world.  Likewise,  cremation is seen as a high desecration by adherents to Iskerag\nVulshor.\n\n== Skurkoklism =="
 page_events.2286.t: "Iskerag Vulshor 2 / 3"
 page_events.2286.d: "\nPopular  amongst  the  wild  ogres  of  the  northern  forests,  Skurkoklism  is  an extremist\noutgrowth of Iskerag Vulshor beliefs. While all ogres believe themselves to contain a spark\nof  the divine within their souls, passed down to them from the original consumption of the\ngiants,  Skurkoklists have taken this belief to an almost messianic extreme. They assert that\nshould  ogres  assert  their  inherited  dominion  over  all  Halann,  and consume every last\nsapient  being,  that  they will be able to ascend into gods in their own right. Consequently,\nSkurkokli  movements would typically organize around charismatic leaders who claimed to\nhave particularly high concentrations of Giants’ soul within them.\n\n==Feasts==\nA number of holidays are celebrated by hosting massive communal feasts (uprala), the most\nimportant of which are listed below:\n\n*The  Ogrish  New Year (Nykha Tolutsdi) is typically welcomed in by the commemoration\nof  the  original  Godsfeast (Iskeraguprala). This celebration is typically the most elaborate\nfeast  of  the  year.  Non-ogres  may attend, but are traditionally not allowed to eat the food\nprepared  for  observing  ogres;  the  consumption of the True Giants is what sets the Ogres\napart  (and  above),  and  its  reenactment  may  be  one  of the few rituals that can truly be\nconsidered sacred to them.\n*Feast  of  Mourning  (Uprala  vra  Gluvum):  A somber occasion, at its core this feast has\nbeen a day to remember and honor lost family members and friends. Traditionally seen as a\ndate  to  forgive  debts and grudges. As the day comes to a close, revelers are encouraged to\nadopt  an  attitude  of  abandon,  as  if  the  current  celebrations  are the last they will ever\nattend.  Beginning  with  the  widespread  immigration  of Mossmouth Ogres into the Ogre\nValley,  this  feast  has  also  served  as commemoration of the extermination of the Swamp\nogres  at  the  hands  of  the  Castanorians, and as such has seen use as a means of building\nbridges   with   centaur   minorities,   and  recently  harpy  immigrants  (DO  NOT  invite\nEscannis).\n*Days  of  Hunger  (Ghisg vra Vulshim): remembrance of the years of hunger following the\nDoAS,  and  the miraculous crash of the True Giant city in Magharma. The codification of\nthis  feast  was  seen  as  the  beginning  of the idea that giants sacrificed themselves for the\nogres.  Observants  will  typically fast anywhere between a day and a week leading up to the\nfeast.  Different  communities will alternatively remember the extinct Sandmaw Ogres with\nthis feast, Uprala vra Gluvum, or both."

 page_events.2287.d: "\n*Feast  of  Unity  (Uprala  vra  Urtanob):  commemoration  of  the  ascendance of Ziltagh\nGravelhide  to  Mengurkha  and  the  rescue  of  Ogrekind  from  the  brink  of yet another\nruination. Seen as a day to remember Ogrish unity and resilience in the face of hardship.\n\n== Organization==\nLacking  any  sort of (living) deities to devote themselves to, Ogrish “priests” are entrusted\nwith  two  primary  functions.  Most  importantly,  they  administer  funerary  rites  to  the\ndeceased  to  increase  the potency of their soul upon consumption. However, most of their\ntime  is  spent fulfilling their secondary function: the preparation of food (bodies included)\nfor  feasts. Their religious fascination with food has led to the development of an extremely\ncomplex ogrish gastronomic culture.\n\nThe  isolated  Mossmouth  Ogre culture had developed along significantly different lines of\nreligious thought. As Maghargma became an increasingly desirous location for Mossmouth\nimmigration,   the   doctrinal   clashes   sparked   by  the  newcomers  prompted  the  most\nprominent  priests  within  Maghargma  to  convene  a council to establish a basic canon of\npractices.  The  end  result of the council would lead to the creation of the Iskerag Vulshor\nCentral  Seminary.  Though  originally  empowered with the ability to certify priests, it has\nsince  grown to become a premier culinary academy; 1813 marked an important year in its\nhistory with the grand opening of a Bal Vroren campus.\n\n==Additional Notes==\n\n*Relations  with  Mountain  Watchers:  Despite  sharing  common  ancestry  and  creators,\nOgrish  and Trollish beliefs are almost completely incompatible. Where the Trolls wait for\nthe messianic return of their True Giant creators, the Iskerag Vulshor believe that there are\nno  remaining  True  Giants,  and  holding  on  to  such a hope cheapens the worth of their\nsacrifice.\n*Lefthand  Path: There is currently heated academic debate surrounding the hypothesis that\nHalessi  views on chi (namely the idea that all beings contain a life force), were introduced\nthrough  Horned  Ogre  migration  into  the  region,  especially  given the close similarities\nbetween Iskerag Vulshor and the Lefthand Path."

After  the  failure  of his guardian, the Legionary Commander Erelessa to secure\nBulwar  in  the  Partition  of Kalib, he was educated in the ways of the Masnsih people and\nthe Jexisian legionaries, and would later become the head of the Desert Legion.\n\nHaving  united  the  separated  Jaherian  and  Jexisian  legionaries,  and  their Masnsih and\nHarpy    allies,   he   would   gain   control   of   the   Salahad   after   vanquishing   Zokka\nDevourer-of-Suns  in  personal  combat.

This  theory  was  supported  by the clear resemblance of\nJaddar  with  his  uncles  and  grandfather like this testimony from the archives of Vulzin of\nElizna: "when I saw him I renegated my doubts in a second, for I saw in the boy, the young\nJaerel   playing   in  the  palace  of  Bulwar,  and  the  distinct  traits  that  Jaher  possessed\nthroughout  his  life  : his magnificent golden hair, an aquiline nose and a general look that\ninspired  respect  and  the ability to rule". For the proponents of this theory, the identity of\nthe  father  remains  the biggest mystery, because Jexis was not known to have favorized any\npeculiar   elf  in  her  court.  Various  claims  have  emerged  over  the  centuries,  singling\nBluetongue from Varivar, Birsartan the Secretary or even the old Gelmonias of Buranun.\n\nFrom   this  theory,  the  Ioriellian  pamphlet  written  by  the  "Anbenncost  Burgher",  an\nanonymous  retelling  of  the  Decade of Masks, suggested that Jexis conceived a child with\nher  half-brother,  Elizar  the  Blooded.

For Bulumren, Jaerel did not\nactually  die  in  the  Halessi  Wars  but eloped with the dragon with whom he had a child.\nThis child would then have been taken by Nathalyne to Anbenncost.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

 page_events.764.d: "\nThe  Jade  Empire was the title claimed by the hold of Grônstunad after the fall of Amldihr\nwhich  asserted  its  overlordship  over  Aul-Dwarov.  It  first  established  itself in the East\nSerpentspine, uniting the holds of the Jade Mines and the Tree of Stone while attempting to\nalso  subjugate  the  holds  of  the  Middle  Dwarovar.  Proclaimed  in  5887  BA, the Jade\nEmpire  made  the reclamation of the West Serpentspine a priority, declaring three calls for\nreclamation  to  reconquer lost holds. The Jade Empire was dissolved in 2319 BA with the\nfall of Grônstunad to the goblins and hobgoblins.\n\n== Rough Beginnings ==\n\n=== First Arrival ===\nWith  the East cut off from Amldihr and Er-Natvir in 6000 BA, Grônstunad became the de\nfacto  capital  of eastern Aul-Dwarov, and King Orrin IX of Grônstunad took charge of the\npush  to  reclaim  Hul-Jorkad. Due to proximity to front lines, the hold of Gor Vazumbrog\nwas placed under martial law and attempts were made to break through to Hul-Jorkad.\n\nIn  5989 BA, Orrin IX raised a large army consisting mainly of troops from the Jade Mines\nholds  and  started  sending them into the Middle Dwarovar, starting to try and dig through\nthe blockades of the Tunad. Meanwhile, he sent messenger convoys towards Amldihr to get\nan idea of how the west was faring.\n\n=== Centralisation of Power ===\nThe  push  towards  Hul-Jorkad  had  progressed very slowly, partially hampered by lack of\nrailroad  maintenance  slowing  down supplies from the east. In 5963 BA, in order to unify\nthe  war  effort,  Grônstunad  took  steps  to  institute a proper chain of command over the\nholds  of  the  east,  which  was  met with some resistance by powerful dwarven clans of the\nMiddle  Dwarovar,  who  had  been  pulling  power  towards  themselves  with  the  central\nauthority from Amldihr gone.\n\n=== Proclamation of the Jade Empire ==="
 page_events.2291.t: "Jade Empire 2 / 10"
 page_events.2291.d: "\nSoon  after  the  fall  of  Amldihr  in  5895  BA,  Grônstunad  declared  itself  overlord  of\nAul-Dwarov  and  declared  the  West  lost,  establishing  the  Jade  Empire  in  5887  BA.\nOutraged  at  being  passed  over,  many  of  the  holds  of the Middle Dwarovar refused to\nacknowledge the proclamation, and severed ties with Grônstunad. The holds of the Tree of\nStone  however,  tired  of  the  constant  warfare, accepted the proclamation and joined the\nJade  Empire.  Gor  Ozumbrog  and  Ovdal  Kanzad,  the  holds of the Segbandal and Jade\nEmpire  that  were  closest  to  the  border,  still  maintained  close  ties despite the hostile\nrelations of their overlords.\n\n=== The Calls for Reclamation ===\nIn  5702 BA, High King Moilin I of the Jade Empire, on the first day of his rule, issued the\n“call  for  reclamation”.  He  stated that the western holds must be reclaimed by any means\nnecessary,   and  called  for  the  creation  of  a  reclamation  army.  It  was  led  by  Morri\nSplitbeard,  a noble from Ovdal Kanzad and was to be sent west, marching straight through\nthe  Segbandal,  to  reclaim  Hul-Jorkad  and  Verkal  Kozenad.  If  they were to be denied\naccess  by  the dwarves of the Segbandal, Moilin stated, those dwarves would be enemies of\nthe Jade Empire.\n\nAs  the  reclamation army arrived at the gates of Gor Ozumbrog and demanded to be given\naccess through the Segbandal, they were rebuffed by their incredulous king. As he had been\nordered,  Morri  Splitbeard  began to siege Gor Ozumbrog in 5695 BA, but did not launch\nany  assaults  upon  their  defences  since he had many family and clan members within the\ngates. Unwilling to actually wage war upon them, he kept up the pretence towards the High\nKing  that  he  was  actually  fighting  a  war.  Gor Ozumbrog, whose western access wasn’t\nactually blocked off by the half-hearted siege, began to expand its fortifications in response.\n\nAs  the  half-hearted  siege  of  Gor  Ozumbrog  carried on, Morri Splitbeard grew old and\neventually  died  of  old  age  in  5608  BA.  On  his  orders,  his subordinates fired several\ncrossbow  bolts  into  his chest after his death, and delivered his body to Moilin I, claiming\nthat  he had fallen in an assault against the impregnable walls of Gor Ozumbrog. Defeated,\nMoilin I declared the reclamation had failed, and recalled the army."

 page_events.2292.d: "\n\nIn  5440  BA, Dvepnir II called for a renewal of the Call for Reclamation, putting together\nan  army  of all of the holds of the Jade Empire. He had decided to lead the forces himself,\nand  to  travel  over  what  is  in  modern  times known as the Forbidden Plains rather than\nthrough   the  Segbandal,  aiming  to  reach  and  reclaim  Dûr-Vazhatun.  Departing  from\nGrôzumdihr,  the  Reclamation  army  travelled  through  the  Hreenwegpas, and was never\nheard from again. It is clear that they had failed, but their exact fate is uncertain.\n\nIn  5002  BA, Moilin III declared the third Call for Reclamation, and stated that the holds\nof  the  Segbandal  would kneel before his army as he moved westward or be destroyed. He\nbegan  to  besiege  Gor  Ozumbrog  in 5000 BA, but its defences much improved since the\nfirst  siege  by  Morri  Splitbeard.  Gor  Ozumbrog  was able to withstand the assaults with\nrelative ease causing a protracted siege to begin.\n\nAn  Amber Dwarf general by the name of Thrindul Frozenflame and his retinue defected to\nthe  Segbandal,  claiming  that  they  should  not be fighting their own kin and in 4874 BA,\nthey  had  attacked  the  besieging  reclamation army in the back, killing High King Moilin\nIII.  The rest of the reclamation army scattered, and the siege of Gor Ozumbrog was lifted,\nwith Thrindul and his forces settling down in Gor Ozumbrog.\n\n=== The Frozenflame Coup ===\nWith  logistical  support  from  the  Segbandal,  Ordmir  Frozenflame  organised a coup in\nOvdal  Kanzad  in  4701  BA,  ousting the king Tharvid who was loyal to the Jade Empire,\ncausing  the Frozenflame clan to return to Ovdal Kanzad, and having the Jade-aligned clans\nexpelled  from  the  hold  with  Ordmir crowning himself king and declaring independence\nfrom  the  Jade  Empire. He did not join the Segbandal, instead entering a treaty of mutual\nfriendship  with  Gor  Ozumbrog:  the  Copper Road Pact. High King Vorri IV of the Jade\nEmpire  decided to not contest this as he was unwilling to enter into another conflict in the\nwest, instead inviting the exiled clans to settle in Grônstunad.\n"

 page_events.2293.d: "\n=== The First Ogre Incursion ===\nAs  ogres  began  to  migrate  into  the  foothills near Hul-az-Krakazol, some of the human\nbands  that  lived  there requested aid from the Amethyst Dwarves. Delighted to fight these\nformidable  opponents,  the  dwarves  agreed,  and  fought and defeated the ogres in several\nopen   battles.   Clearly   outmatched,  the  ogres  abandoned  their  incursions,  expanding\nelsewhere in Rahen.\n\n== The Golden Age of Grônstunad ==\n\n=== Prosperity in the Capital ===\nWith  a  long  period  of  peace  and  stability  behind  it,  the  Jade Empire prospered, and\nGrônstunad  entered  a  golden age in 4100 BA. With the best and brightest dwarves of the\neastern  holds  moving  to the capital, Grônstunad was expanded and improved greatly, and\nthe outlying Vûrdriz-Ândriz expanded along with it.\n\n=== The Great Gardens of Tuwad-Dhûmankon ===\nWith the loss of the Serpent's Vale, the food imports to the eastern holds had ceased, vastly\nreducing  the  amount of available food. Individual holds had made efforts to increase their\nown  food  production  in order to compensate, but the variety in the dwarven diet was still\nquite underwhelming compared to the days of Aul-Dwarov. In order to try and remedy this,\nHigh  King  Vrorri V ordered a grand project to expand the gardens of Tuwad-Dhûmankon\nin 3987 BA, in order to produce vast amounts of Serpentbloom of all kinds. The expansion\ntook centuries, and over time the amount of available food would come close to the time of\nAul-Dwarov,  and  more  varied.  Because  of this, the cooks of Tuwad-Dhûmankon would\nbecome experts at their craft, and highly sought after in the other eastern holds.\n\n=== The Second Ogre Incursion ===\nWith  the ogres having become more established in central Rahen in around 3900 BA, they\nhad  begun  a  second incursion into northern Rahen, much bigger and better prepared than\nthe  first  one.  The Amethyst Dwarves were mostly avoided, and repelled in what few open\nbattles  took  place.  Grôzumdihr, meanwhile, simply kept its gates closed, and fired at any\nogre  that  came into reach of its trebuchets. The ogres maintained control over the region,\nsubjugating  the  few  humans  that  lived  there,  and  established  a  number  of  magically\nprotected strongholds."

 page_events.2294.d: "\n\n=== The Pilgrimage of Halanna ===\nIn  Ovdal  Kanzad,  faith  in the old Dwarven Pantheon had been slowly fading, as the gods\nappeared  to have been entirely unable to stop the fall of Aul-Dwarov. Instead, many of the\nAmber  Dwarves  took  up  the Ancestor Worship faith like many of the western holds they\nwere in contact with. This was widely disliked by the followers of the pantheon, and would\nresult  in  the  bolstering  of the cult of Halanna, which was the strongest voice denouncing\nthis “godlessness”. The cultists warned that all this was just a test, and that apostates would\nnot  see  the  restoration  of  Aul-Dwarov  leading  to  the  king  of  Ovdal Kanzad publicly\nrenouncing  his  faith  in the gods in 3859 BA. This led to the cult of Halanna and many of\nthose  who  still  held  onto  the gods to leave in protest, deciding to move to Ovdal-az-Ân,\nwhere  the  cult of Halanna had a strong presence. When they arrived, they were welcomed\nin, strengthening the cult there even further within the hold.\n\n=== The Forays past Vûrdriz-Ândriz ===\nA  number  of attempts were made to crack open passages to the north of Vûrdriz-Ândriz in\n3784  BA,  to  explore  the  caverns  below  the  mountains  there.  The hope was to find a\nsuitable  location  for  the creation of a new hold, from where the plentiful tin in the region\ncould be mined. Tin had been relatively rare in the east, and with the West Serpentine lost,\ninitial  mapping  efforts  were  quite  optimistic,  noting  the near absence of goblins there.\nSoon,  however,  they  found  out  the reason for this. The caverns were frequently home to\nseismic  activity,  which  made  building there extremely difficult. What was more, caverns\nregularly  collapsed,  formed,  and shifted, making mapping them virtually impossible. The\nmountains were then named the Range of the Damned, and these plans were abandoned.\n\n=== The Construction of Verkal Ozovar ===\nAfter  several fruitless attempts to find a suitable location within the Range of the Damned,\nscouts  were  sent  out  towards  other  mountain  regions  in  the  vicinity  of  Grônstunad.\nEventually, a location within the Phokhao Range was found, and construction of the hold of\nVerkal   Ozovar   commenced   in   3500  BA.  Because  of  the  distance  between  it  and\nGrônstunad,  most of the necessary materials were obtained locally, and the colony was run\nmostly autonomously."

Using  rune  magic, the expeditionaries managed to break the glamours\nobscuring many of the strongholds, and immediately began besieging several of them.\\n\nAfter  many  decades  of  slowly  losing  strongholds  to  the  dwarves, the ogre magi finally\nsucceeded  in  improving their glamouring spells, protecting the surviving strongholds from\nthe  dwarven  expeditions. At this point in 3353 BA, however, their control over the region\nhad  been  mostly lost, and the ogres only kept contact with their direct tributaries in order\nto  avoid  detection.  There  were  still  occasional  skirmishes  with the dwarves, and those\nstrongholds that are still found by chance were quickly besieged and destroyed.\n\n=== First Tin Expeditions ===\nWith  the  Phokhao  range  also not containing the tin the Jade Empire needed, prospectors\nagain  looked  north  to  the  Range  of  the  Damned  in  3461  BA. As permanent mining\nsettlements  could  not  be  constructed,  mining  operations would be mobile, to make the\nprocess as safe as possible. After a period of earthquakes, prospectors would have been sent\nout  to find newly exposed tin veins, map them, and send word for a caravan to be sent. All\nthe   exposed   tin   ore   would   be   mined,   and  the  caravan  would  quickly  return  to\nVûrdriz-Ândriz before the next series of shocks.\n\n=== Human Migration ===\nWith  the power of the ogres severely limited, and the dwarves uninterested in taking direct\ncontrol  over  the region, by 3180 BA, human tribes began to migrate into Northern Rahen\nin  large  numbers,  establishing  independent  towns  and  villages all over the region. The\nogres   still   occasionally   attempted   to  subjugate  them  or  bully  them  into  becoming\ntributaries,  but this constantly attracted the attention of dwarven expeditionary forces, who\npromptly  found  and destroyed the ogre stronghold attempting this. This began a period of\nfriendly  contact  and relations between the dwarves and humans, as the dwarves recognised\nthat  the  humans  establishing  themselves  could  permanently  break  the  strength  of the\nremaining ogres."

 page_events.2296.d: "\n\nFollowing   several   centuries   of  casual  cooperation  between  humans  and  dwarves  in\ncombating the ogres, many of the human tribes started seeking the explicit protection of the\nJade  Empire.  Former  ogre  tributaries  and independent later arrivals alike petitioned the\ndwarves  to  establish themselves as their nominal overlord, in return for protection against\nthe  ogres  and  the  ability  to trade with the holds. Jade High King Muiri I accepted all of\nthese  petitions,  and  within  a  few  decades  virtually  all of the human tribes in Northern\nRahen  were  under  the  direct  influence  of  the  Jade  Empire  by 2700 BA. Grôzumdihr\nespecially  developed  close  ties  with  the  Ghankheden  people  living in the hills near its\ngates, sharing technology, philosophy, and administrative methods with them.\n\n== Fall of the Jade Empire ==\n\n=== The Goblintide ===\nUnder the command of Grimka the Despoiler, a powerful goblin wizard, the goblins of the\nTree  of  Stone  united  in 2497 BA, and began large-scale assaults on all transport between\nthe  holds.  While  none  of  the  holds were attacked head-on, they were all de facto under\nsiege,  as  they  could  barely  reach  any of the other holds. As it became apparent that the\nTree  of  Stone  holds  were  unable  to regain control over the Dwarovrod by themselves, a\nmassive  army  led  by  general  Dourban  Brightbrow  was  rallied in Grônstunad to regain\ncontrol over the Tree of Stone in 2474 BA.\n\nAs  the jade army entered the Tree of Stone, Grimka sent emissaries to the hobgoblin clans\nin  the Jade Mines and on the surface, proposing a united front against the dwarves in 2472\nBA. In return, they promised the Hobgoblins would receive Grônstunad, the grandest hold\nof the east, as their prize.\n\nThe  Jade  army  successfully  destroyed  several  goblin  encampments  in  the  vicinity  of\nHul-az-Krakazol  in  2471  BA,  enabling  the  hold to be supplied through the Dwarovrod\nfrom  the  Jade  Mines  again.  King  Grongnir  I  of  Hul-az-Krakazol  offered  troops and\nsupplies  to  the  army  as  they  prepared  to  move further into the Tree of Stone. In turn,\nGrimka  ordered  a  full  siege  of  Ovdal-az-Ân  in  order  to delay the dwarves as much as\npossible, and sent word to the hobgoblin and goblin tribes of the jade mines."

The alarm was raised, and messages were sent to the other\nholds in the Jade mines and to the expeditionary force in the Tree of Stone.\n\nWith the attack from the south commencing, the goblins and hobgoblins of the Jade Mines\nalso  initiated  their  attacks,  and  shut off the access routes from the east and west towards\nGrônstunad  in  2469  BA. The Jade Mines were in virtually the same situation as the Tree\nof Stone now, with all access between holds nearly impossible.\n\n=== Relief of Ovdal-az-Ân ===\nThe  jade army broke the siege of Ovdal-az-Ân, routing the goblin forces in 2468 BA, with\nthe  jade  army requesting supplies and access past the hold in order to relieve Grôzumdihr\nas  well,  but  king  Snorri  V  refused.  He  was  insulted by the Jade armies, as he had not\nrequested  them,  and  their  presence  implied  they  were  unable  to  deal  with  a simple\ninfestation  of  goblins around their hold. After nearly two months of attempting diplomacy\nwith  Snorri, the jade army returned to Hul-az-Krakazol. Unsure what to do next, they sent\nword back to Grônstunad asking for instructions.\n\n=== Failed Relief of the Jade Mines ===\nA  messenger  returned from Tuwad-Dhûmankon over the surface, informing the jade army\nof  the  dire situation in the Jade Mines. Dourban Brightbrow ordered his forces to prepare\nfor   a  surface  journey  towards  Grônstunad,  however,  when  king  Grongnir  of  Hul-az\nKrakazol  heard  this,  he laughed in his face and called it the cowardly route. Wounded in\nhis  pride,  Dourban  ordered  his  troops  to instead move through the Dwarovrod in 2466\nBA.  As  they  attempted  to  move  through  the  tunnel towards the Jade Mines, they were\nambushed  by a large force of goblins and hobgoblins, in what eventually turned into a long\nsiege as the jade army dug itself into a defensive position in the tunnel."

Hearing of this, Grimka believed this to be the\nmoment  to  strike,  and ordered all the clans to go on the offensive again, launching direct\nattacks on the holds of the Tree of Stone yet again.\n\n=== The Goblintide Shattered ===\nWhile  leading  a  direct  assault  on  Grôzumdihr,  Grimka the Despoiler was killed as he\nattempted  to  break  a  powerful  runic  warding spell defending an outer gate in 2460 BA.\nThe  energy  released  as  the  spell  was broken disintegrated Grimka as well as any goblin\nwithin  his  vicinity.  Almost  immediately, the clans taking part in the siege started to fight\namongst  themselves  over  leadership  of  the  goblintide.  As  news  spread, the goblintide\ndisintegrated  as the many clans fell back into their old rivalries. The hobgoblins, however,\nremained united in their attacks against the Jade Empire.\n\n=== Granite Independence and Betrayal ===\nWith  the  Tunad  towards  the Jade Mines thoroughly under the control of the hobgoblins,\nthe  holds  of  the  Tree of Stone focused mostly on reclaiming control over the Dwarovrod\napart  from the area around Ovdal Kanzad. King Snorri V of Ovdal-az-Ân decreed that the\nJade  Empire no longer held sway over the Tree of Stone, and declared itself independent in\n2449 BA.\n\nGrôzumdihr  and  Hul-az-Krakazol  however  started organising a large expedition over the\nsurface  to relieve Grônstunad in 2445 BA. They intended to attack the surface settlements\nof  the Hobgoblins, in order to cut off supplies from the besieging forces. As they were sent\nout,  however,  Snorri accused them of plotting to put them back under the heel of the Jade\nEmpire.  As  the  Amethyst-Peridot  expedition was fighting the hobgoblins in northeastern\nRahen,  Snorri  arrived  at  the  gates  of Hul-az-Krakazol with an army, and began a siege.\nEnraged by the betrayal, the Amethyst-Peridot expedition returned to Hul-az-Krakazol, and\nattacked  the  besieging  forces.  In  a bloody battle in 2443 BA, the Granite Dwarves were\ndefeated,  and Snorri V was killed. His body, on the orders of the furious queen Ogdis I of\nHul-az-Krakazol,  was  thrown  into  a pit, and an extension of the Hul-az-Krakazol sewers\nwould  eventually  be  built  to  direct  the waste of the Amethyst Dwarves into what would\nbecome known as Snorri’s Dung Pit."

The\nthree  holds together managed to soundly beat the hobgoblins on the surface in open battle,\nand  attempt  to  move  towards  Grônstunad.  However,  the  cave entrance has since been\nfortified by the hobgoblins, and their advance was halted once again.\n\n=== The Fall of Grônstunad ===\nHaving   recovered   from   the   battle   of  Hul-az-Krakazol,  a  second  Amethyst-Peridot\nexpedition  was  organised  in  2438  BA and sent overland to attack the hobgoblins. As the\nhobgoblins  were  prepared  this  time,  they  were  less  successful,  and  while  they  made\nprogress,   it  was  slow.  With  Grônstunad  besieged  by  the  Hobgoblins,  the  defenders\nlaunched  an attack to their south which was successful, finally meeting up with the army of\nthe  Amethyst-Peridot  expedition  and  the  Nephrite  Expedition  led  by queen Ogdis I of\nHul-az-Krakazol.\n\nAt   the   same  time,  however,  the  western  and  eastern  gates  were  breached,  and  the\nhobgoblins  and  goblins  entered  Grônstunad  from  both  sides.

The battle took several\nmonths,  as  the  dwarves  desperately  attempted  to  hold  on  to  their capital. High King\nMoilin  IV  of  the  Jade  Empire and most of his direct family were killed in this battle, as\nwas  queen Ogdis I of Hul-az-Krakazol.

This\nact,  an  open  declaration of defiance to the Raja in Dhenijansar, brought about emissaries\narriving demanding an explanation and led to Jagaddipendra marching on the capital.\n\n== War of the Wilting Lotus ==\nArriving   at   Dhenijansar  with  2000  men  in  tow  and  his  ebony  bow  Tisarha  Dola,\nJagaddipendra  was  demanded  by  the  captain  of  the  guard  to  surrender  his weapons.\nFirst-hand  accounts report Jagaddipendra answering with one arrow to the captain's throat,\nthen  proceeding  to  calmly  evade  a  volley  of  defender  arrows.  Using  these very same\narrows,  he  returned them to the eyes or throats of the guards. It is said within minutes the\nwalls  were  silent  save  for the choking of dying men. With the defenders dead, the forces\nseized the city and slew the Raja.\n\nWhen  news  of  this  display  spread,  it shocked the feuding warlords of Rahen and forced\nthem  to  an armistice until Jagaddipendra could be slain and his forces dissipated. Various\nbattles were fought, such as at Ghun Fen, many which served only to attract more followers\nto  Jagaddipendra's  cause  as  he came to be seen as an unstoppable force. In time though,\nthe  forces  of  the  coalition  overwhelmed Jagaddipendra's own and he was slain. His bow\nrecovered  by  a  young warrior who was given lordship over Saddathar. There it is said the\nbow  remains  as  a  trophy  and  reminder. With his death came the dissolution of the first\nHarimraj that had assumed control over, and Rahen fell into an era of warlords fighting for\ncontrol."

He is regarded as the greatest\nruler  the  Havoric  kingdom  has seen, despite being otherwise a controversial figure. How\nJahanon  died  is  still unknown, since he disappeared on an expedition to seek immortality\nin an ancient city in Dolindha and was never seen again.\n\n== Early Life ==\n\n=== Life as a Mercenary ===\nThere  are  many  conflicting  claims  about  Jahanon's  early life, but it is theorized he was\nborn  to  a  lowborn  family in rural New Havoral. He would eventually join a low ranking\nmercenary  company  in  his  early  adult  years  and  take  over  its leadership by unknown\nmeans.\n\nThe  involvement  of  Jahanon's  company  in New Havoric campaigns are the first reliable\nrecords  of  him.  They  paint  him  as showing tactical competence but don't consider him\nnoteworthy, and he was unable to rise in renown due to his outsider status.\n\n=== Imprisonment in Arvezl ===\nIn  1752,  he  was captured in a New Havoric skirmish against Ynnic troops and taken as a\npolitical  hostage  in  the Arvezl keep, staying imprisoned for a year due to his superiors not\nconsidering  him  a  priority  during  negociations  for  release  of prisoners. His stay in the\nSarda  lands  was  however  not  unfruitful,  as Jahanon would be exposed to the wealth and\nsophistication of the Sarda royal court, quickly becoming fluent in the language.\n\nA  New  Havoric  diplomat  mentioned  after meeting him during unsuccesful negociations\nthat  Jahanon  fustigated  the lack of ambition of his fellow New Havorics, claiming that he\nwould  one  day  rule such a castle - a claim that was interpreted at the time to be a joke on\nhis situation."

The  escape path of the trio included the personal quarters of an Ynnic noble, with\na  magical  trident  exposed on the wall. The properties of the weapon were clearly noticed\nby  the  escapees, as Jahanon escaped with it - alone, his two friends in misfortune left dead\non the floor.\n\n=== Rise to Power ===\nJahanon  immediately  decided  to  reconnect  with  his  old  mercenary  company after his\nescape,  only to discover they assumed him dead and disbanded the company, moving on to\ndifferent  groups. He managed to track down the most loyal of his companions and devised\na  plan:  his  former  soldiers  would sow discontent within their new mercenary companies\nand  bandit  groups,  paving  the  way  for  Jahanon  to  step  in  and  take  them over. This\nhappened in many such groups, getting him in indirect control of larger and larger ones.\n\nEven after amassing such a large amount of soldiers, Jahanon was still aware that many had\ntried  to march on Greyguard, the capital of New Havoral, but that none so far managed to\nhold  power  for  the  rest  of  their  lives.  He  knew his victory would have to be total and\nunprecented. He thus opted for subterfuge, creating the "Nameless Host"; an army without\nany  official  leader, whose members and size were unknown, and with nebulous objectives.\nJahanon's  deception  was  even  used  at  his  own host, which he would spread conflicting\ninformation  to,  on both their intentions and size, in order for them to never know the true\nextent of their power.\n\nThe New Havoric leaders were used to seeing their power challenged regularly, but openly.\nSome of them were aware of the potential threat, but weren't aware of its full potential.\n\n=== Nameless no more ===\nThe  Nameless  Host  became  a boogeyman among bandit leaders as they became aware of\nits  existence,  spreading  paranoia  among  their  ranks  and  causing  them  to  waste their\nresources  hunting  rumors;  it was as they were spread thin trying to root the Host out that\nJahanon decided to strike. Small inconspicuous groups of bandits converged on Greyguard,\nand a mighty army formed out of nowhere at the gates of the capital."

As the Nameless Host saw\nvictory,  they  stormed  the  castle  and  reached the throne room. There, Jahanon stood up\nbeside  the  Marauder  King  with  the other throne guards and slaughtered each one. With\ntrident  in hand, he killed the Marauder King and threated the bandit leaders with a simple\ndemand:  he,  Jahanon  síl  Lethir,  is  the  Marauder  King,  and that they may be his loyal\nsubordinates,  or  die  in  the  same  room as the previous king. It took one bandit to kneel\nbefore  the  rest followed, with Jahanon picking up the crown from the dead king, crowning\nhimself in front of his new vassals.\n\n==Conqueror of the Ynn==\nIn  1788,  after  the  events  of  the  Red  Year,  Jahanon  declared war on the overextended\nCorinsfield  in  a  display  of  opportunism, and with a swift victory tripled New Havoral in\nsize  by  annexing  the entire Corinite while also integrating West Tipney as an autonomous\nregion.  Jahanon  would  be  able  to  finally act of his dreams of grandeur in the next year,\npersonally  leading  his  troops  in  battle against the Empire of Arverynn. Not only was his\ntactical  skill  on  the  battlefield  more than a match for the Ynnic armies, his cunningness\nallowed   New   Havorics  to  inflitrate  the  Ynnic  capital  and  capture  the  entire  Sarda\nleadership in one fell swoop, putting a quick end to the war.\n\nThis  event  sparked  the  Decades of the Mountain, a period of time where New Havoral’s\npower  was  at  its  peak.  The  Decades  are heavily associated with Jahanon himself, as he\nbecame  the  most  powerful cannorian ruler in the history of Aelantir. During that period,\nhe  renounced  the  title  of  Marauder  King  for  that of High Ruler, wanting to be seen as\nmore than a ruthless conqueror. It is debated whether his decision to move his court to the\ncastle  of Arvezl was out of a pragmatic desire to move closer to his new center of power or\nfor sentimental reasons.\n"

Constant fighting for survival, both against\nthe  hated  trolls  and  the  harsh,  near arctic environment forged a strong people who have\nlearned  to  take  what  riches they can from their land... and their enemies. Starting at the\nend of the 15th century, brave (or reckless) Gerudians seeking wealth from furs and hidden\ntreasure  in  the  frontier  would  set  forth  from  Algrar. When gold was discovered in the\nGullmork,  roughly  half  of  it  was  transported  through Sidaett and down the Rafn river,\nincreasing Sidaett's wealth and importance.\n\n==Economy==\nSidaett's  Silfrhof  market  was  known  as  a  quality  source  of  Gerudian  furs and amber\njewelry.\n\nIn  the  early  15th  century,  a  famous Revrhavn raider, long retired, passed away intestate\nwhile  in Sidaett lands.

It\nquickly became the premier bank in Gerudia and was a great boon to Sidaett's economy.\n\nEven  in  a land as wild and harsh as Gerudia, taxes must be collected for the Jarl. The Tax\nSheriffs  were  created  to  travel  throughout  Sidaett, collecting payment in any form; from\ncurrency  to  jewels  to crops. In the late 15th century, the King of Bjarnrík legitimized the\nTax Sheriffs as official collectors for his kingdom.\n\n==Architecture==\nThe  Rav  District  of  Silfrhof is home to the finest examples of Gerudian architecture and\ndesign;   public  gardens,  squares,  and  buildings  decorated  with  exquisite  carvings  are\nabundant.

First, the\n"Soul-Stripping".  For  this,  a  group of Jiangshi will quickly strip the chi out of a subject,\ntrapping  it  for  use later in the ritual. As a result of this, the subject will die. The Jiangshi\nwill  then  ensure  that  no  trace  of  chi  is  left  in the subject's body before beginning the\n"Soul-Stitching"  process. Here the trapped chi is put back into the now-corpse along with\ninfusing  the  corpse  with  some  of  the  Jiangshis'  own  chi. When this is completed, the\nsubject will reawaken as a Jiangshi."

While  In  1444  it  was  a republic presided by\nKatouka  of  the  Undying  Flame,  he would later in his life style himself king, turning the\ncountry into a kingdom.\n==Early History==\nNot  much  is  known of the area prior to the establishment of Jiantsiang itself, though it is\nbelieved  the  land  was  populated by different groups of semi-nomadic Shuvüüsh tribes, as\nthe  only  records  that  exist  from  that  time  were  written  by  those in the neighbouring\nTianlou, from which we learn that the area wasn't seen as part of Yanshen at the time.\n\nThis  would  change  when,  around  the  end  of  the  first  century  AA, the area would be\nconquered  by  the  early  Harimari  Empire,  who  quickly  saw  to  settle  it with harimari\nwarriors  to  protect  from further shuvüüsh raids.

This\nwould  in  turn  lead  to  an  increase  in  autonomy  during  the  later years of the Empire,\nculminating in the refusal by the Lord-Commander to crush the rebellion of Tianlou in the\nyear  400, which would turn out to be the final nail in the coffin for Harimari hegemony in\nthe  east.

This effectively\nsplit  Jiantsiang's  territory  in  half,  and  being  unable  to  crush  the  rebellion, it caused\nJiantsiang's  hegemony  to  crumble, its southern territories becoming independent or being\nincorporated into nearby republics."

As a child, he was fascinated by the stories of the\nskalds  and  bards who visited his family's tavern and restaurant, and he knew from a young\nage  that  he  wanted to become one himself. He began to study the stories and songs of the\nskalds and bards, as well as learning to play the horn and other instruments.

Adherents of the Kalun\nmasks believe that spirits that have existed since time immemorial and inhabit these masks,\nallowing  them  to  gain  control and aid the wearer. The Mayte also believe that the masks\ncan protect from the Silent Watchers which they believe can steal one's soul (and spirit).\n\n==Physical Appearance==\nThe  mask  itself  is  a tight-fitting mask that wraps itself across the entire head, leaving the\neyes  and  usually  the  nose and mouth exposed. The mask is colourful and decorated with\nsymbolism  that  evokes  the  personality and qualities of the ancestral spirit said to inhabit\nthe mask, for example, a spirit associated with fire may have a mask adorned with flames.\n\nTraditional  masks  are  made  of the skinned faces of the Silent Watchers (whose faces are\nconveniently pale, featureless and hairless making it a great base for decoration). This pairs\nwith  the  belief that the Silent Watchers are capable of capturing spirits, so slaying one and\ntaking its face equates itself to liberating a spirit.\n\nBy  the  19th  century  and  the  decline of the Silent Watcher population most masks were\nmade of other leather sources.\n\n==Role in Society==\n===Wearing of Masks===\nThe wearing of masks is mandatory, with the idea of being unmasked seen as a great shame\nand  dishonour. Being unmasked, to the Mayte culture, means being faceless and an outcast\nto  society.

It  is  Infamous  for its\nblue-colored  Kaydhano  sand,  which causes large, cancerous growths to appear on all who\ncome  into  contact  with  the  substance.  The  region  itself is uninhabited, say for the few\ndaring explorers that enter the wasteland in search of relics and damestear. The area is also\nthe  source  of  great  Kaydhano  sandstorms,  commonly  known  as  the  deathwinds,  that\nperiodically  blast  the nearby land of Alecand, heavily affecting the Kheionai and Eltibhari\npeople on the island.\n\n== Kaydhano Sand ==\nGiven  its  distinctive  blue  color,  scholars  for  a long time thought Kaydhano sand was at\nleast partially made of Damestear. Closer, hands-on experiments with the substance proved\nthat it contained very-little to no Damestear.\n\nRegardless,  it  is  magical  -  being a sought-after material with many uses, both lethal and\notherwise.  Due  to  the  lethality  of  the  material,  it  is  a  tricky substance to work with,\nrequiring adequate protection in order to not have one’s health be harmed.\n\nA  theorized  property  of  Kaydhano sand is its ability to turn a humanoid population’s skin\nblue  over  generations of low-level exposure. While only proven to have occurred with the\nKheionai elves, it is theoretically possible to happen to any humanoid group.\n\n=== Lethality of Kaydhano Sand ===\nThe  lethality  of  Kaydhano  sand  is  highly  dependent upon both the amount and time of\nexposure.  A  high  concentration of Kaydhano dust blown at an unprotected individual will\nalmost  certainly  kill,  earning the deathwinds their name. Meanwhile a small amount will\ncause  non  life-threatening  tumors  to appear on the skin, which will disappear over time.\nConversely,   working   closely   with   the  material  over  long  stretches  of  time  can  be\ndetrimental to one's health.\n\n=== Protection Suits ==="

Later Cannorian versions of the suits\nwere invented, although they paled in comparison to the Kheionai originals.\n\nThe  Chendhyan  peoples that live near the desert have their own natural protection against\nthe  Kaydhano  sand.  Their  semi-metallic  skin gives them enough protection to brave the\nwastes of the Kaydhano Sea for a time. This is unfortunately not complete protection, but it\nis noteworthy nonetheless.\n\n=== Uses of Kaydhano Sand ===\n\n==== Potídhano ====\nThe  Kheionai city-state of Arpedifér prided itself upon its glass-making capabilities. Using\nthe  large  amounts  of  Kaydhano  sand  that  deposit  outside  the  city’s  walls yearly, they\ndeveloped  a  special,  secret  process to remove the lethality of Kaydhano. While this does\nalso  remove  the  magical energy of the substance, it keeps its distinctive blue color. Using\nthis  sand,  the  Arpediféri  created the Potídhano glass, a beautiful, durable, and expensive\nblue-tinted glass produced exclusively in the city.\n\n==== As An Energy Source ====\nOne  of  the  more  novel  uses  of  Kaydhano  sand  is as an energy source. Kaydhano sand\nradiates  large  amounts  of  magical energy, which can be harnessed as power. This has not\nseen wide adoption due to its lethality, its most famous use being in Kheionai ships.\n\n==== As A Weapon ====\nKaydhano  sand  is  infamous for its lethality - this has not gone unnoticed by inventors and\nmilitaries.  There  have  been  designs  and  experimental  weapons  of  bombarding enemy\ndefensive positions with Kaydhano dust, and even Kaydhano dust-sprayers.

This occurred slightly before the Day of Ashen Skies,\nmeant to distract elven leadership from Ducaniel’s plans.\n\n=== Ashen Skies Malfunction ===\nAdvocates  of  this  theory  posit  that the magical shockwave and radiation caused the large\namount  of  weapons  stored in desert to malfunction on mass. This led to large explosions,\nrandom  magical effects, and other unpredictable events to take place, ultimately leading to\nthe  creation  of Kaydhano sand and the destruction of any and all life that once lived in the\narea.\n"

 page_events.801.d: "\nKelaktar  is  the word used to describe the fortified settlements around which Fathide Ogre\nsociety  is  organized.  Though  kelaktars  can  differ  greatly  in  size  and  shape,  they are\ncharacterized  by  an  encircling  wall  typically made of stone. So central are these types of\ncities to Fathide culture, that even nomadic ogres (such as the Wild Ogres of the Northern\nPass   or   pre-centaur   ogre   nomads   in  the  Forbidden  Plains)  would  move  between\nseasonally-vacant fortifications.\n\nIn  settled  ogre  society,  the  kelaktar  forms  the  most  basic  unit of administration. The\nconcept  of  a  farming  village  or  any  other  type of outlying hamlet is almost completely\nabsent  from  Fathide  society.  Ogre  husbandry  is  typically transhumance in nature, with\nanimal  herds  alternatively grazed out in the land surrounding a kelaktar, and brought back\nin  to  be  butchered  or  otherwise  processed.  Agriculture  is  very  similar; outside of the\nharvest  and  sowing  seasons, unneeded labor will typically move back to the kelaktar until\nthey  are  needed again. For these reasons, Fathide ogres have historically been some of the\nmost urbanized cultural groups on Halann.\n\nNaturally,  the  most important kelaktar within the Ogre Valley is that of Maghargma City,\nwhich  was  built  out of and around the cloud giant city that crashed into the Serpentspine.\nOlkhalebuhr   is   another   famed   kelaktar,  built  into  the  mountains  further  north  of\nMaghargma City, and is best known for being the source of some of the highest quality iron\nin  the  Forbidden  Plains;  alongside  imports  from Haless it constitutes a major source of\niron  for  the  Lake  Federation.  The kelaktar of Rijansvi is notable both for its position as\none  of the only kelaktars to ever have been owned by wild ogres, as well as its appearance,\nwith most of its walls covered in a bronze gilt.\n\nSome  scholars  will  attribute this behavior to a traditional need for the slow-moving ogres\nto properly defend themselves out on the steppes of the Forbidden Plains. However, the far\nmore  popular  theory  is that such an urban focus is a cultural quirk inherited by the ogres\nfrom their True Giant progenitors. The primary piece of evidence for this argument can be\nfound  in  the  Shirgrii  of  Haless. Though separated by the Serpentspine and thousands of\nyears without contact, the Horned Ogres have a similar practice of congregating in fortified\ntemple complexes, suggesting some ancient shared origin to the practice."

 page_events.805.d: "\n== Introduction ==\nThe  military  history of the Kheionai covers a vast timespan, from The Day of Ashen Skies\nup  to  the  present.  For  most  of  that  time  period,  innovation in warfare was static and\ninfantry-focused,  centered  upon  the  venerable  phalanx.  Only  with  the  introduction of\nhorses  through  the  invasion  of  Taychend  by  the  state  of Ameion in the mid 1400s did\nKheionai  warfare  finally,  but  slowly, evolve beyond the use of dense-infantry formations.\nAs the Kheionai adapted to using cavalry, first with chariots, and then with mass formations\nof  light  cavalry,  infantry formations were forced to cope with the very real threat of being\nsurrounded  and  destroyed  by  cavalry.  In response, Kheionai infantry formations became\nlooser,  with  anti-cavalry  tactics  adopted  en-masse. Even with cavalry now a factor, most\nKheionai armies kept to the phalanx.\n\nWith  the  coming  of  the  Cannorians and gunpowder, the armies of Alecand and Devand\nwere once again forced to evolve. Many kheions looked to Ameion’s armies for an example\nof  how  best to use gunpowder, while more conservative kheions that clung to the phalanx,\nopted  to instead magically enchant their equipment to withstand gunfire. As time marched\non,  however,  even the most conservative Kheionai armies adopted gunpowder technology,\nand  abandoned  the  phalanx formation. In comparison, the new class of mounted-soldiers\namong  the  Kheionai  came  to  embrace  the  gun  much  more quickly than their infantry\ncounterparts, and found great success with the use of caracole tactics.\n\nAs  the  old  ways  of  phalanx  warfare  faded  into  memory, a new generation of Kheionai\ncommanders  and  their  soldiers  came  to  embrace  the  gun  with increasing enthusiasm.\nKheionai  officers would be sent to Cannorian military academies, learning modern tactics,\nand   then   return  to  their  homelands  with  the  latest  tactical  innovations.  Cannorian\nmercenary  companies  would  find  themselves  hired  by  wealthy  kheions too, with many\nending up settling down upon the coasts of The Cleaved Sea.\n\nBy  the  18th  and  19th  centuries, Kheionai armies were on par with those of Cannor and\nHaless.  Using  the  latest  tactics and drills, they had long since lost any vestiges of the old\nways of war that their ancestors had practiced for a millennia."

The cities would devolve\ninto  brutal  infighting,  with  constant  civil  wars  and power struggles affecting every city.\nWhile little is known of the period, what is certain is that constant urban warfare occurred,\nwith  house  to  house  fighting  being  incredibly  common  during this time period. Many\nprominent  scholars have speculated that the Kheionai’s proclivity to close-ordered infantry\nwarfare  came  about  during  this  era.  If  so,  there is no verifiable evidence to back such\nclaims.\n\n=== Leaving The Wards ===\nWhen the ashes in the sky disappeared and the cities stabilized, they began to reach beyond\ntheir  wards,  building settlements and coming into contact with each other. While many of\nthese  interactions  were  peaceful  in  nature,  some were quite violent, with border clashes\nbeing  a  frequent  occurrence  among certain kheions. As there were no horses in Alecand,\nthe  armies  of  the  Kheionai during this time period were exclusively made up of infantry.\nDue  to  the  early  Kheionai’s  great knowledge of metalworking, infantry, even during this\nperiod,  would  be equipped with heavy armor, spears, and swords of either iron or bronze,\norganized  into  loose  bands.  As  the  period  progressed  and  border  wars  became more\nfrequent,  these  infantry  bands would become better organized and equipped. They fought\nin a defensive manner, with many battles during this time period being won by the side that\nlasted the longest."

The Kherkan\nLeague was composed of Kherka, Lokemeion, Kimánis and Arpedifér, while the Degabhen\nLeague  was  composed of Degakheion, Oktikheion and Ormam. These two leagues would\nenter  the  first  great  war of the Kheionai, with many large-scale battles being fought. It is\nduring  this  period  that  the  Phalanx  was  introduced  to  the  Kheionai  by the kheion of\nArpedifér.  While  at the beginning of the league war, only Arpedifér employed the phalanx\nformation, by the war’s end, every kheion had adopted the formation. Armies numbering in\nthe  tens  of  thousands  organized  themselves  in the phalanx, armed with bronze armor, a\nlong  spear,  and  a  bronze  shield.  Even after The Kherkan League’s victory in 360, every\nkheion continued to employ the formation in their armies.\n\nThe  phalanxes used during this period and afterwards would be called “Pure Phalanxes” by\nlater  historians  to  distinguish  these  formations  from  other  variants  developed  by  the\nKheionai.\n\n==== Pure Phalanx ====\n“The  phalanx’s  excellence  in  massed  infantry  warfare  in  Alecand  left  many city states\nignorant  to its many flaws against mobile military formations. As a result, military strategy\ndeveloped  to  optimize the phalanx’s strengths as an indomitable forward-facing formation.\nThe   Alecandi   Kheionai  would  concentrate  their  best  soldiers  in  a  dense  formation\nwithdrawn  from  the  battlefield,  while  sending  their regular hoplites to push forwards in\nstandard  phalanx  tactics. As the battle degenerated into an exhausting stalemate, Kheionai\ngenerals  would  concentrate  their  elite forces in a flanking maneuver, intending to shatter\nand rout their exhausted enemies. Historians who observed the exclusive use of the phalanx\nin  this  strategy by the Kheionai would refer to the formation as the Pure Phalanx.”Iosapos\nAisodokes, “A History of Kheionai Warfare”"

This prosperous period saw its soldiers\nequipped  with  better,  more high quality armor and weaponry, and a focus on professional\nsoldiers, in comparison to the large, conscript-based armies of The League War.\n\n=== Colonization Of The Mainland ===\nShortly  after mainland South Aelantir was discovered by an Oktikheioni voyage in 468, an\nexpedition  was mounted by Degakheion to investigate the new lands. What had begun as a\nsimple  reconnaissance  mission  soon  grew  to  become  a  full blown settlement, Eneion.\nSoon,  the  other kheions had founded new kheions, or Nékheis, upon the mainland. These\nsettlers  had to contend with the Basobhar, (literally forest barbarian) a large group of elves\nthat fought in a completely different manner from the Kheionai. While the kheions formed\nup  in large, unwieldy phalanxes, the Basobhar fought with skirmishing and ambush tactics.\nThe  Nékheis  were  forced  to  adapt  their  phalanxes to combat the Basobhar. These new\nformations produced what had come to be the first variant of the phalanx that the Kheionai\nhad developed, the “Guarded” Phalanx.\n\n==== Guarded Phalanx ====\n“The  phalanx  was  the  predominant  military  formation  used amongst the Kheionai city\nstates  for  centuries. However, the phalanx was also inherently inflexible and vulnerable to\nflanking  maneuvers;  this  was  a pressing problem for Kheionai polities as their Bharbhen\nadversaries could easily outmaneuver and encircle phalanxes using their mobile mounts. To\naddress   these   critical   flaws,   Kheionai   rulers,  especially  those  from  Empkeios  and\nLokemeion,  would  leverage the economic and political clout of their urban powerbases to\nconvince  rural  aristocrats  to muster skirmishers from their fiefs. Armed with javelins and\nthrusting  spears,  these  auxiliary  skirmishers  were  deployed  to  defend  and support the\nphalanx by blocking flanking enemies. “"

To  counter  the  Taychendi  elves’  cavalry,  Laskaris  would  maintain  reserve\nhoplites  to  either drive away these mounted soldiers throughout the battle or, more boldly,\nproactively   intercept   these   foes  and  drive  away  the  threat  of  cavalry  charges.These\naudacious  tactics,  combined  with  support  by  local mercenaries and ranged skirmishers,\nwould  enable  the  Ameioni  center  to  continuously  push  unabated  into the outmatched\nhordes  of  Taychendi  and claim many a battlefield in victory.”Nisos Iskrates, “The Armies\nof the Ameioni Empire”\n\nNisos Iskrates, “The Armies of the Ameioni Empire”\n\n=== The Eltikhan War ===\nWhen  the  Eltibhar  clans  united  into  the  kingdom  of  Eltikhan,  much of the Kheionai\nignored the threat. When Eltikhan began its invasion of Lokemeion, the kheion was caught\noff  guard.  As  the  war  dragged  on,  Lokemeion  was  forced  to innovate, creating a new\nvariant of the phalanx, the Lokemeioni Phalanx.\n\n==== Lokemeioni Phalanx ====\n“The  15th  century  was  unkind  to the people of Lokemeion, as Bharbhen raids escalated\ninto  full-scale  war  with  the  united  Eltikhan  kingdom.  Initial battles led to defeat after\ndefeat  as  the  traditional  auxiliary  skirmishers  that  guarded  the flanks proved unable to\nwithstand the Bharbhen horde and their wretched boar mounts. Thus the Lokemeioni were\nforced  to  adapt  to  the  shifting  tides  of  warfare.  Instead  of  relying  on  simple levies,\nLokemeion  began  to recruit sýnaranbhen, veteran soldiers defending the colonies near the\nEltikhan,  to hold the flanks of the battlefield.

Eventually, some of these horses would be sold to\nkheions  friendly  to  Ameion, including Eneion. The Eneioni, in turn, would quickly share\nthe  horses  with  Degakheion. As the first of the Kheionai to develop cavalry, the Ameioni\nwould  primarily  use  horses  for  chariots.  The  example  of  these chariot units would be\ncopied  by  other Kheionai states, and it would not be long before every kheion had a horse\nbreeding program and chariot units of their own.\n\n==== Ameioni War Chariots ====\n“For  much  of  their  history,  the  Kheionai  lacked  any  mounts,  leading  to a battlefield\ndominated  solely  by  infantry.

With his conquest came, amongst other things,\nthe  introduction  of  horses  to the Kheionai through the Ameioni.The steeds' potential for\nbattle  was quickly recognized by the Ameioni, but the general unfamiliarity with horseback\nriding  rendered  heavy  cavalry  a challenge to implement. Emulating the beasts-of-burden\nthat  worked the plows to till their fields, the Ameioni crafted war chariots for the horses to\ndrive   through   the   battlefield.   Although   these  chariots  proved  to  be  unwieldy  and\noccasionally  unpredictable  to  operate  for the drivers, their mobility on open fields could\ndecisively  overcome  the  virtuous,  powerful  phalanx.  Through a combination of archers\nsafely  weakening  the  formations  from  the safety of the chariots and the ravaging damage\nthat  chariots  could  cause  by  running down wavering hoplites after volleys of arrows, the\nchariots  proved  to  be  a  powerful tool to counter the phalanx.”Eratos Agenor, “Kheionai\nCavalry Warfare”\n\nEratos Agenor, “Kheionai Cavalry Warfare”\n"

The prime example of this is the Ameioni Fotistrépei.\n\nThe  second  school  of  thought  rejected gunpowder outright, instead seeking to magically\nenchant  their heavy armor en-masse to be resistant to bullets. The most infamous example\nof this would be the Arpediferi Phalanx.\n\n==== Ameioni Fotistrépei ====\n"Ameion's  expansion  into  Taychend  rapidly stagnated following the death of Laskaris the\nConqueror.  However,  the  legacy  of  momentous  military reform did not pass away with\nsuch   a   great   elf.   One   such   reform   was   the  Fotistrépei  system,  where  Ameioni\nadministrators  exchanged  land  and privileges to Kheionized Taychendi soldiers.Known as\nthe  Fotistrépei,  these  soldiers  would  form  a  permanent  and  loyal  native  force.  The\nFotistrépei  would  not  only help suppress Taychendi unrest under Ameioni occupation but\nalso  revitalize  further  conquest  of  Taychend  when  the  Sun  Elves  arrived  in Southern\nAelantir  and  shattered  Larankar's empire. Armed with both Cannorian muskets imported\nby  their  Kheionai  leadership  and indigenous weapons such as longbows and javelins, the\nFotistrépei  would  act  as  light  infantry  responsible  for providing firepower and probing\nattacks  in support of Ameioni phalanxes who would steadily push towards the main enemy\nforce.  This,  combined  with ample heavy cavalry support, were decisive against Taychendi\narmies  who  could  not  adapt  against Ameion's dynamic and overwhelming tactics on the\nbattlefield."\n\nNisos Iskrates, “The Armies of the Ameioni Empire”\n\n==== Arpediféri Phalanx ===="

The\ntraditional  way  of  war  of the Kheionai was brought to kneel by the musket, whose bullets\ncould  penetrate  the  shields  and  armor  of the mighty hoplite and shatter the morale and\ndiscipline  of the phalanx formation in battle. Yet, despite their lethality, firearms could not\nshake  the  hardened  hearts  of  the  Arpediféri,  the venerable pioneers of the phalanx. To\navoid   dishonoring   their   kheion's  most  sacred  institution,  the  Arpediféri  would  pay\nexorbitant  expenses  for  the  finest  and strongest armor and equipment to save themselves\nfrom  bullets,  even  going  as  far  as  consulting  mages  to  render their shields seemingly\ninvulnerable  by  enchanting them with the same abjurations that have shielded their people\nfrom  the  kaydhano for millenia. Though some would still fall despite their warded armor,\nothers   truly   became   invulnerable  on  the  battlefield,  forming  the  vital  core  for  the\nArpediféri army in the early-modern era.”\n\nIosapos Aisodokes, “A History of Kheionai Warfare”\n\n=== Pistolier Cavalry ===\nThe  new  class  of  cavalry  soldiers took to the gun much more quickly than their infantry\ncounterparts.  They  saw  the  potential  of  the  new  weapons,  with  many  a  horse  rider\nequipping  themselves  with  multiple  pistols.  Adopting  the  caracole tactic from Cannor,\nthese  new  cavalry  units let go of their heavy armor in favor of speed and maneuverability,\nharassing  enemy  infantry formations. The Oktikheioni Outriders were the best at this new\nform  of  cavalry,  and  became  the  standard  by which other Kheionai cavalry units would\ncopy.\n\n==== Oktikheioni Outriders ====\n“When  firearms  were  introduced  to  the  Kheionai,  the  emerging  class  of professional\ncavalry  welcomed  them  with  open  arms just as they did with equestrianism decades ago,\nespecially   those   of   the  Okitkheioni  people.  Equipping  themselves  with  pistols  and\nforegoing  most  of  their  heavy  full-body  armor to allow greater speed on the battlefield,\nthese  equestrians  transitioned  from  heavy cavalry into equally-as-dangerous skirmishers.\nThe  Oktikheioni  Outriders  were  renowned  for  their  ability to isolate phalanxes before\norbiting  their  unfortunate  enemies  in  a  ring  of  death,  firing as many pistols into them\nbefore  tactically  retreating  into  friendly  forces  to  reload  and repeat the process. These\nskirmisher  cavalry  forced  the  Alecandi  Kheionai  to  either  relinquish  their traditional\nphalanx, or be outpaced, outgunned and outmaneuvered on the battlefield.""

Soon after, the musket proliferated throughout\nthe  kheion, and its generals openly integrated them into the Besolakí army, reforming their\nstrategies  around  such  powerful  weapons.The Besolakí Square was a product of the mass\nintroduction  of  firearms  into  the  army,  which  was  a  hollowed formation which could\nprotect  arquebusiers  as they shot at Bharbhen and rival Kheionai invaders under the safety\nof  disciplined  hoplites armed with sarissa and shields.

The Alecandi opted to use heavily armored\ncavalry,  whose  armor  had  been  enchanted  to withstand bullets.Meanwhile, the nekheis,\nwhose  environment was too rough and hostile to allow for heavily armored cavalry, instead\nfocused  upon masses of lightly-armored horse riding skirmishers. The difference would be\nmost clearly seen in the examples of the Ormami Cuirassiers and the Devandi Rangers.\n\n==== Ormami Cuirassiers ====\n"Despite  the  rapid  proliferation  of  cavalry  throughout  Kheionai, Ormam maintained a\nrelatively  limited cavalry force compared to their neighbors, favoring expenditures towards\na modernized infantry-centric force. As a result, professional cavalry became a rarity on the\nbattlefield,  only consisting of the military elite and upper-class citizen-soldiers. To protect\nthemselves   from   the   evermore   deadly   battlefield,   these  cavalry-elves  would  equip\nthemselves  with  heavy  curaisses  and  even  armor  their  expensive horses with abjurated\nbarding. Though the average Ormami cuirassier was slower than their contemporaries, they\nwere  relentless and invulnerable the moment they began their devastating shock charges on\nthe  battlefield,  particularly  when  Ormami  infantry  had  closed  the distance and pinned\nenemy infantry with Delisian warfare tactics."\n\nEratos Agenor, “Kheionai Cavalry Warfare”\n\n==== Devandi Rangers ====\n"The  Devandi  Kheionai  were  one  of the greatest at utilizing cavalry in rough conditions\nand  geography.  However,  the  cavalry  charge  could  not  penetrate the dense and mighty\nforests   and   as   a   result,   cavalry   predominantly   was   limited   to   skirmishing  and\nreconnaissance  roles.  As  gunpowder  warfare  and cavalry doctrine rapidly evolved as the\nKheionai  were  entrenched  in  deeper conflict against their neighbors and the Cannorians,\nmany  of the Devandi Kheionai states adopted mobile carabiniers to defend their roads and\ncoastlines  where  their  dense  woods  couldn't  obstruct  enemy  armies.

Those that could\nnot  afford  to  arm  most  of  their  soldiers  with  firearms  instead  sought to loosen their\nformations,   following   the   model  of  Kylakas  Doukas  of  Empkeios  and  his  Doukas\nFormation.\n\n==== Kherkan Grenadiers ====\n"Kherka,   a   state   made   up   of  exceptional  metalworkers,  became  a  center  of  gun\nmanufacturing  in  South  Aelantir  as  firearms  became  more commonplace in warfare. It\nbecame  no  surprise  that  the Kherkans were the first of the Kheionai to arm a majority of\nits  soldiers  with  flintlock  muskets. By the mid-1630s, there was one musketeer for every\npike-elf  remaining  in  service.  The  forward vanguard of the new Kherkan army were the\nKherkan  Grenadiers,  who  would  fight as skirmishers using long-barreled muskets.These\nGrenadiers  would  be  infamous for throwing salvos of ceramic grenades to provide deadly\ncover  before  retreating  from  advancing  enemy  formations.

Inspired  by Cannorian military advisors and his own experience as a\nmercenary in Cannorian armies, Doukas concluded that modern Kheionai formations were\ntoo  slow, unwieldy and reactive to fight modern battles against the Bharben, and needed to\nbe  simplified  while  avoiding losing firepower.In response Doukas ordered that battalions\nof  soldiers  would  be  divided  into smaller and narrower companies to allow for superior\nmovement  and  more  troops  to  be  active  on  the  battlefield;  these  soldiers  would  be\nequipped  with  flintlock  muskets and be issued long plug-bayonets in order to serve a dual\nrole  as musketeer and pikeman.

Every   soldier   was  equipped  with  a  firearm,  and  were  trained  in\nCannorian-style tactics. It was at this point that the final vestiges of the old ways of phalanx\nwarfare  were  left  behind,  as  Kheionai  generals sought to look to Cannorian armies and\ntheir mercenaries for how best to adapt to the changing face of modern warfare.\n\n==== Delisian Line ====\n"When  the  city of Ormam was submerged into decades of warfare from rival kheions and\nCannorian  expeditionaries  in  between  the  17th  and  18th  century, it became clear that\nmilitary reform was a necessity for self-preservation. Kylakas Delis, who governed Ormam\nduring   the   mid-1600s,   would   take  advantage  of  the  kheion's  extensive  mercantile\nconnections  to  import thousands of flintlock muskets from friendly kheions to fully equip\nhis  soldiers  with  firearms.  These  soldiers  would  be  assembled  into  lines  of  infantry\ncompanies,  tasked in closing the distance with the support of skirmishers in order to fire a\nmass  volley  of  musketry  before  charging the weakened enemy with bayonets.

Those  at  the front would be\nequipped  with  costly  abjurated  armor, similar to what the Arpediféri had pioneered, and\nfire  upon  the  opposing  line.  Meanwhile,  infantry  without  this  armor  would focus on\nreloading   muskets   behind   safe   cover   to   provide   the   front-rank   soldiers.

While many Alecandi states continued to\nemploy  line  formations, those in Devand reformed their armies to open order formations.\nThe  brother-kheions  of  Eneion  and Deyeion were great examples of this, as they quickly\nditched line formations as soon as their commanders started falling to sharpshooters on the\nbattlefield.\n\n==== Eneioni Skirmishers ====\n"It has been said by the Kheionai that an Eneioni elf could be blindfolded and still identify\nevery  tree,  rock,  and  stream  in  their  countryside  as if nothing had been blocking their\nvision.

When the Eneioni\nmilitary  leadership  noticed  the  increasing  effectiveness  of  open-order formations upon\nforeign  battlefields,  they  collectively  agreed  with  little  debate  to  begin  reforming the\nEneioni  army  away  from  the  old  ways  of  closed-order  formations  that  the rest of the\nKheionai desperately held on to.The new Eneioni army birthed from these reforms became\none of the greatest of its generation in South Aelantir.

Going  into  the  late  18th  century,  the cavalry of the Amgremósi rode on\nspecially-bred   horses  which  were  faster  and  more  athletic  than  their  other  Devandi\ncounterparts, using their speed to outpace the enemy and easily weave into the flanks of the\nbattlefield;  armed  with  carbines,  the  Amgremósi were capable of accurately firing while\nmoving  and  just  as  competent  at  reloading  on  horseback.

 page_events.806.d: "\nKheionism  is the predominant philosophical and ideological tradition among the Kheionai\npeoples.  The philosophy is uniquely atheist in its teachings, as the Kheionai do not believe\nin  the  existence  of  any deities whatsoever. Instead, the Kheionai place their faith in their\nelected  leaders  to  lead  them  into  the future. The ideology spread with the expansion of\nKheionai  states  during  the  15th  and  16th  centuries.  Most  notable  among  these  was\nAmeion,  who's  “Kheionization”  policies  in  Taychend  gave  rise  to a seperate Taychendi\ntradition of Kheionist beliefs.\n\n== Core Concepts ==\n\n=== The Place Of The City ===\nKheionism  as an ideology focuses heavily on the role of the city state. In the world view of\nKheionism,  the  city  state  is  the  ultimate  form of civilization. It is no surprise then that\nKheionist societies are heavily urbanized, with the urban classes holding great influence.\n\n=== The Republican Ideal ===\nKheionist  followers  are  extremely intolerant of monarchs, characterizing them as nothing\nmore  than  mere  despots,  who  rule through force alone. Kheionist societies highly value\nrepublican  institutions,  and  see monarchies as backwards and barbaric. Republics are the\nhallmark of a civilized society, and if a people wish to become civilized, they must organize\nthemselves into a republic.\n\n=== The Role Of The State ===\nThe  state  plays  a  key  role  in  Kheionism. Its duty is to guide its citizens into the future,\nprotecting  them  from  any  and  all  dangers.  Many governmental philosophies existed in\nKheionism,   but   the   3   most  prominent  were  the  Maederitic  Rule,  the  Dictats  Of\nIskaropaeus,  and  the  Axierophonic  Mandate. Kheionist states followed the governmental\nphilosophy of its head of state. Traditionally, the next head of state would follow a different\ngovernment  philosophy  than their predecessor, and 2 heads of state in a row following the\nsame philosophy was quite an uncommon occurrence in Kheionist states."

 page_events.2329.d: "\n\n==== Maederitic Rule ====\nMaederites  of Kimanis is best known for his great treatise on government, 'Tides', a series\nof  dialogues  on  the  ebb  and  flow of the fortunes of elves and their kheions. Maederites\nargued  that every government has strengths and weaknesses that expose themselves in times\nof  acute stress. Of the many forms of government, those that fail to adapt always fail, while\nthose  that  can  grow  will  minimize  stressors on their society and hold the best chance to\nthrive. As such, Maederitic governmental policy seeks to prevent the entrenchment of static\nforces  that  will  stop  a  state  from evolving as needed, and emphasizes the importance of\ndestroying  special  interest  groups that will steer a government away from being able to act\ndecisively and responsively to its people.\n\n==== Dictats Of Iskaropaeus ====\nIsparokaeus  of  Empkheios  believed that reality was tethered not to physical things, but to\nthe  perception  of  those  things  within  the  minds  of  each  elf.  As  such  it  was not the\nmeasurable  strength  of a kheion that mattered, but the perception of said kheion’s strength\nand  prestige, for if all believe a kheion to be honorable, mighty, and just, then such a thing\nbecomes  true.  Isparokeaen  philosophy  thus  stressed  the  need  to  constantly cultivate a\npotent  reputation  internally  and  externally,  securing the kheion with aggrandizing words\ncarried on swift ships and silver tongues.\n\n==== Axierophonic Mandate ====\nAxierophon  of Lokemeion’s teachings note that the foremost role of a Kheion’s government\nis  to  serve  the people, and that a people are best served by being made secure. Security is\nnecessary  for  a  people’s  rights  to  be  guaranteed,  and security from threats internal and\nexternal can only be maintained with a strong military and a monopoly on force that can be\ndeployed to crush internal rebellion and dissuade foreign enemies from attacks. Sometimes\nderided  as  a philosophy of “might makes right”, Axierophonic governmental policy places\nmilitary  affairs  at  the  front and center of the kheion’s decision making in order to protect\nits people."

The Kheionai do not even have a word\nfor “god” in their language, and lack such a concept entirely. It is common for a Kheionist,\nwhen  faced  with  the  preachings  of  the follower of a god, to simply ask “prove that god’s\nexistence”.  As  foreign  religions  often  fail  to  meet  the  threshold  of proof required for\nKheionists to be convinced, it often leads to much frustration, for Kheionists simply do not\nunderstand  the  concept  of  worshiping  beings  that  do not manifest themselves upon this\nplane.

 page_events.811.t: "Khetism 1 / 4"
 page_events.811.d: "\nKhetism  is  the  primary  religion of the people of Kheterata. Its founding goes far back to\nancient  times,  when  the  Elikhet led the Kheteratan people from Bulwar into the Salahad\nDesert.  The  basis  of the religion is the worship of Elikhet and his descendants, known as\nthe  Khet,  a  race of god-like beings resembling a human with a cat head. The existence of\nother  gods is neither expressly recognized nor denied, but the worship of any entity beyond\nthe  Khet  is  strictly rejected. The faith primarily exists along the Mother's Sorrow, as well\nas much of the Kheteratan coast and Khetapera, though foreign enclaves are known to exist\nas well.\n\n==Structure==\nThe Khetist faith is structured around the Khet family, with the quasi-divine Khet acting as\nall  religious  authority  while  the  human  Kheteratans  act as worshipers and priests. The\nmain  figure  in the faith is the Khetarch, a member of the Khet family elected by a council\nof  elders  within  the  family,  known  as  the  Elder  Council. Under official doctrine, the\nKhetist  faith  places  Elikhet  as  the  eternal  master of Kheterata and - while not rejecting\nother  gods'  existence - the only being worthy of true worship by the Kheteratans; the Khet\nfamily as just below him, worshiped his holy descendants yet positioned as demigods rather\nthan  full divinities; and below them the (traditionally human) High Priest of Elikhet, their\nrepresentative on religious affairs, and the appointed King of Kheterata, known to the Khet\nas the Steward of the Sorrow, their representative on secular affairs. In theory, both of these\npositions  exist  solely on the sufferance of the current Khetarch, though in reality the King\ncan  exert significantly more independence than the High Priest can - though even the King\ncan be, and has been, replaced by the Khetarch.\n\n==Doctrine==\nThough  Khetism  at  its  core is a simple belief in the sanctity of Elikhet and his kin above\nother  gods,  there also exists a complex canon of official doctrines and unofficial traditions\nrooted  in  records  of  Elikhet's  personal  decrees  as  well  as  later  proclamations of the\nKhetarchs.\n"
 page_events.2335.t: "Khetism 2 / 4"
 page_events.2335.d: "\nOne  of  the  most well-documented of Elikhet's decrees, issued in response to questions of\nthe nature of the djinn, was on the sanctity of magic.\n\nIt is the nature of men to shape the world with their hands. It is the nature of gods to shape\nthe  world  with  but  their  will.  The  force  you would call magic is the application of the\ndivine  will,  and  in  its  pure  state a sign of the highest holiness, yet in these devils called\ndjinn  it  has been corrupted. Stolen from the heavens, the magics of these djinn are putrid!\nLook  upon  our  former  kin to the east, the Bulwari, ruled now by men turned devils after\nthey,  tricked  by  the  most perfidious of all djinn Brasan the Liar, sought to turn the djinn\nmagics  to  their  advantage  and were driven mad, falsely proclaiming themselves gods. Let\nthose  who were justly granted the gift of magic from birth be regarded as holy, yet all those\nwho would steal this gift must be regarded as the worst of sinners.\n\nThe  original  interpretation  of  this  saw the mages of Kheterata given great privileges and\npolitical  positions,  existing  as  one  of  the  highest  ranks  of  the  traditional Kheteratan\nnobility.  This  would  eventually  cause  issues  with  Khetist  authorities, with the magical\nnobility  being  some  of  the  most enthusiastic adopters of Damerian culture following the\nRepublic's  conquest  of  Kheterata  and  many  placing  the  Dame  as  equal to Elikhet in\nauthority.\n\nElikhet's  return  on  the  Day  of  Ashen Skies would see this tendency wiped out, with the\nKheteratan  nobility finding itself abolished as a legal class in favor of an empowered clergy\nthat swiftly propagated a new doctrine calling on those of magical potential to serve Elikhet\nhimself  in his priesthood rather than pursuing selfish ambitions as their noble predecessors\nhad.  The Tower of Muhaqaar was erected near the clergy's traditional center of power, the\ncity of Nirakhet, as both educational and research facility for Kheterata's mages\n\n===Khetarch===\nThe  Khetarch  is the main authority within the faith, and has many powers because of this.\nThe Khetarch's primary duty is assigning a king to Kheterata, though in times of peace they\nusually  bestow  the  title  to  the  king's  chosen heir, normally the firstborn child, making\nKheterata  function  like  a  traditional  monarchy in most cases. The Khetarch also assigns\nmembers  to  the Elder Council when old members pass away. Usually the Khetarch fulfills\nthe  minimum required in their position such as ceremonial and religious activities, though\nit  is  not  too  uncommon  for  the  Khetarch  to  select  another  Khet, or, in rare cases, a\nKheteratan,  to perform these duties in their stead. While the Khetarch can extend absolute\nauthority  over  Kheterata  due  to  their  divine-like  powers  within the lands of Kheterata\nitself,  there  have  only  been two recorded cases of this. Why it is such a rare occasion for\ndirect  rule  from  the  Khet is owed much to the nature of the Khet, as a lazy and decadent\nspecies - too powerful to oust, and very easy to please."

When new religious doctrines need to be approved, they are\nvoted on by the Eldkhet before being presented to the Khetarch for final approval.\n\n===The High Priest===\nThe  High  Priest  of  Elikhet is the voice of the ruling Khetarch, charged with the spiritual\nguidance  of  the faithful just as the Steward of the Sorrow is charged with their protection.\nAlmost always chosen from the priestly lineages of old, the descendants of Elikhet's original\nadvisory  council,  the High Priests command a level of respect in Kheterata second only to\nthe  Khet  themselves  yet  their  actual  power  has  waxed  and  waned,  with  the Steward\ntraditionally   holding   a   stronger   position.  As  with  all  higher  religious  positions  in\nKheterata,  the High Priest is always of strong magical potential and traditionally a graduate\nof the great Black Academy of Muhaqaar.\n\n==History==\nKhetism  has  a  long  and storied history stretching all the way back before the founding of\nany  of  the  greatest  empires.  Originally, the faith revolved around the worship of a single\nKhet,  the  living god known as Elikhet. Shortly before his death, he created the Khetarchy,\nallowing  for  his  legacy to continue on. In his final will, he stipulated the establishment of\nthe   Elder   Council,   to  ensure  that  his  legacy  will  be  maintained  only  by  his  best\ndescendants.\n\nAs  time  has  gone  on,  however,  this  has  proven to not be the case. Typically, the Elder\nCouncil  is populated by the oldest Khet in the family, save for the most elder Khet, who is\ninstead  the  Khetarch.  The  Khet,  in  general, have lost the will or the care to rule. They\nhave  taken  more  pleasure  from  being worshiped, and have demanded increasingly lavish\nlifestyles,  leading  to  most  Eldkhet  and  Khetarchs  being  lazy, uninspired, and decadent\nrulers - leaving the actual ruling to their most favoured Kheteratan subjects instead."

 page_events.817.d: "\nThe Kingdom of Busilar is a country located in the region of Businor.\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe  name Busilar (meaning Northern Hill) stems from its varied origins of its colonizers.\nIts  first name was Busirat (meaning Northern City in Kheteratan), which was the name for\nboth  the  settlement  at  Port  Jaher and the region of Businor as a whole (Businor being a\nblend of the Kheteratan north 'busi' and the Castanorian for land -or).\n\nThe   modern  name  however  derives  from  the  Castanorian  fort  of  Busihyl  (meaning\nNorthern  Hill), which was later converted to Busilar (Lar being Hill in Elven) by the Free\nLeague  forces  during  the  War of the Sorcerer-King, which is still the name of the central\nprovince in Businor to this day.\n\n==History==\n===Founding===\nThe  earliest  incarnation  of  Busilar  was  the  settlement  of  Busirat  in 1486 BA. It was\nestablished  by Elikhet, the first Khet and the founder of Kheterata, as a Kheteratan colony.\nBusirat  would  also become the name for the entire region, which would be called Businor\ntoday.\n\n=== Antiquity ===\nTODO WRITEUP\n\n*  Exchanged  hands  between  Damerian  Republic  and  Castanor a bunch, and periods of\nself-governance\n*Maybe move gnoll mention here as they had to deal with Great Xhaz ones\n\n===Gnollish Tribes===\nThe  gnolls  have  arrived  in  Businor  in  three large migrations, each one stemming from\nstragglers,  deserters  and survivors from a defeated Xhaz, a demonic crusade of gnolls. The\nfirst  and  second were from the Great Xhaz was after the Battle of Burning Hill in 651 BA\nand  in  634  BA  after the Victory of Dostan's Way - while both resulted in defeats of their\nleaders, many gnolls lingered in the lands of Dostanor and The Borders, with many finding\ntheir  home  to  the  inhospitable  and  largely  abandoned  lands of Businor. The third and\nlargest  migration  came  from the Third Xhaz in 669 when Daravan the Malignant flooded\nhis  southern  lands  creating  the  Daravan's  Folly in order to prevent a gnollish invasion.\nWhile  some  gnolls remained in the newfound swamps, many fled to join their brethren in\nBusinor."

Following Elizar's defeat [in\nbattle?   death?],   Busilar   splintered   into  various  warlords,  inaugurating  the  Busilari\nInterregnum,  which  is  considered  a  part  of  the ongoing Interregnum.

They were most known for\ntheir “Scalemail” made from the hide of the nearby kobolds, and for their determination in\ndefending their land from a multitude of invaders.\n\n==History==\nFollowing  the  initial Gawedi conquests into Lencenor in 475 and subsequent repulsion by\nthe  Lorentish  Kingdom  in  530, the Gawedi Kingdom waited for an opportunity to strike\nagain  into  Lencenor  and  the  Small  Country.  Eventually  they were successful when the\nLorentish  Kingdom  went  through  the War of the Three Roses, a civil war, in 600. Their\nhold  was  tenuous  however,  with  many  back  and  forth  conflicts once the civil war had\nended.  The  Gawedi Kingdom created the Kingdom of Eaglecrest, a subject led by a cadet\nbranch  of  the  House of Gawe, to stabilize and hold the region from the Dragonhills. The\ncapital   of   Eaglecrest  being  its  namesake  fortress,  originally  a  fort  of  the  Gnomish\nHierarchy and, after the Last War of Dominion, a bastion of Castanor.\n\nEaglecrest  managed  to  break  free  from  the  Gawedi Kingdom in 795 whilst the Gawedi\ntroops   were   stationed  up  north  preventing  any  Gerudians  from  raiding  their  lands.\nFreedom,  however,  proved to be their downfall. During the Era of Black Ice, the coast of\nEaglecrest  was  vulnerable  to  the  raiders,  no  longer protected by the Gawedi Kingdom.\nLater  in  826,  a  group of raiders led by Askel invaded Eaglecrest; lured there by Iochand,\nEaglecrest’s  rival.  The  raiders  won,  taking  the coastal western portion of Eaglecrest and\nruling  it  as  the  Kingdom of Reveria. Following that, the Gawedi Kingdom vassalized the\nweakened Eaglecrest.\n\nThe  Gawedi  Kingdom  fell  during  the  War of the Sorcerer-King, being attacked on two\nfronts  by  both  Black  Castanor  and the Kingdom of Lorent. The result of the Third Tall\nWar  against  Lorent  in  981  was  the  Gawedi  Kingdom  losing  their  lands in the Small\nKingdom as well as the independence of Eaglecrest.

In 992 Eaglecrest came under siege\nand  was  pushed  back  to  the  Lodan  Crags  where  they  maintained  a  resistance  effort\nthroughout  the  war.  Much  of the Small Country had been liberated by 1002, however it\nwasn’t until 1007 that Eaglecrest was finally liberated, being too far away from Aelcandar to\nbe defensible.\n\nEaglecrest  made  it  out  of  the War of the Sorcerer-King intact and independent, however\nnot for very long. A few decades later the Kingdom of Lorent, with their dominant position\nin the Small Country, conquered Eaglecrest while Gawed was still recovering from the war.\nLater in 1055, Gawed manages to overcome a Lorent weakened by the White Pestilence in\nthe  Fourth  Tall  War  and  annexes  Eaglecrest’s  former lands as well as the lands of what\nbecame the Bluefoot Halflings.\n\n==Economy==\nEaglecrest  had  two  main  products  of  note.  First  of which being their unique scalemail\nfashioned  from  the  scales  procured  from  slain  kobolds.  It  was  noted  as being rather\ndurable  while  maintaining  a light weight. Eaglecrest was also known for their large flocks\nof  sheep,  well  suited  for the Dragonhills. The wool and mutton from them was plentiful\nand a common sight at markets in the area.\n\n==Military==\nThe  military  of  Eaglecrest is a hardy one with a history of defending their land. Being set\nbetween  the Alenic Frontier and Lencenor often made the lands of Eaglecrest a battlefield.\nSometimes,   like   in   the   War   of  the  Sorcerer-King,  Eaglecrest  would  come  under\noccupation.

Farraneán is notable for being a land of rivers and creeks,\nwith   many  such  as  the  Cogaulúis  (Whisperwater)  or  the  Meléthreabáis  (Curseflow)\ntraveling  through  its lands It was ruled by the house síl na Eán, originally known as house\nFarran.  Farraneán's  highest  distinction  is  in  its  existence  as  a  land of equal populace\nbetween   human  and  elves,  which  marks  it  as  uniquely  distinct  from  its  cousins  in\nAnbennar,  who, while overwhelmingly mixed with elven customs, are still overwhelmingly\nhuman  in  numbers.  While  this  may  be  an  artefact  of the fairly rural lands it occupied\n(compared  to  the highly populated cities of Anbennar), this unique situation as a realm of\nequal  parts  has  given  the  Farrani  a unique sense of camaraderie in their shared identity,\nwith both humans and elves occupying positions in the highest to the lowest social strata.\n\n==History==\n===Founding===\nFounded  by  Martin  Farran  during  the  War  of  the Sorcerer King, Farraneán originally\nconsisted  of  the  plain  of  Whistlevale. Though granted de-jure to Ibevar in the Treaty of\nAnbenncóst,  the  young  elfrealm  had no presence within Whistlevale, and the Cursewood\nwas  in  a mostly bloodless revolt against Ibenion's rule. Martin, too, claimed that he had a\nbetter  claim  to  the  region,  as he had settled years before Ibenion had refounded the lost\nCardesti city of Vardoced and laid down his foundations.\n\nEdward  Farran  would  fall for Vehari Tederfremh, the daughter of Variondan Tederfremh,\nforming  the  dynasty  of síl na Eán. With the blooming of The Scogtrín in Escin, the tree's\ngnarled  visage  took  the  place  of the stag on Farrraneán's banner, flying proud above the\ngold and green as a symbol of the newly united nation.\n\n===The White Pestilence===\nThe young kingdom was, prior to its unification with the Ibevari Cursewood, soon beset by\nthe  White  Pestilence,  beginning  a conflict that would ravage the humans' lands, and take\nthe  senior  Farran's  life. However, the conflict deepened Farraneán's ties with the elves of\nthe  Cursewood.  Thanks  to  the  intervention  of  the  Orda  Aldresia's  precursors  in the\nAldresian  Crusade,  a  long  tradition  of Farraneán nobles serving in the order's ranks was\nestablished.  While  the  order  was a diverse and motley collection of souls from all across\nCannor,  it  had  been  said  that  the Farrani, perhaps second only to the Vernmen of their\nsouthern  holdings  were  the  backbone  of its numbers. The havoc that was wreaked upon\nFarrani  land  by  the  conflict  resulted  in  the  creation of the Caseán, the distinct style of\nfortified towns that characterized the land."

However, there were also issues with Arbarani incursions\ndue  to  the  lack  of  a  clear  border between the Cursewood and the contiguous stretch of\nforest  in  the  Marquisate  of  Arbaran.  While  there  were  some  strained  relations with\nAdenica  and other Escanni neighbors, these were often settled in a more chivalric manner,\nwith  duels  or  treaties,  as opposed to the bloody skirmishes that periodically occurred on\ntheir western border.\n\n===The Greentide===\nThe  Kingdom  of  Farraneán  was one of the last to fall to The Greentide, for a number of\nfactors,  most  prominently  its  location  as  one  of, if not the westernmost Escanni realm.\nHowever,  this was also in large part thanks to the Caseán towns that sheltered almost their\nwhole  population  within  their walls, and the great amount of experience that its army had\ngained  in  providing  aid  in  supporting  other  nations against the Greentide. Many of the\nFarrani,  having  experienced  the horrors of the Greentide firsthand, were able to convince\nothers  to  evacuate  when it reached its borders, permitting them a disproportionate rate of\nsurvival   compared  to  relative  population  size,  and  overrepresenting  them  among  the\nGreentide's refugees.\n\n===Seeking Refuge===\nThe surviving Farrani were scattered all across Cannor.

Ibevar, due to its isolationist nature, and\na  strain  of  elven purism had not accepted half-elven and human refugees, but aided those\nthat  crossed  their  borders,  as  well  as  any Farrani elves that would prefer to accompany\nthem  in  finding  quick  transit  to  Aldresia  or  down  the Hehainé to Esmaria. The Orda\nAldresia  had  also  been  the  path  for  the  flight  of  many  Farrani  refugees,  who  were\nresponsible  for  a  boom  in population, as well as the staunch defense that held the line at\nRottenstep,   Tombsvale,  and  other  locales  that  served  as  the  effective  border  to  the\nGreentide."

Proving the most\nresilient  of the Caseán, Freetower hosted the Anbenncóst Expedition and Valefort held out\nlong  enough  to  be  integrated  into  one  of  the  adventurer realms that later occupied its\nformer  lands. These holdouts have led to some regional dispute as to whether the kingdom\ntruly  fell  in 1442, when the last of the síl na Eán fled to Aldresia. Some of these survivors\nalso  joined  up  with  the  Marcher  Lords,  serving  with  distinction  in bands such as the\nAnbenncóst Expedition, Company of the Thorn, and the Warriors of Ancard.\n\n==Society==\n===Martial Traditions===\nThe Farrani martial tradition is noted for its usage of a main body of human cavalry, which\ntruly  excelled  due  to  the  support  of  tightly  integrated elven archers. While the martial\ntraditions  of  small  scale  duels  that  prevailed  in the politics of Chivalric Escann largely\nprevented  these  from  being  used  en  masse, Farraneán's armies proved quite valiant and\neffective  in the sporadic skirmishes and border conflicts with Ibevar and Arbaran that took\nplace throughout its history.\n=== Cogaulúis Ball ===\nThe  Cogaulúis Ball is a celebration in Silversight, established in the tradition of Esmaria's\nriver  parties.  Named for the Cogaulúis, the festival filled the kingdom's rivers with barges\nand  music, and was always said to be the highlight of the year. The tradition was started by\nthe  Esmari  folk  that  Martin  Farran  brought  to the land during the War of the Sorcerer\nKing, and gladly adopted by their human and elven subjects. Soon, the Meléthreabáis filled\nwith  the  same  breed of festive barges and minor tributaries of both filled with simpler log\nrafts  and more humble craft that were no less festive. Thanks to a great fire that had nearly\ndestroyed  Escin  in  its early years, these events were much better regulated than the wilder\nEsmari river parties, which have been known to cause great calamities to this day.\n\n==Geography=="

 page_events.2348.d: "\nThe  de-jure  lands of the kingdom consists of two primary regions. Whistlevale is a grassy\nplain  which  long  held human settlements, conquered by Martin Farran during his time in\nthe  region.  The  Cursewood was a formerly untamed fragment of the Deepwoods that was\nsettled  by  Ibevari  dissidents  due  to the divisive policies of Ibenion I ta'Luneteín, having\nbeen essentially a rebellious province of Ibevar, until its unification with Farraneán.\n\n===Caseán Towns===\nWith  the intrusion of the White Pestilence in the kingdom's early years, many of its towns\nand  cities  took  on  this  distinguishing  trait of Farrani city planning, raising fortifications\nknown  as  Caseán.  These fortified dwellings provided the heart of many Farrani cities and\ntowns.  The  Caseán  allowed  for  the  protection  of  many  Escanni  refugees  during  the\nGreentide,  which  allowed for the Farrani's disproportionate representation in the Escanni\ndiaspora, as compared to their pre-Greentide populations.\n\n==Notable Locations==\n====Escin and The Scogtrín====\nThe  central  courtyard  of  Escin's  palace was home to The Scogtrín, a Cursewood sapling\nrepresenting the union of the kingdom's elves and humans, which served as a focus to tame\nthe  Cursewood's  wild  magics.  Thanks  to  this,  the nation was provided a source of fine\ntimber.  However,  it  never  reached  true  popularity  due  to superstition surrounding the\nname  "Cursewood",  under which it was sold. Nonetheless, that old heartwood lives on in\nthe  few  beloved  heirlooms that its populace were able to carry from their homes, and has\nin  modern  times  enjoyed  a  resurgence  in  popularity,  its distinct black hue making it a\nfriendly  alternative to more expensive lumber from the Deepwoods or other more perilous\nlocales.   Following   Escin's   reclamation   from   orcish  squatters,  a  new  Scogtrín  was\nestablished   on  the  spot  of  the  original.  Local  tradition  holds  it  to  be  a  legitimate\ndescendant,  through  a  sapling  that  was ushered to the Farrani holdout in Valefort, but it\nmay well be merely another tree of the Cursewood's common stock.\n\n"

In the latter half of\nthe  Dragonwake,  the  Kingdom sought safer lands west in Lencenor and fought against the\nnatives  there,  settling  and occupying much of the land until they were pushed out entirely\nin  480  by  Lorenan  the  Great,  the  founder  of  the  Kingdom  of  Lorent - a rival to the\nKingdom of Gawed.\n\n===War of the Sorcerer King===\nDuring  the  final  years  of  the  Late  Castan's  Empire, Gawed was a tributary state to the\nempire,  and  was  later  invaded during the early stages of the War of the Sorcerer-King in\n980,  becoming  the  Vertesk  Dominion  as  a  client  state subject to Black Castanor.

The Ice Giants elevated\nclan  Bigcleaver above the rest to easily control the ogres, wanting to first coerce them with\ntheir  recognition  of  ogre  authority over the Serpent’s Vale, to then use them to fight their\nwar against the Castanorians.\n\nAs  the  Kingdom  grew,  Fathide  Ogre  refugees  had  migrated  to  the Serpent’s Vale and\nintermingled  with  the  Swamp  Ogres,  blending  into a new culture calling themselves the\nMossmouth Ogres. After the collapse of Ghavamregh, these ogres would be split into many\ntribes scattered and disorganised across the Serpent's Vale and Northern Pass.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== First Swamp Ogrish Migration ===\nIn  the  wake  of  Castan  Beastbane’s  purges  of  the  centaurs,  harpies,  and fey, one race\nremained  stalwart  in  the  bogs  of  the  lands  now known as Bal Mire. Despite the ogre’s\nhunger,  they  were often content in remaining in the boggy marshlands and wooded hills of\nnorth-western  Escann,  living  in  small family units or the occasional clan. However, with\nBeastbane’s  purges,  many Swamp Ogres grew nervous, wondering if- or when, the humans\nand their bloodthirsty leader would seek them out.\n\nOne  clan  leader,  of  whom  only  their  epithet  of is remembered as “Crigoc'' by certain\nhistorical  records,  approached  a  hapless Castanorian soldier belonging to a nearby camp\nseeking  centaur  warbands,  and offered to “trade” his clan’s territory in exchange for food,\nsupplies,   and  guarantee  of  passage  north  in  the  broken  local  tongue  spoken  before\nCastanor’s  dominion  over  the  region.  With  one  confused  discussion with the soldier’s\ncommanding  officers later, Crigoc’s clan was soon moving northeast, towards the Northern\nPass  in  573 BA. This seemed to spark a gradual migration, where Castanorians and other\nlocal  tribes were offered swaths of “good land” along the fringe of Bal Mire and the region\nof  later  Vrorenmarch  in  exchange  for  food  and  supplies  to move north. When Jormir\nOnce-Thawed  and  his  Ice  Giants  awoke  in  570 BA, some Swamp Ogres went north to\nGerudia to serve under him, though many still went east, into the Northern Pass."

The clans and individuals that remained were\ntoo  isolated  at  the  time  to  grow worried about human encroachment or receive news of\nJormir, and so remained content in their bogs.\n\n=== Swamp Ogres settle the Serpent’s Vale ===\nBy 545 BA, the Swamp Ogres had migrated into the eastern stretches of the Northern Pass-\ntheir  hunger  forcing  them  to  move  frequently, but the movement of the centaurs before\nthem  had  blazed trails that had yet to have been grown over, and essentially cleared a path\nfor  the ogres to follow in relative peace, unhurried by the ancient tribes and the occasional\ntrollish family unit.\n\nThese  ogres  would  in  turn find the ruins of the dwarves’ ancient irrigation systems in the\nSerpent’s  Vale,  pushed  out  the few orcish tribes and moved into the Serpent's Vale, whos\nirrigation  had  been  despoiled  and  damaged  to  the  point  the  entire  region was now a\nswampland  which  reminded  them  easily  of  their  old  homes.  They  set up small petty\nchiefdoms  of  no  more  than  a  few clans, to a dozen at most, establishing stone hill-forts\nabove   the  swamp  atop  the  long  overgrown  ruin  and  rubble  of  dwarven  settlements,\nfortifications,  and  granaries.  All  they had to contend with was the occasional orcish raid,\nwhich  were  no  real  threat  to  the  ogres within the crumbling ruins of the dwarves' great\nirrigation network.\n\n=== Establishment of Ghavamregh ===\nFollowing rumours and vague tales that some ogres had ventured east by the descendants of\nthe  Swamp  Ogres  who  ventured  north  to  settle  in Jormir’s Realm, a detachment of Ice\nGiants  entered  the  Northern  Pass on behalf of Kranmas, who had a year before slain his\nbrother,  Jormir Once-Thawed, and declared war on Castanor in an attempt to re-establish\nthe Ice Giant’s ancient empire.\n"

This required organisation, and one\nogre  clan  by  the  name  Clan  "Bigcleaver", renamed in dubious honour by the Ice Giant\noverseer  at  the  time,  were elevated as leaders and liaisons of the ogres between them and\nthe  other  giantkin.  Though  in  technicality  there  was  a  single Ice Giant assigned at all\ntimes,  the  “King”  of Clan Bigcleaver was often competent enough to keep the other clans\nin  line,  and so the Ice Giants looked at the post as a punishment more than anything. The\nOgres’  realm  was  established  in  406  BA  and  named Ghavamregh, “Eastern Realm” in\nogrish,  for  Kranmas  desired  no  lands  beyond it. The Bigcleaver Clan was given a giant\nrunestone, covered in Giant Rune, conferring the authority to rule all Swamp Ogre clans in\nthe  Northern  Pass,  and  all  later  “Kings”  of  Ghavamregh  would  use it as a symbol of\nauthority  and  power,  building  their  capital  around  the site of the stone along the south\nshore of Uthojan’s Eye.\n\n=== Second Swamp Ogrish Migration ===\nAs Castanor’s armies began to turn the tide against the Ice Giants, the Swamp Ogres of Bal\nMire  found  themselves  fighting  for  their  very  lives.  Numerous clans, subjugated when\nKranmas’  armies  marched  south  in  377  BA,  now  found  themselves on the run north,\nfleeing  from  vengeful  Castanorians  and  Castan  Giantsbane himself. This migration was\nmore  chaotic  and  haphazard  than the first, as they were primarily displaced ogres fleeing\ngenocide at the hands of Castanor.\n\nSome  ogres  went  north,  and most perished when Gerudia was invaded and Kranmas was\nenchained.  Those  who  fled east, past Cagod’s Watch to Ghavamregh were settled outside\nthe  Serpent’s  Vale  proper  in  a  loose array of tributaries in order to act as a buffer to the\nmore  established-  and  fortified,  older  clans.  Castanor  would  not  send armies beyond\nCagod’s Watch, as the ogres had destroyed many of the roads and bridges on their flight, in\naddition  to  being  more  concerned with projecting power into Gerudia and hunting down\nthe Trolls, who were seen as a larger threat."

These were\nthe  Fathides,  refugees and exiles fleeing the consolidation of the Kingdom of Maghargma.\nWhilst some Fathides during Maghargma’s consolidation were simply pushed north into the\nwoodlands, others clans were forced to go even further beyond due to lack of resources and\nterritory.\n\nMore adjusted to barbaric savagery than the Swamp Ogres, who had for the most part been\ncontent  in  boisterous  wrestling  and  only  the occasional tribal conflict to determine who\nbecomes King of Ghavamregh. Many clans took in these hardened Fathides, who had been\nforced  to  contend with their own kind for many years. At first only as indentured servants\nwho  were  used  as tools and expendable fodder for dealing with various issues, but later as\nmercenaries and sworn warriors.

By this time the tribal\nconfederacy  that  was  the  Kingdom of Ghavamregh had begun to fragment and decay over\nroughly  the  last  100 years, increased by a growing acceptance and conversion to the Feast\nof  the  Gods.  Power  struggles  would  be  marked  not  by  the  banishment  and  exile of\nindividuals,  but  their  consumption,  and  the  position  of King of Ghavamregh would be\nsought after only by the most bloodthirsty individuals, leading their clans to war that would\nend  up  devouring the clans of their enemies and leaving nothing but empty hill forts filled\nwith blood and gristle in their wake."

By  800 the runestone upon the shores of Uthojan’s Eye had long been\ntoppled  and  none cared to upright it again. None outside the immediate area of the ruling\nKing  would submit to their authority, and the title had become so stained with blood none\nwould  seek  it,  leaving  the  bloody  and slow decline of the kingdom to at last come to an\nend.  The  name  Ghavamregh  was left to rot in the swamps, along with the bones of many\nwho had fought for it over the last eight centuries.\n\nEven  then,  the  Ogres  had  developed a taste for the ever-increasingly rare man-flesh, and\nthose  clans  that  could,  would  continue  to  raid human tribes for captives. The Cagodic\npeoples  would  begin  to  move towards the Giant’s Tears, where the Táric peoples already\nlived  and  the  Western  areas  of  the  Northern  Pass,  whilst the Kukatodics would move\nbeyond  the gap of the Giant’s Anvil and Dûr-Vazhatun, beginning a steady depopulation of\nthe human tribes in the region.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

They argued he was a mere imposter, using the Orc god's name as\npretext  for  a  power  grab. Unfortunately, their numbers were inferior to those of Korgus'\nsupporters,  and after a short struggle, these clans were banished from their caves and holds\nin the Serpentspine into the wastes of the Northern Pass.\n\nBrasur  Frozenmaw,  a  young  and  ambitious  chieftain,  whose  father  had  been  slain in\npersonal  combat  by Korgus, was not satisfied with such a fate for his people. He gathered\nthe  other  exiled  clans  and  united  them  through both diplomacy and the slaying of rival\nchieftains.  Quickly  accepted  as Warchief of the orc exiles, he commanded his new united\nclan to begin marching west.\n\nHis  decision  was  one  rooted  in  survival,  for Brasur remembered Korgus' ambition: to\ninvade  the  human  lands  to  the  west  of  Serpentspine.  Obsessed  with  his  role  as the\nself-proclaimed  Dookanson,  Korgus aimed to conquer the surface and eliminate the other\nraces  and  their  gods  in  the  name of the Great Dookan. Brasur knew that while his own\nclans  were too small and weak to compete with those of Korgus, the exiled orcs could still\ncontend  with the humans to the north of the upstart's conquest. That is, if he could use his\nscant resources efficiently.\n\nAnd  so  Brasur's  horde  slowly  proceeded west. In his path, were the savage tribesmen of\nGiant's  Tears, orcs whose skin had turned as gray as the lands they lived in. Brasur quickly\ncrushed  them  underfoot  and learned of a promising opportunity from the defeated locals.\nThe  Kingdom  of  Vrorenmarch  to the west was weak-- its king was struggling to keep the\ncountry  and  its  quarrelsome  subjects  in line.

The vacuum of power left by the\nking's  absence  left  Vrorenmarch  vulnerable.  The  kingdom's nobility was unified in one\nidea  only-- that their land was the most important. From the lowest counts to the grandest\ndukes,  none made the effort to present a unified front against Brasur's horde. Instead, they\ncommanded  their personal armies to protect their own fiefs within the kingdom's territory.\nThis  lack  of  organization sealed their fate. In the following five years, one by one, Brasur\nsubjugated  all  the wayward lords of Vrorenmarch. Those who gave the strongest resistance\nwere  made  examples  of.

Rest of the family and potential claimants were slain several weeks\nbefore  the  coronation  to  eliminate  possible pretenders to the new royal dynasty. Several\nmonths later Frida gave birth to a half-orc son of Brasur, Marosh Frozenmaw.\n\nUnexpectedly,  for  human  nobility,  the  new  ‘king’ fearsomely resisted the Greentide and\nprotected  the  borders  of  his  new  domain,  killing  any  green orc warband, who tried to\ninvade  Vrorenmarch.  When  green  orcs  were  defeated  in Vrorenmarch in 1442, Brasur\neven  started  his  own  invasion  in  Escann  with  the help of his new human retainers and\nhoped  to  slain Dookanson with his own hands to avenge his father, but Corin managed to\nreach Korgus before him."

But many\norcish  clans  strongly  resisted  this  changes. Some of previously subjugated clans rebelled\nand  tried  to  take power in their hands, but was ultimately defeated in 1440. Remnants of\nthese clans, like Broken Jaw, retreated to Giant's Tears to live independently from Brasur's\nHorde.\n\nAs a conqueror, Brasur imposed heavy taxes on the population of the former Vrorenmarch,\nwhich made the population of the former kingdom grumble, but the memories of the bitter\ndefeat  and  the  destroyed  castles  of  the  rebellious  lords were too fresh for the locals to\ndecide  to  rebel.

And he hoped\nthat  the  orcs  would  remain  in the Vrorenmarch forever. Therefore, he did not decide to\nwin  the  favor  of  the  local  people  as  a  merciful ruler, but decided to play the role of a\nruthless and cruel tyrant until the very end of his days. But Brasur managed to leave a good\nmemory about himself even among humans.\n\nOrcish  rule  in  Vrorenmarch  could  not  fail  to  attract  the  attention of adventurers and\nmercenaries,  who  did  not  have  time  to  snatch  their  piece  of  the  pie in Escann. The\nadventurers began to cross the border of the kingdom and attack the tribes of gray orcs who\nsettled  forests  of  the Alenic Reach, but it became a problem only in 1450s. The leader of\nthe  invading  adventurer's  army  was  Crovis  Ginnfield,  a  nobleman  from Gawed, who\ndecided  to  become  an  adventurer,  being  the  youngest  son  of  a  noble  family and not\ncounting  on  a  large  inheritance  in  his  homeland.  Inspired  by  the  Cobalt  Company,\nCorintar and the Sons of Dameria, he hoped that his own army of mercenaries could easily\nenlist  the  support  of  the  local  human  population  and  present  him  with the crown of\nVrorenmarch  on  a  silver  platter.  When Crovis and his army crossed the border between\nEsald  and  Gawed,  the  locals  joyfully  opened  the  gates  of the city, welcoming them as\n"saviors  of  Vrorenmarch"  and  begging Crovis “to quickly kill the monster that settled in\nBal Vroren”."

He himself, leading\nthe  horde  of  gray orcs, began to "follow" the army of Crovis. The aristocrat from Gawed\nmanaged  to  gather  many  adventurers  and  mercenaries  under  his banner, and although\nBrasur  was  sure  that  he  could well defeat them in a direct confrontation, he preferred to\nwait and let the “saviors” show their true nature.\n\nThe  Gray  Orcs  were  poorer  than  the  green  Escanni  raiders,  and many of them, upon\nhearing of the invasion, began to abandon their new settlements in Vrorenmarch to join the\nBrasur's   horde.   Army   of   Crovis,   eager  for  loot  and  money,  grumbled  about  the\nunprofitability  of  the  campaign,  and  the  supplies that the townsfolk and peasants of the\nReach  gave  them  were  running out too quickly. The army of adventurers needed a way to\nsolve  these  problems  that  faced  them. And they found the solution in the local humans,\npardoned  by  Brasur  and  preserved  their  cities  and  riches  and  at the same time gladly\nopened  the  gates  of  their  cities  for  adventurers.  "Saviors" sieged and assaulted human\ncities,  plundering  them  for  food and loot, which infuriated the local residents and turned\ntheir  sympathies  over  to the side of the orcs, who had spared them in their time. Soon all\nthe  cities  refused  to open the gates for the adventurer's army, and the local lords began to\nsend their militia to Brasur.\n\nIn  the  end,  Crovis,  abandoning  the  hope  of  using  the  locals  and hoping to somehow\nmaintain his authority in the eyes of his thinning army, laid siege to the castle of Eskerborg,\none  of  the  few  castles  preserved  in  Vrorenmarch.  He  hoped  to  make  it  a  base  for\nconquering  the  country. However, the united army of local human lords and Brasur's orcs\nutterly   defeated   the   adventurer's  army  without  any  significant  losses,  and  scattered\nmercenary  squads  rushed  to  leave  the  territory  of  the  Alenic  Reach. Crovis' invasion\nconvinced  the  locals that they could not count on outside help to solve their problems and\nhumbled  them  with  the  Orc conquest. Joint war smoothed tensions between humans and\norcs and the first half-orcs from voluntary marriages were born throughout the country."

Therefore,\nduring his reign, he began to settle orcs from his own and loyal tribes across the territory of\nWrorenmark.  He  generously gave them free houses and allocated land for construction in\ncities  and  villages.  Towards the end of his life, many members of his own clan acquired a\nhousehold  and  began  to  wean  themselves  from  the  nomadic,  tribal way of life, slowly\ngetting  used  to  a  sedentary  life  and  its  customs,  abandoning  the  old ways. It is these\nsedentary  orcs that will become the new support for the power of the subsequent Grombar\nkings.\n\nWith  these  actions, Brasur prepared the ground for the ascension to the throne of his son,\nMarosh.\n\n==== Marosh Frozenmaw (1469 AA - 1481 AA)====\nThe  death  of Brasur and the subsequent coronation of Marosh were a turning point in the\nhistory  of  Grombar  and  the  entire  Alen  Reach. The orcs looked at the half-breed with\nsuspicion,  doubting  that he had the strength of his father's character and his talent to hold\non  to  power. Humans, however, carefully tried to understand whether it would be another\nbarbarian on the throne or human blood would dilute the wild fury of the orc.\n\nNobody  could  guess the result. To his coronation, Marosh invited both humans and orcs.\nDuring  the  ceremony,  the  young  king  declared  that the orcs and humans alike were his\nsubjects,  for only together they could overcome the dangers surrounding the Vrorenmarch,\nthe  Gerudian raiders from the north and the green orcs from the south. As an example, he\ncited  the joint struggle of the inhabitants of Vrorenmarch - both orcs and humans - against\nthe  invasion  of  Crovis,  to  which  both  peoples  contributed  equally.

Many orcs challenged Marosh after\nthis speech, but he was able to defeat all of his opponents in ritual duels of Ozarm'chadash,\nwhich  convinced  the  orcs of the half-orc's power and forced them to submit to him. That\nwas   first   signs   of  orcish  tribes  losing  power  over  country.  In  later  years  Marosh'\ndescendants  will  abolish orc clans completely and will settle them across the whole Alenic\nReach.\n\nDuring  his  rule  Marosh focused mostly on dealing with internal problems of his country,\nbut there is always an exception for any rule. In 1475 Marosh boldly decided to travel with\nhis  warriors  in  Escann  to  meet  with another famous half-orc, yet from a human world -\nLothane  Bluetusk.  Disguised  as  a  simple  mercenary band captain, he managed to reach\nIonntras.

Convinced by half-orc king's promises of protecting humans in his realms,\nLothane  agreed  to  pay  a  return  visit  to  former  Vrorenmarch. Most cities were already\nrestored  and  resettled  by  both  humans  and  orcs  by  the  time of his visit and this sight\nconvinced  Lothane  that  Frozenmaw may not be as monstrous as they are seen by the most\nof  Cannor.  That's  why  he  agreed  to  publicly  announce  alliance  with  Gray  Orcs.  It\ninfuriated  many  other  adventurers  and  feudal  kings  in  Cannor, however gave Corintar\npowerful ally for many decades.\n\nHowever,  this alliance sowed discontent among Orcs of Frozenmaw. Alliance with 'human\nweaklings'  was seen as sign of weakness and despair of half-orc king, so they renewed their\nattempts  to  question  his  rule.  In  1481 they finally achieved their goal when orc named\nThrur  slayed Marosh in ritual duel. Unfortunately for him, he did not manage to make use\nof  his  victory  -  human  and  half-orc  nobility  refused to accept results of such duel and\ncrowned  Marosh'  son,  Gunk, instead of Thrur.

Only  time  will  tell  if that will remain the case as the\nnation is already beset on all sides by potential oppressors.\n\n==Ancient Kheterata==\nKheterata was first founded by Elikhet almost three thousand years before the Day of Ashen\nSkies.  He  sought  to  free  those  who  worshiped  him  from  the oppression of the Genie\nSultanates  and  earned himself the epithet of "The Renouncer", as he abdicated Heaven to\nguide  the  Kheteratan  people  from  Bulwar  to  their  new  home  in  the Salahad Desert.\nNirakhet,  Elikhet's  mother,  wept  for  the sacrifice her son had made, and from her tears\nflowed the great river, now known as Mother's Sorrow.

The  region  of  Akasik  would  be  integrated  into  the Kingdom of\nKheterata in this period, following the conquest of the local queendoms.\n\n==The Many Subjugations of Kheterata==\nAs  the era of Ancient Bulwar drew to an end, so did Ancient Kheterata. The colonies were\nrazed,  and  the  central government fell apart. In Kheterata's greatest time of need, Elikhet\nearned  himself  a  new  name as Elikhet the Provider as he saved many lives from death by\nproviding  a  bountiful  feast  for  all  Kheteratans. However, this was not to last. Soon, the\nGnolls  invaded,  and  for  the  first  time,  Kheterata was subjugated.

To save himself from a short reign and\nensure  that  the  Khetarchs would remain the primary key to power in the nation, Sentkhet\nceded  rule  to  the  Gnollish  ruler, The Xhazobine.

Aside  from  the Oni of Azjakuma in Yanshen, Maghargma is\none  of  only two ogre states to survive into the modern era. For the history of the kingdom\nbefore its centralization under Ziltagh, see the Ogre Valley Timeline.\n\n==Administrative Centralization==\nWhen  Ziltagh Gravelhide took the throne of Maghargma in 1440, he blamed the decadent\nand  ineffective  Great  Clan  system  of  the  previous centuries for the devastation that the\ncentaurs  were  able  to  inflict  upon  the  Ogre  Valley.  Once  the  last of the hordes were\ndefeated,  Ziltagh  would  make  it  his  mission to drag the kingdom out from the past and\nreforge it in his own image.\n\nHowever,  one  significant  obstacle  stood  between him and his vision; the royal army was\nheavily  depleted by the fight against the centaurs, while many of the personal armies of the\nGreat  Clans  weathered  the invasion holed up in their kelaktars. Ziltagh may have had the\nadoration  of  his  people,  but  he  lacked  the  force  to do anything with it. Any move too\ndrastic  would  result  in yet another civil war in the Valley, one which he doubted he could\nwin.\n\nIn  a  turn  of  diplomacy  heretofore  unheard  of from the Mengur’ms before him, Ziltagh\nwould  adopt  a  two-pronged  strategy. First, to deal with the most ardent opponents to his\nplanned  reforms,  Ziltagh  would play their egos off of each other. Through the granting of\nmeaningless  titles  and  insinuations of weakness, Ziltagh was able to convince his enemies\nto  willingly  throw  their  forces  at  centaur splinter hordes, Wild Ogres, and in a rare few\noccasions,  each  other.  By  the  time the first part of his plan was complete, the Kingdom\nhad  secured its border against the chaos of the plains, and had established nominal control\nover the Wild Ogres of the north.\n\nWith  his  enemies weakened, and his own armies replenished, Ziltagh executed the second\nstep  of his plan. The Ojkagmas of the six Great Clans were summoned to the capital for a\ngrand  Nykha  Tolutsdi  (Ogrish  New Year) feast. Upon their arrival, Ziltagh ensured that\nthe  whole  of  the  royal  army  was  there  to  greet  them, bedecked in their finest regalia,\nmaking  for a fearsome display of power. After the celebrations, each of the Ojkagmas were\nindividually  approached  with  an  ultimatum:  surrender  your lands to the crown without\ndelay.  Cooperators  would  earn  comfortable appointments in the new administration, but\nresistors  would  be  crushed  without  remorse.  Each  knowing the state of their weakened\narmies,  and  unable  to  coordinate  with  each  other, all six Great Clans would choose to\nbend the knee, forever changing the Fathide political landscape overnight."

 page_events.2374.d: "\n\n==Religious Reform==\nBeginning  in  the early 16th century, the Kingdom of Maghargma would be heavily shaped\nby the changes happening in the Western Dwarovar. As the Serpent’s Vale was reconquered\nby  Dwarven  reclaimers,  small  bands  of  displaced  Mossmouth  Ogres  would take their\nchances   fleeing   east   to   seek   protection   from  the  so-called  “Lord  of  All  Ogres.”\nSimultaneously,   the   rulers  of  Maghargma  were  undergoing  their  own  problems;  the\ncentralized   administration   was   surprisingly   effective  at  keeping  internal  strife  to  a\nminimum.  Such  an  unprecedented  stretch  of  peace  was  leading to unrest among pious\nIskerag  Vulshorites,  who  believed  that  without constant consumption ogres’ souls would\nstagnate, as well as a surge in population that was beginning to get difficult to feed.\n\nAs   the  first  bands  of  Mossmouths  reached  the  northern  border  of  Maghargma,  the\nMengur’m  took  the  gamble  to  allow  them  entry.  Though  already  straining  under the\npressure  of  a growing population, turning them away would potentially be seen as a failure\nin  his  duty  as “Lord of All Ogres” and only further tarnish his slipping legitimacy. As the\nnews  made  its way back to the Vale of the Mengur’m’s decision, the trickle of Mossmouths\nwould soon become a stream. The challenges of taking them in would prove numerous, but\nwould, in many ways, prove to be a boon for the rulership of the Kingdom.\n\nProtected by the forests to their north and the walls of their valley everywhere else, Fathide\nculture  had  grown  to  have  a  sense  of  insularity. To most ogres, their whole world was\nconfined to their geographic boundaries; stray too far from home and you face madness and\nstarvation  in  the  wilderness  as  the  Sandmaws  did.  The  average  Fathide thought their\ncivilization  to  be  invincible  and eternal. However, the fate of the Mossmouths put many\nogres  on  edge;  the  two civilizations were not too dissimilar from one another; both came\nfrom  unusually  fertile  regions  cradled  within  secure geographical defenses. Though the\nMossmouths  may  not  have  been  violently expelled, the idea that ogres could be made to\nbend  the  knee  to  non-ogres  was seen as an unbearable disgrace. Historians point to this\ncultural exchange as the beginning of a fundamental shift in Maghargman doctrine, because\nthe  Mossmouths  had  grown  too  comfortable  in their swamps and had died isolated and\nstagnant,   the  Fathides  must  look  outwards  to  survive.  Where  before  the  Kingdom’s\nhistorical focus had been on drawing resources in to the valley, following generations would\ninstead  adopt  a  mindset  of  expansion,  using  the  resources of their homeland to spread\nogrekind outwards."

The warlordism that the\nMossmouths  had  been  mired  in  over the following centuries, combined with their more\nfrequent  interactions  with  Wild  Ogres, led to Mossmouth religious practices taking on a\nmuch  more  brutal  nature,  one  entirely incompatible with a settled society. It was in this\nthat  the  rulers  of  the  Kingdom  saw  an  opportunity.  It  was  clear  that the old ways of\nthinking  were  holding  Maghargma  back  from  truly  stepping  into  modernity,  and  the\nnewfound need for doctrinal control was the perfect way out. Framed as a necessity to keep\nnew  strains  of Mossmouth religious practice from gaining a foothold, Iskerag Vulshor was\ngradually   transformed   by  royal  decree  over  the  following  centuries  into  a  “softer,''\ncentralized religion. As to not risk too much political instability, the Mengur’ms engaged in\nthe  reforms would frequently take to launching raids against nearby centaur hordes to keep\ntheir traditionalist opponents content.\n\n==Goblin Influx==\nFollowing  not  too  far  behind  the  Mossmouths  were  another  group  displaced  by  the\nchanging  political landscape within the Western Dwarovar: the goblins. More particularly,\na  clan  known  as  the  Web Cleaners. As the Spiderwretch clan rose to prominence within\nthe  spider  tunnels  that  form  the  southern  barrier of the Ogre Valley, the Web Cleaners\nwere  faced  with a decision: retreat ever deeper into the caves to maybe live another day, or\ngamble  everything  on an exodus to the surface. Tales had long been told amongst the Web\nCleaners  of tunnels leading out of the dark into a land of titans with endless fields of crops\nand  livestock,  and  the chieftain decided to put his faith in these rumors. Loading all they\ncould onto their pack-spiders, a great caravan headed out into the light.\n\nSo  many  legs skittering across the desert kicked up a sand cloud that could only mean one\nthing  to  the ogres: an approaching centaur horde. When the goblin exodus finally reached\nthe  valley’s  eastern  edge,  they  were greeted with a complete regiment of ogre soldiers on\nhigh-alert.  The Web Cleaner chieftain immediately prostrated himself before the surprised\ncommander,  begging  to  be  brought  before  his leader, signing aggressively an attempt to\nrequest  an  audience with their leader. The point was eventually communicated, but it was\nlikely  only  due  to  goblin’s bony builds that the envoy was not made a snack on the way to\nthe  capital.  Upon  arrival  at the royal palace, the chieftain once again prostrated himself,\nnow  before  the  Mengur’m, and signaled a mage in his envoy to communicate his requests\nthrough conjured illusions."

 page_events.2376.d: "\n\nThe Mengur’m’s closest advisors immediately counseled against accepting the goblins' plea,\nasserting  that  they  were  far  too  diminutive  to  serve  as any meaningful source of food.\nFurthermore,  they  weren’t even ogres, and therefore there was no moral obligation to look\nafter  the  state of their souls. However, the Mengur’m had taken a particular liking to their\nappearance  and  demeanor,  finding  their weakness endearing. Once they realized that his\nheart  was  set,  the  Mengur’m’s  councilors  barely  managed  to convince their lord on the\nmerits  of a stipulation to add to the kingdom’s acceptance: the goblins would be welcomed\ninto  Maghargma,  but they would henceforth all be the personal slaves of the Mengur’m in\nperpetuity.  Determining  slavery  to  be  a  preferable  alternative  to  extinction,  the Web\nCleaner chieftain accepted, and the gates to the valley were opened to his people.\n\nDespite  all  being slaves from a legal standpoint, most goblins were allowed to freely move\nthroughout  the  valley,  settling  where  they pleased. In fact, being slaves to the Mengur’m\nhimself  held  some  benefits,  as  any  nativist  violence  directed  against  them  would  be\nconsidered  destruction  of  royal  property,  a  high  crime. Their small stature made them\nperfect  for  work in mines and other hard-to-reach areas, contributing to a boom in ogrish\neconomic  capacity.  Many  others  would  find  themselves  working  as  servants to ogrish\nfamilies  of  means, as many ogres shared the Mengur’m’s bemusement at their appearance.\nMost  would  take  to  living  in  the  attics or crawlspaces of ogre households, finding such\nunutilized spaces to be more than enough room for their needs.\n\nIn  the  following  years,  many  more  goblins  would  follow  the Web Cleaners out of the\nSerpentspine.  Combined  with  a much higher natural fertility rate, goblins would come to\nbe  a  significant  portion  of  the  Maghargman  population.  New  arrivals  would find the\ngoblins  already  living  there  to  be  almost alien in manner; most spoke ogrish, and many\npartook  in religious ceremonies and feasts alongside their ogrish neighbors. The ogres, for\ntheir  part,  would  come to view the goblins as almost equals, especially amongst the lower\nclasses.  Pleased by the positive effects that this new influx of manpower provided, the ogre\nkingdom  would  sponsor  efforts  to  acquire  ever  more goblin slaves from the Dwarovar,\neither through trade, or by force."

 page_events.2377.d: "\n\nGiven  the already high urbanization in the Ogre Valley, along with access to a major river,\nthe  arrival  of  the  goblins  was  the  final  condition  needed  to  spark  a proto-industrial\nrevolution  within  the valley. Goblin inventiveness combined with centuries of engineering\nexpertise  on  the  part  of the ogres led to a surge in technological advancements. The only\nthings  that  held  Maghargma back from independently approaching parity with Cannorian\ntechnology  was  the  fact that goblins frequently were deprived a choice of employment, as\nwell  as  a  lack of magical and scientific institutions to build off of. Furthermore, the Web\nCleaner clan was one of the least advanced clans from amongst their brethren, having never\ncontrolled a hold to protect them while they explored the sciences.\n\n==Contact with Grombar==\nFar   to   the   northeast   of   the  Ogre  Valley,  yet  another  group  was  approaching  the\nMaghargmans,  destined  to  change  their civilization once again. However, unlike the first\ntwo,  these  newcomers  would  arrive  from  a  position  of  strength, not weakness. As the\nborders  of Grombar crawled across the frozen expanse of the Northern Pass, their colonial\nvanguard  would  be  the  first  Cannorians  to  make  contact with the land of the Ogres in\nrecorded history. Where they had been expecting an abandoned wasteland on the far side of\nthe  Serpentspine,  Grombari  diplomats  were  overjoyed  to find an array of valuable trade\npartners  to engage with, finally promising a reward for the costly push east. For their part,\nthe rulers of Maghargma were equally enthusiastic with the possibilities introduced by their\nnewfound  neighbors.  Once  the  language barrier was crossed, the two kingdoms were fast\nfriends, and were quick to hammer out trade agreements between themselves.\n\nMaghargman  merchants  would  soon  find a valuable market in providing for the material\nneeds  of Grombari settlers arriving ahead of the progress of civilization. The journey from\nthe  Grombari heartland was treacherous enough alone, so bringing any significant quantity\nof  resources  was  often  out  of  the  question. However, faced with the reality of long and\nharsh  winters, few had the ability to produce what they needed to survive their first year in\nthe  wilderness.  Enter, a veritable army of ogrish lumber and livestock salesmen. For their\ntrouble, Maghargmans would turn around and use this newly-acquired stream of Cannorian\ncapital  to  import  the  heretofore-unknown  fruits  of  a  global  market.  From  advanced\ntechnology to exotic flavors, ogrish society was enthralled by what Halann had to offer."

 page_events.2378.d: "\n\nBefore  long  it  was  clear  that  the  economies  of  the  two  kingdoms were codependent;\nwithout  Maghargman  help,  the Grombari frontier would collapse, and without Grombar,\nthe  Maghargmans  would  be  cut  off  from the global market. This relationship would be\ntested  when  Grombari  settlers  finally  arrived at the sea, a shoreline already inhabited by\nTriunic settlers. Tensions rose between the two rival powers, with both threatening military\nintervention  over the fate of the colonies. However, when Grombari soldiers marched into\nthe  scattered  villages along the coast, detachments of Ogres would march alongside them.\nUnwilling  to  spill  blood  over  such  unproductive settlements, Kalsyto would back down\nfrom  the  confrontation,  but  the  crisis  would  leave  a  sour  taste  in  the mouths of the\nTriunics, leading to a quick decline in trade relations with their neighbors.\n\n==Early Industrialization==\nWith  the  injection  of  advanced  industrial  aid,  direct  from  Cannor,  the Maghargman\nindustry  would explode in the late 18th century. Given the already high cultural value that\nogres  placed  on  the  consumption  of  resources,  ogrish  society  was primed to embrace\nindustrial   capitalism   with   a  religious  zeal.  As  a  popular  quote  goes,  spoken  by  a\nMaghargman  diplomat  to  their  Grombari  hosts,  “A  follower  of  your  Falah may see a\nfactory  belching  smoke  and weep tears of despair at the fall of nature, we ogres weep too;\nwe  weep  tears  of  joy  at our conquest over it.” As the Maghargman economy boomed, it\nsoon  became  clear  that  the ogre’s thirst for material resources outstripped their ability to\nimport  or  produce  them.  In  order  to  remedy  this looming issue, thousands of goblins\nwould  be  reminded of their chains, and called up to work on massive mining installations\nalong the walls of the Serpentspine.\n\nAs the ogres surged ahead in technological progress, fast approaching Cannorian standards,\nthey   would   begin  to  even  pay  back  their  intellectual  debts  to  the  continent.  Their\nfascination  with  the  megastructures  of  their  giant  forefathers, combined with their long\nstanding  architectural  ingenuity  would  lead  to  a  number  of ogrish names appearing in\ninternational mathematical and scientific engineering publications."

It was resurrected in\n1377 with Galadorn's Rebellion.\n\nDubbed  "The  City  of Warriors", Malacnar is also the name of the kingdom's capital, its\nsize  actually  closer  to that of town by Cannorian standards. It is located on the west bank\nof the aptly-named Malacynn river, a tributary of the Ynn River in Dolindha.\n\n==Society==\n===The Battleking===\nMalacnar's  ruler  is  known  as  Battleking  (''Bojnaedar''  in  Dolindhan)  and the title is\nclaimed  by the city's strongest warrior each time the previous monarch dies. The strongest\nwarrior is determined through a combination of status and competitions.\n\nTo  maintain  his legitimacy, a Battleking is expected to lead the warriors in battle and fight\nat the front of the battle formation.\n\nIn  its  earliest  history,  Malacnar's  rulers  were  simply  referred  to  as King (Dolindhan\n''Vyledar'' or Malacnari ''Vlodar''), and the term Battleking only appeared from the fourth\ncentury  onwards.  Nonetheless,  it  is  also  accepted  to refer to Malacnar's earliest rulers\n(such  as  Morvarad  and  Vatrevid  IV)  as  Battleking.  The only exception to this is King\nLevodas  himself,  whose  mythical  status  is  enhanced by referring to him with a different\ntitle compared to the rulers of modern-day time.\n\nWhile  there  is  no  rule stating that a Battleking must fight to the last if defeated in battle,\nevery  past  ruler  of  Malacnar  who has been defeated in battle has seen their end that way,\neither by giving their life willingly to buy the warriors time to retreat, or by being encircled\nand forced to fight to the end.\n\n==History=="
 page_events.2379.t: "Kingdom of Malacnar 2 / 4"
 page_events.2379.d: "\n===Founding in the First Century===\nMalacnar's  settlement  was  founded  sometime in the second half of the first century after\nAsh.  Its founding is attributed to the legendary figure of Levodas, who settled down after a\ntime  in  which he "wandered the lawless wilderness with his companions". From Levodas,\ntwo  important  anecdotes  survive,  both  relating  to  his  stoic  warrior  nature and how it\nextended to his leadership.\n\n===Subjugation under Lukaus's Realm===\nAt  the turn of the first century after Ash, an event known as the Great Ride of Lukaus took\nplace.  During  it,  Lukaus and his people descended on the north-central Ynn River Valley\nriding  their mighty Antler Horses, and soon they established themselves as the overlords of\nthe region, dubbing it Dolindha.\n\nMalacnar's  King  at  that  time  was slain by a companion of Lukaus, named Celatan, who\nwent on to rule Malacnar as a vassal to Lukaus.\n\n===Overthrow of the Dolindhans and Resurgence===\nAfter  Celatan's  death,  his  son  was deemed too weak to ascend as ruler of Malacnar, and\nthe  warriors  thus  banished  him  from  the  city,  throwing off Dolindhan dominance and\nelecting Morvarad, one of their own, as their new King.\n\nThis  happened around 122 AA, coinciding with Lukaus's death: fortuitously for Malacnar,\nLukaus's  successor  Aollus  didn't  hold the same amount of power his father did, and was\nunable to bring the might of united Dolindhans against Malacnar.\n\nAollus  went  to  war  with  Malacnar,  however he failed to push back against the warriors,\nwho continued making gains along the Malacynn tributary of the Ynn River. In 142, Aollus\nagreed  to meet Malacnar's king Morvarad for a decisive showdown in what became known\nas  the  Battle  of  the  Mud,  where  he  lost  his  life  fighting  against Morvarad. Aollus's\nkingdom,  based  in  Lukausta,  soon dissolved as Lukausta fell the mountain population of\nthe  Brefineis.

The Hunt of Kril Ribnan, a\nWendigo-slaying competition, is organized to settle a territorial dispute over the territory of\nmodern-day  Mocbarja.  However  the  competition ends in a draw, and neither party backs\ndown,  thus  sparking  the  War  of the Confluence which will last until the end of the third\ncentury after Ash.\n\nProlonged   warfare   leads   to  both  parties'  decline  and  while  Malacnar  is  ultimately\nvictorious and annexes its rival it has to pay a heavy cost.\n\n===Fall and Rebellion===\nBy  304  AA  the Trojvare League had been reformed into the Kingdom of Vareynn and his\nfounder,  King  Munaqir  the  Pious,  had  been  usurped by his son Komerjon. In 312 AA\nKomerjon  declared  war on Malacnar and he was met by King Vatrevid IV of Malacnar at\nthe Battle of Drevonbost.\n\nThe  battle  proved disastrous for Malacnar, whose warriors were encircled and slain to the\nlast.

It was bordered to its east by the Serpentspine and to its south\nby  the  Deepwoods.  It  was known for having been the sole polity in Escann to survive the\nGreentide,  as  well  as one of the few human polities to rule a dwarven hold in the form of\nits capital, Marrhold.\n\n==History==\n===Pre-Alenics and Marrhold Hold===\nVery  little  is  known  about  Marrholds  ancient  past.  Only  it's  original dwarven name,\nÂnumdihr  has  survived  to  modern  day.  It  is  debated  if  that  was it's actual name or a\ndwarven  nickname  that was given after the fall of the Aul-Dwarov. Modern archaeologists\nbelieve  that  its  ancient  dwarven  inhabitants  collapsed the surface gates and much of the\nhold  itself  around  6000 BA, which aligns with the supposed start date of the Last Days of\nDwarovar.

Afterwards they\nwere offered land to settle within modern day Anbennar by the Damerians, but they refused\nand  after  a  rather eventful migration across Korbarid territory, they ended up in Southern\nEscann,  where  they  settled Marrvale and its surrounding areas, and most importantly, the\nabandoned  dwarven  hold  of  Ânumdihr,  which  they  renamed  Marrhold. Concurrently,\nUlric,  the Griffon Prince son of King Marr, the founder of the kingdom, domesticated the\ngriffons  who  populated  the  area  and became the first of the Griffon Riders of Marrhold,\nsoon to be known as Griffon Knights."

Like many in the region, Vrorenmarch began as a\nprovince of Castan's Empire, before gaining independence during its decline. Vrorenmarch\nis most notable for its namesake, the castanorian citadel of Bal Vroren, which defended the\nempire during the Giant's War, when the last of the true giants invaded Castanor. In recent\nhistory  Vrorenmarch  was  conquered  by the gray orc Brasur Frozenmaw conquered in the\n1420s.\n\n==History==\n===Bal Vroren and Giant's War===\nFor much of its history many saw the northern fringes of Castanor as redundant and simply\na  place  to  send  disloyal  soldiers  as  punishment. The lands were inhospitable, its tribes\nwere  poor  and destitute, and the giantkin trolls and ogres were content to being left alone,\nthat  is,  until  570  BA  when  news  came  from  Gerudia that an army of true giants were\nthawed and united the lands under their king, Jormir Once-Thawed. This news accelerated\nthe need for greater defenses, and by 546 BA the citadel of Bal Vroren was finished: Balgar\nthe  Builder's  last  and  greatest  work,  and specifically designed to prevent an invasion by\ngiantkind and their gerudian subjects.\n\nHowever, it was only in 407 BA, 140 years after, that the giants attacked, after Jormir, who\nhad  proved to be a peaceful king, was slain by his brother Kramnas. The following Giant's\nWar  tested the lengths of Balgar's defenses and the siege of the citadel and its mighty walls\nthat  stretched  along  the  Vroren  River  held  firmly  three  years  when  the ordinary fort\nwould've  been  destroyed  in  minutes. It is said that the fort would've lasted years, but the\ngiants  had  built  a temporary bridge across the Serpentshead to simply circumnavigate the\nissue  and  attack  from  behind  Castanorian  lines.  What  followed  was a great period of\ncatastrophy  that  nearly  ended the empire, and it was only in 379 that the tide turned, and\nby  373  at  the  start of the Giantbane War that Bal Vroren was recaptured and served as a\nstaging  point  of  Castan  Giantbane's  war  of  extermination  in  Gerudia. In 357 the war\nended,  and  Kramnas  became  the  last  of  the  true  giants and was enslaved, now forever\nknown  as  Kramnas the Chained: it is said that Kramnas himself helped repair the damage\nhis kind did to Castanor, including repairing Bal Vroren."

With\nthis Vrorenmarch became the de-facto capital of the northern reaches of Castanor, and Isle\nVroren  became  a  modest port shipping goods back and forth from the Dalr Valley.

These  blades,  renowned  for  the zealously\nguarded  enchantment magics that the blacksmiths have put on them, are said to be capable\nof  cleaving  entire  boulders  without bending or dulling.

The\nVermillion  Throne  itself  is  the  seat  of the Zyujyut ruler's power, a brilliant pinkish-red\nthrone  that  dates itself back to an old Righteous Path folk story of the Bokai people there.\nThe  king  of  Zyujyut is expected to perform various ceremonies and rituals to honor their\nancestors.\n\n==Gender Society==\nZyujyut is divided into strict gender roles throughout its society where men and women are\nallowed  to  only  work  certain  professions,  with traditionally masculine roles such as the\nking, soldiers, and farmers being filled by a man, while traditionally feminine roles such as\ntailors, cooks, and teachers are always filled by a woman.\n\nThe  key  difference  between  Zyujyuts  gender  roles  and  that  of  other  societies  is that\nalthough  the  role  is  always  a man or a woman, the actual gender of the person at birth is\nirrelevant, only being decided by the profession. For example, the ruling king of Zyujyut in\n1444  whilst  dressing  as a man and presenting a masculine front, even being referred to as\nhe, was assigned female at birth."

Blacksmiths  and  others that work with heavy metals, especially for\ntools  and  weapons,  are  always  male,  whilst  whitesmiths  and  tinsmiths who work with\nlighter metals or do artistic pieces on metal, are always female.\n\n===Difficulties===\nThe  strictness  of  Zyujyut's  gender  society  has brought with it difficulties, such as that a\nchild  who  refuses to conform to tradition is likely to be frowned upon or even completely\nostracized  from  the  family.  It  is frowned upon if you wish to change from one gender to\nanother  after  already  establishing oneself, though changing careers within gender does not\nusually have much pushback.\n\nAlthough  not  many  issues  are  immediately  perceived  when  a  Naamyut  from Zyujyut\ninteracts  with  communities  from  other  cultures, issues tend to rise when the much more\nstrictly  upheld upper classes and nobility try to marry of a son or daughter and they do not\nhave  the  correct physical sex, causing the upper classes to have to resort to becoming a lot\npickier with who they choose to marry off.\n\nOverall,  the  lower  classes of Zyujyut society tend to be much looser with its strict gender\nroles,  especially  around  more  agricultural  related  jobs.  Typically  the  strictness  of its\nenforcement  on  the  lower  classes  depends on the family one comes from, otherwise it is\nsimply encouraged but not enforced by the traditions of the state.\n\nLikely due to these strict gender roles Zyujyut experiences a generally low birth rate."

They resemble small, wingless and humanoid\ndragons,  and  as  a  result  are  believed  to  be related to, or even created by, the dragons.\nThough widely considered weak and cowardly, kobolds' mechanical prowess is well-known\nthanks  to  their tendency to use cunning traps to protect themselves. This would eventually\nevolve  into their own form of artificer mastery, which would let them industrially rival that\nof the gnomes and goblins.\n\n==Physiology==\nThe  modern  authority  on  kobold  physiology  is  generally  considered to be Dr. Pakchi\nSteeltrap's\n''[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z54dPhv4YQmqj4qzfBBk44ogGQ_6Brls-HfwC6EWeY4/edit\nNotes  on  Racial  Phylogeny]'', the contents of whose kobold section are summarized here\nand the following sections.\n\nKobolds  stand roughly three to four feet tall on average, the smallest of any sapient rest on\nHalann,   tending   (partly  because  of  their  typically  hardscrabble,  impoverished  lives)\ntowards  slight  and  wiry  builds. Whereas most races have smooth skin, kobolds - as with\ntheir  draconic  relations  -  have  scaled  skin,  which primarily comes in three colors; red,\nblue, and green. A fourth subgroup in Haless has been reported sporting gold scales. These\nscales  (and  their  hide  in  general)  are  very  tough for their size; kobolds' reputation for\nfragility  is  more  due  to  their  small  size  and slight builds. As such, kobolds are widely\nconsidered  to  be sneaky and dexterous rather than direct combatants, preferring ambushes\nand traps to fight their enemies.\n\nKobolds  share many other features with dragons, such as the general shape of the head, the\neye, and the limbs, though they lack wings and are bipedal. They do possess a tail, which is\nused for balance and cannot be regrown if removed; the tail and limb shapes allow kobolds\nto  be  excellent  swimmers,  which  is  abnormal  for  a  subterranean  race, especially one\ntypically  regarded  as poor sailors (though this is due more to outside factors than inherent\ninability).  Many  of  their  physical  features  are very different from that of other reptiles,\nhowever,  such  as their respiratory and digestive systems. This is partially why kobolds are\nconsidered  (as  of 1905, at least) to have been created by the dragons rather than naturally\nevolved, though many details are unclear."

Eggs take approximately two weeks to gestate and then another two to three months to\nhatch  after  laying.  Even  considering  that  kobolds  typically wait for eggs to hatch before\ntrying  for  another  due to the physical stress of childbirth, this gives them a potential birth\nrates  of  four  to  five  children  per  mother  per  year,  which is among the highest known\nfecundity  rates for sapient species. Kobolds also mature quickly, reaching full physical size\nby  age 10 to 12, though kobolds do not consider their children to be adults until age 15 at\nthe  earliest.  Despite  this, kobolds' maximum average modern lifespan is very long, in the\nneighborhood of 120 years; this was almost never reached in the pre-Modern era, however,\nwith an expected maximum average of around half that.\n\n==History==\nThe  specific  timeline  of  kobolds  is  complicated  and difficult to distinguish in a simple\nmodern  form  due  to their subterranean tendencies for most of history in tandem with the\nseparate  appearance  of  the  Halessi  Goldscale Kobolds from the Dragon Coast kobolds.\nParticularly, kobolds are often considered having first appeared during the Dragonwake but\nthere  is credible sources dating the first Goldscale appearance in Yanshen as a result of the\nDay  of  Ashen Skies. Even further than that, multiple Yan myths and superstitions speak of\nlone  creature  who  greatly  resembled Goldscale Kobolds, myths whose origins trace back\nmuch  further than the DOAS. In addition to this, there is a question of how the Goldscale\nKobolds  can originate nearly 500 years before the Dragon Coast kobolds, and on the other\nside of Halcann, yet can interbreed and share the same physiology.\n\nIt  is  known  too,  that  the  Dragon  Coast kobolds had a subterranean society regarded as\n"prehistoric"  culture,  as  they  had  no written traditions of recording history, dating back\nfurther  than  we  might  think.  Ultimately  these  kobolds were brought out to the surface\nworld  during  the  Dragonwake  by  Tayekan  the  Blue.  This event, known as the Kobold\nUprising,  lead  to  the  destruction  of  the  First  Gnomish Hierarchy and the centuries of\ndevastation  following  (though  this  would  not  be  recorded  by kobolds who still lacked\nwritten traditions and whose oral traditions had been disrupted by the chaos)."

At\nsome  point  the  Great  Kobold Migration traversed into the Serpentspine and would form\nwhat  was  known  as  the  Darkscales.

Much of this is likely attributed to their\ngood  relations  with  the rest of Yanshen, and the Yan adoration for kobolds, in addition to\nthe general Yan dislike for followers of the Lefthand Path (whose land they've annexed).\n\n=== Draconic Origin Theory ===\nIn  regards  to  the  theory  of Kobold's origins at the hands of dragons, numerous pieces of\nevidence,  which  will  be  discussed, have come to light. Within physiology alone, dragons\nare  frequently  depicted (particularly Balris) with the very same barbels that kobolds have.\nSome  say  these are biased but it seems unlikely given the general negative attitude towards\nKobolds   throughout   Cannorian   history   and  the  depiction  of  dragons  with  such  in\nDragonwake  artifacts.  Furthermore,  the  draconic  resemblance  of kobolds to dragons is\nundeniable,  given  the  reduction  of  a  dragon's  wings,  shrinking  it, and given a bipedal\nframe.  In  addition, when looking at kobold culture there seems to be an intrinsic bond or\nattraction  between  them  towards  dragons.  Of course, much of this evidence is harder to\nfactually  and modernly identify due to the lack of dragon specimens to analyze and dissect.\nAlthough  specific  creators  are  unclear,  Balris the Gold is commonly accredited with the\ncreation  of  the  Haless  Goldscales  (with higher physical similarity than elsewhere), even\nhaving  been  directly  involved  in  the early development of Goldscale society of Balrijin.\nTayekan  the  Blue  is  proximally  connected to the creation of Dragon Coast kobolds, and\nthough  a  strain,  Dragon  Coast  kobolds  do have blue scales. In regards to the red/green\nscales, it is potential of Nimrith and Iothoral but little evidence supports this."

 page_events.2392.d: "\n\n== Sociology ==\n\n=== Name Scheme ===\n\n*  Given Name - "Great Name" (ancestor) - Zendia Name - Trivu Name - "Great Name"\n(other)\n\nA kobold's Tribu name is usually used as a conventional surname due to having the highest\nrelevance  with  outside  groups,  within  the  Trivu, the Zendia name takes precedence as a\n"conventional"  surname  instead.  Kobolds  with  only name have resulted from abnormal\nsituations,  such  as  being  abandoned,  exiled,  or having their social units destroyed. The\nmost   prominent   historical   example   is  Zurzumex,  who  self-exiled  himself  with  his\nfollowers. Later on surnames expanded to include locations as Trivu became less important\nand turned into other parts of society. Ultimately, type depends on the individual. Kobolds\ninto   elvenized   Cannorian   culture   may   use   ''zil''   or   ''zil  na''  after  ''sil/sil  na'';\ngnome-connected  ones  may use the Gnomish ''fen'' or ''fer''. The fourth part of a kobold\nname  can  go  after  Given  Name  or  usually at the end, such as honorifics, titles, famous\nancestors,  locational,  etc.  This  is colloquially known as "great name" due to often being\nthe most important.\n\n=== Social Life ===\nKobolds  are  ''extremely  social creatures'', to the degree it is hard to properly stress. This\nleads  to  many  kobolds  gaining  follower  syndrome,  or becoming self-sacrificing. While\nkobolds  are  not  without  sense  of  self,  they  are  often more concerned with the greater\nwhole.  Wealth  it tracked and handled at clan level, with kobolds traditionally having very\nlittle  in  the  way  of  private  or  personal property due to social situation. This extends to\nhaving  very  little  sense  of  privacy or personal space due to living lives with very little of\neither  (perhaps  in  part  leading  to  why  they clash with many other societies throughout\nHalcann history). At some point though there was noted a significant rise in kobold's sense\nof  individuality  and  self  as  seen  in  Zurzumexia.  They  began  to  focus  on  quality  of\nlife/prosperity/availability of space."
 page_events.2393.t: "Kobold 5 / 5"
 page_events.2393.d: "\n\n=== Gender Roles ===\nDue to a total lack of visible or physical sexual dimorphism and gender differences, kobold\nsocieties  seem  to  care  very little about the difference between genders and sexes. Gender\nroles  in  terms  of  social  and  occupational  are  almost  nonexistent  as jobs are typically\narranged  by  need  of  the  greater  whole  (playing  in  their  social tendencies). There are\nexceptions  in  terms  of property and governance, property being tracked maternally due to\nthe  ease  of  tracking  mothers. Governance itself is also traditionally a male job, though it\nshould  be  noted  a  chief/group  leader  can  be  removed  by  collective action of socially\nimportant/respected females.\n\n=== Culture ===\nKobolds,  as  mentioned before, have a distinctly social culture. Thriving in social settings,\nkobolds  removed  from  group social situations can become followers, but many tend to in\nfact  over-exert  individuality.  These  kobolds take on larger-than-life personalities such as\nexplorer  Salvador  sil Hotzaya, monk Rak Six Points, and artificer Zurzumex. In regards to\nothers,  kobolds  are often sensitive about their height, general social stature, and maturity.\nIt  is  common  in  Yanshen  that  they  are  seen  as  pets  or  children, to the dismay of the\nGoldscale  kobolds.  They  seem  to  share  a  collective  dislike  for  being seen as joke or\nchildren.\n\n=== Hoarding ===\nThe  kobold  hoarding  tendency  is  a  unique  instinctual mechanism that attracts them to\nshiny/valuable  objects,  subjectively  valued  by each individual kobold, given to collecting\nfor their own sake. In other societies this tends to combine poorly with their loose sense of\npersonal  property,  branding  them  as  chronic thieves in combination with their "sneaky"\ntendencies  and  build.  Some claim that the hoarding is actually to communal benefit, as it\nis  a  means of tracking property by clan and signifies their strength. Individual hoarding by\nkobolds  can  lead  to  complications  such  as  adverse  effects  on  individual  psychology,\ncreating  dragon-like  obsession  and  greeds.  Recently  these  skills  have  actually  led  to\nbroader  acceptance  in  the  world  as  conscript  armies  become  more commonplace the\nkobold's expertise to handle things en masse, especially money and people, become crucial\nskills."

 page_events.860.d: "\nThe  Konungdómr  of  Bjarnrík  is  a  country  located  in the Dalr Valley of Gerudia. It is\nknown  for  being  the  first  kingdom  in  Gerudia,  and  only  loosely  holds  the  clans of\nRevrhavn  and  Sidaett  under its leadership. It is known for its wars against Obrtrol, which\nwas  a  nation  of  Trolls  further  north. Bjarnrík is the most receptive of the Gerudians to\nscientific and cultural advancements from the rest of Cannor.\n\n==History==\n\n=== Pre-History BA ( Until 0 AA ) ===\nGerud's  Realm,  the  dominion of the Frost Giants, once covered the Dalr Valley until the\nend  of  the  Age of Giants around 12,000 BA. Only Frost Giants and Frost Trolls dwelled\nin  these  glaciated  lands,  building  the  city  that would become Murtrhol in the Dalrfjall\nMountains.  Their  tyranny  ended with dragonfire melting their halls and hearts, with their\nflooding creating the aptly-named Giant's Grave Sea.\n\nFollowing  the  flooding  of  the Giant's Grave Sea, the population of Frost Giants steadily\ndecreased  throughout  the  centuries.  However, the Trolls became ever more numerous in\nthe  realm,  becoming  the  true protectors of the Gerud's Realm. Some claim that humans\nonce  dwelt  in  these  lands  as  subjects  of the Frost Giants, known as Olav's Children to\nSkaldskolan  scholars.  Such  claims  are  only  proposed  due  to some particularly ancient\nEbonsteel   artifacts   being   sized  for  use  by  humans.  What  is  certain  is  that  human\noccupation of Gerudia was present following the thawing and flooding of the Giant's Grave\nSea. While the earliest human settlement of Gerudia can be traced back to Urviksten, they\nsoon  began  to  occupy  the  rest  of  Olavlund  and  the  Dalr  Valley.  The  Frost  Giants\nthemselves  became  reclusive,  leaving their lands to be watched by their loyal Trolls - and\ntaken by opportunistic humans.\n\nFor  ages  the  Frost  Trolls  were  thought  to  have  been gone, until Jormir Once-Thawed\nbrought  back the dominion of the Frost Giants over Gerudia in 570 BA. Jormir united the\nland  and  was  feared  by the Castanor of old, but was known for a peaceful reign from his\nicy  palaces  in Far Gerudia. However, in 407 BA Jormir was slain by his brother Kranmas\nwho  waged war against Castanor in the Wars of the Giantsbane until his defeat in 357 BA.\nKranmas  even  fielded  Gerudian  warriors against the southerners, be it from awe or fear.\nBy  373  BA  the  Castanorian  Legions  had  began  to  counter-attack  into  Gerudia,  and\nexterminated many of the Frost Giants and their Trolls. Kranmas himself was the last Frost\nGiant, now known as Kranmas the Enchained, forced to rebuild the ruined fortifications of\nBal Vroren."

This began the age of the Ebonsteel Kings, marked\nby the large amount of Ebonsteel weapons and armor forged. Despite the animosity of their\nwars  and  occupation,  the kindred between the human civilizations fostered trade between\ntheir  lands.  Until  the  Day of Ashen Skies, humans steadily began to claim Gerudia from\nthe  Frost  Trolls.  The  settlements  of  the Dalr Valley followed the Rafn river northward,\nestablishing  towns as far as Silfrhof and Algrar. However, most of the Gerudians remained\nby  the  Giant's  Grave Sea where they plied the seas for sustenance, trade, and increasingly\nraiding.\n\nThe  Day  of  Ashen  Skies  saw less apocalyptic destruction in Gerudia as compared to the\nrest of the world, but is recorded by Gerudians as being the bloodiest attack by Trolls since\nthe  reign  of  the  Frost Giants.

Burial  mounds and sprawling cairns were constructed for the greatest of\nheroes,  with  the largest collection at Haugrmyrr.

It is made of magic-forged\nsteel  with  a  nugget  of  damestear  as  a power source, and at the tip of the drill is a sharp\npoint  of  Black  Damestear,  or  Korashi as its known to the Halessi. Invented by gnomish\nartificers  of  the  Gommo,  the drill went through various versions until the Mk 5. DOLG\n(meaning Dagger) Korashi Drill first was able to penetrate a Temple's Heart.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Drill Invention ===\nAfter  arriving  in  Haless in 1580, the Gommo wouldn't get access to Korashi until 1617,\nafter  the  Command's  failure  to take Tianlou. Purchasing siege equipment and loot from\nthe  battlefield,  including  mage  collars,  the  Gommo  would  begin their experiments on\nKorashi  back  in  their  headquarters  in  Cannor  and  through independent researchers in\nYanshen.  One  such  researcher  would  eventually publish a paper on High Temple wards,\nwith  the  Gommo's seal of approval. Nearly fifty years of experimentation, trial and error,\nand  strange  inventions  would  culminate  in  the  first  Korashi Drill built by the recently\nestablished  Tianlou office (founded in 1667 under Command jurisdiction). This first drill\nwas  limited  by  several  aspects.  First,  being an early model, the drill was inefficient and\nweak.  Second, although the Command had been selling korashi to the Gommo they would\nbe  kicked  out  in  1678,  causing  both  Tianlou  drill workers and researchers to move to\nFeiten  (losing  papers  along  the  way)  and  limiting  their access to the vital resource. To\novercome these aspects, the drill was excessively large with only the smallest part made out\nof Korashi to make up for their lack of supply.\n\n=== Testing ===\nAs  testing of the drills, led by Owen Kayman, continued on magical equipment resulting in\nthe  Mk  5  in 1697. The first temple originally planned to be tested was Tianlou, but with\nthe  poor  situation  of Command-Gommo relations it was ultimately decided that it would\nbe  best to go elsewhere. Arriving at Feiten, the office there was eager to test the device and\nprovided transportation to the nearby major temple of Luoyip."

Transporting the drill through\nthe  hills  and  jungle between it and Luoyip was treacherous, especially in tandem with the\noccasional  act  of  sabotage by locals. Ultimately, the Mk 5 arrived at the Temple complex\nin  1701,  undamaged,  with  a team of gnomish archeologists in tow. The drill pierced the\nTemple  door  with  relative  ease,  shattering  the  warding  that  was  thought  to be nearly\nimpenetrable.  With the warding broken, two major complications arose preventing further\nprogress.  For one, the inner Temple Complex was still littered with traps and dangers that\nrequired  the  skill of adventurers to surmount. Two, even when they did reach the heart of\nthe  temple, it was found to be significantly difficult to bring the large, clunky drill through\nthe  narrow  passageways  to  destroy  its  wardings.  Although  this  was  done with time in\nLuoyip,  it  was considered inefficient and a waste of resources until a smaller model could\nbe invented.\n\n=== Further Improvements ===\nWith  this  task  in  mind,  the  Gommo  division  responsible  for inventing the Mk 5 was\nprovided  funding  and patents to further their research and production. With the bloodless\ncoup  of  Tianlou  in 1705 came limitless opportunity for the Gommo, having made a deal\nfor  an  independent  office in Tianlou in exchange for their support against the Command,\nthe  Gommo's  influence  in  the  newly freed states of Yanshen began to grow rapidly. The\nTianlou  office  would  only  be  official reestablished in 1720, though work had continued\nboth there and in the Feiten office allowing the first handheld drill to be invented in 1721.\n\n=== Effects ===\nBy  the  beginning  of  the  Rending, adventurers such as Indiboddo Jonesonn had handheld\nversion  that  allowed  them  to  simultaneously  break  through  the  Temple's warding and\nexplore  it  with  relative  ease, The proliferation of the drill and its decreasing size allowed\nfor  more  widespread usage to raid Temples, contributing to the plundering that took place\nthrough  the  early  mid-late  1700s.  This  and  the  Oni's  corruption  of the Temples are\nconsidered the primary causes of the Rending."

Despite being\nhostile  to  Castanorian influence in the past, the new kingdom quickly took to Castanorian\ncustoms  and  government  and  established a powerful military presence in the north and a\nstrong   economical  one  in  its  southern  coasts,  trading  with  the  likes  of  Bulwar  and\nKheterata.  In  547,  fearing the increasingly powerful Wexonards, the Korbarids became a\nclient state of Late Castan's Empire in which the area flourished greatly.\n\n===Daravan's Folly===\nIn  666  the  gnolls  of Sarhal reformed into the Second Xhaz and the Invasion of the Third\nXhaz promptly arrived in Cannor, in which the Korbarids faced the brunt of their invasion.\nDespite being with forces from Castanor, the eternal bane of gnolls, the coalition still faced\nmajor  defeats  and  many  gnoll  warpacks  managed  to  pass  through  Corvuria  and sack\nCannor interior.\n\nIn  what  is  known  today  as  the  Battle of Daravan's Folly the Korbard king Daravan the\nMalignant  performed  a  dark  ritual  and  flooded the entire southern coast of Corvuria in\norder  to  kill  the  gnollish  host  and  prevent  further  invasions,  as well as the retreating\ncoalition  forces  consisting  of  his  own  men  and  Castanor's,  including the Castanorian\nEmperor Castan Oldways.\n\nUnbeknownst  to  Daravan,  his dark spell, combined with the newly flooded coast and the\ngreat  loss  of  life  created  the inhospitable cursed swamp known today as Daravan's Folly\nwhich  over time would gradually increase in size spreading further into mainland Corvuria\n- destroying the economical southern region of the kingdom and forcing a massive influx of\nrefugees  north  to  the  Vertbern  Basin.  By  1444  most  of  Corvuria is consumed by the\nswamps.\n\n===Castanorian Rule===\nIn  672,  in retaliation for Daravan's Folly, Castanor invaded formally ending the Korbarid\nKingdom,  with  its  people becoming subjects of the Empire. Unlike the past in which the\nKorbarids   enjoyed   relative   rights  within  Castanor  this  time  round  they  became  an\noppressed   people,   with  the  much  of  the  Korbarid  culture  being  assimilated  in  the\nCastanorian  one  -  leading  to  the  Castanized name of ''Corvurian''. Along with this the\nKorbarid Dragon Cult was demonized and forced underground."

 page_events.866.d: "\nKrummul  Orcslayer  was  a  Titanium Dwarf from Gor Vazumbrog who was renowned for\njoining  the  Dauvek  Veker  at  the  young  dwarven age of 23 and slaying a nest of Ancient\nDeep  Crows  and later becoming the High Elder of the Dauvek Veker . He is now revered\nas one of the great ancestors of Dwarven Ancestor Worship.\n\n==Early Life==\nKrummul  Orcslayer  was  born  in  2804  BA  in  Gor  Vazumbrog during the Segbandalic\nGolden  Age.  At  age  23,  he  joined  the Dauvek Veker which was unprecedented for any\nDwarf  before  him  and  for  years  after. As proof of mettle and worth of entry, he slew an\nentire nest of Ancient Deep Crows, returning with their feathers and heads as proof.\n\n==Feats as High Elder==\nAs  Krummul  proved  himself  in battle against the orcs and other monsters throughout his\nlife,  he  was promoted to High Elder of the Dauvek Veker, which was the highest rank. In\n2681  BA,  disaster  struck  at  the  reclaimed Hul-Jorkad when a rich and powerful orcish\nwarhost arrived and breached the hold in a bloody frenzy, looking for their lost god, in turn\nreverting the progress of the Segbandalic Expeditions.\nIt  was  only  by  a  miracle in the defender’s favour that the Titanium Dwarves managed to\nretreat,  with  the  arrival of the famed Krummul Orcslayer and a 500 strong warhost of the\nDauvek  Veker’s  finest.  Brandishing  his personal two-handed greatsword “Setzunklufa” or\n''Skycleaver'', a relic crafted by his own hands from the bone of some beast he had slain in\nthe  depths  of the Serpentspine, he himself slaughtered a hundred score orcs before the day\nwas done and the last living Titanium Dwarf was evacuated from Hul-Jorkad.\n\n==Krummul's Vow to the Surani==\nIn  2672  BA,  it  was  by  missive  of the God-King, Mušargil the Gardener of Men of the\nSurani  city  state  that would one day become Eduz-Vacyn, that the Dwarves became aware\nof  the  actions  of  the  Orcish  Warhost.  The  God-King,  though  technically  capable of\ndestroying  the  host  on  their  own,  had  encountered  an  issue  that plagued many of his\ncontemporaries,  manpower.  Whilst  they could have used their bound Djinn and wish the\nhost  destroyed,  it  would  have opened himself to an attack by his rivals, who had directed\nthe  host  to  his  lands with bribes and trinkets. Consulting his advisors, one stated that he\nhad  heard  a  tale  that  the  “Stone-carvers” that inhabit the mountains and trade from the\n“Great  Harbour”  upstream  of  the Suran have been rumoured to struggle with nightmares\nfrom  the  bones  of the earth. Weary of wasting power that would risk leaving him open to\nhis  rivals,  he sent his finest warriors to request their aid in destroying the ones that plague\nhis realm."

They met with Mušargil, and though most of the details of the exchange are lost to\nthis  day,  at least one passage from Krummul Orcslayer’s speech has survived intact.''“I am\nKrummul,  Son  of  Vlondir.  To  you,  Mušargil,  this day, I and these 16,000 souls of the\nSegbandal  who  follow  me  swear to not leave this sandblasted realm until every last orc is\nslain.  Until  their  filth  no  longer taints the lands you call your gardens. We swear under\nOath  to  Halanna  and our Ancestors, upon Dagrin and his Beard, upon Hehogrim and his\nmastery  of  every  Craft  known  to Dwarvenkind, and ancestors new and old, that we shall\nfight  alongside  your  soldiers,  clad  as  they  are in bone and copper. We shall teach your\npeople  to  craft  this into a harder metal, one that will not bend nor break as easily against\nthe black metal of the orcs.''\n\n''This  we  give  to  you  as  penance  for  our  failure  to  contain  them.  In return, we ask\npermission  to cross your realm and do battle together against them. In show of friendship,\nwe  shall  teach  your  people  to  hew  the  stone  with  the  tools they shall make with our\npenance.  In return, we ask yours and ours to break bread and beer together, as equals. For\nonly  as  equals,  can  the  orcs be defeated. Only together, only united, can this menace be\nstopped. I say this to you as Krummul, Son of Vlondir, also known as Orcslayer. This truth\nevery  dwarven  soul here swears.”''The orcish warhost was destroyed, wiped from the land\nwithin  the  next  three  months.  The  humans  fought alongside the dwarves as equals, and\nthough  it  was not without struggle, the two races found victory. This further brought fame\nto Krummul and the Dauvek Veker as he achieved such a great victory.\n\n== Death of the Orcslayer==\nThe  life  of  Krummul  Orcslayer  ended  not  with  bloodshed  or  broken  bones,  but the\nfeebleness  of  old  age.  He did not see the end of his 263rd year of life. Already venerable\nby  dwarf  standards,  the  last  30  years  of his life had been spent in retirement, where he\ncodified  a  series  of  texts  of  knowledge that would become a veritable holy book for the\nDauvek  Veker  and  many dwarves beyond. He died surrounded by friends and family, one\nof the few Dauvek Veker to ever do so, before and since."

They dress mostly in\nhides  or  furs  and  tattoo  the skin of their warrior elite and honored elders with pigments\nderived  from  the  crimson  sap  of  the  trees  that give these lands, the Bloodgroves, their\nname.\n\n==Culture==\nMost  of  the  Kwineh  live  in semi-permanent settlements along the Sella river, practicing\nlow-intensity  agriculture  of  crops  such as maize, squash, and tobacco. Councils of elders\nelect chiefs from within their ranks to deal with diplomatic and military matters while most\nday-to-day  political affairs are handled by the council.

The  Kwineh  have  a practice where a warrior stays behind to draw the\nBloodfeeders on him so the tribe can escape and isn't forced into a large battle with them.\n\n==Religion==\nIt  is  the  relationship  between  the  Kwineh and the forest lands they call home that most\ndefines their religious beliefs. Kwineh religion centers around the worship of The Weeping\nMother, a deific personification of the Bloodgroves, and they believe that the forest itself is\na  sacred  being  to be honored and protected – the bloody color of the tree’s sap and leaves\nduring  autumn  and  winter  is  thought  to  be  the  blood of the countless individuals who\nperished  in  “The  Great Dying” millennia ago, for whom the Forest Mother still mourns.\nDespite  her  eternal  mourning,  she  nourishes those who respect her beneficence but will\nwithhold  the  bounty of nature from the disrespectful – thus the Kwineh are very particular\nabout consumption of natural resources, taking no more than needed and offering thanks to\nthe Weeping Mother for each gift she imparts."

 page_events.871.d: "\nThe  Lake  Federation is a federation comprising the numerous political states that exist on\nthe  Triunic  Lakes.  The  population  consists  of  three  cultural groups, the Zabatlari, the\nMetsamic,  and  the  Khamgunai,  with  each originally split following three religions, each\nrepresenting  one  of  the  lakes and each corresponding to one of the people groups, Yukel,\nKodave,  and  Enuuk  respectively.  Later,  Kalyin  Worship,  a unification of all three lake\ngoddesses, would prevail as the sole religion of the Lake Federation. Starting as a loose and\ndecentralised  coalition  of  numerous states, it eventually grew into a united political entity\nin 1625. The Capital of the Lake Federation is located in the city of Qarshtuluu.\n\n== The Foundation of the Lake Federation ==\nThe  Foundation of the Lake Federation can be definitely dated to 1441 AA, being the first\npolitical  entity  to  encompass  the entirety of the Triunic Lakes. Originally formed to end\ninternal  infighting,  unite  the disparate Triunic peoples, and unify the dozens of individual\nstates  that  emerged  after  the  wake  of  The  Great  Incursion  a  year  prior  and  ensure\nsomething   like   it  would  never  happen  again.  There  was  also  a  great  emphasis  on\nsafeguarding  independence and democracy, as the entirety of the federation agreed to never\nallow another “Tyrant Queen” to emerge again.\n\nFormer  political  predecessors  to the Federation, such as The Amberpact, were attempted\nin  the  past, however each attempted iteration failed to achieve the same political, military,\nand economic unification as the Lake Federation.\n\nThe Ratification of the treaty declaring the foundation of the Lake Federation was signed in\nHaraigizenhi  Bulrek  in  1441,  a  city  historically  known  for  hosting many treaties and\ndiplomatic compromises, as well as being home to Haraigh.\n\n== The Era of Crises ==\nThe  period  from  1441  to  1625  is known to the Triunic Peoples as the “Era of Crises,”\naptly  named  for  its  numerous political crises that threatened the unity of the Federation,\nand  on  numerous  occasions  led  to  widespread  infighting  and violence. Alongside this,\nnumerous  centaur  invasions and wars on the borders of the Federation occurred alongside\nthese  crises,  as  roaming  centaur  hordes  took  advantage  of  the  federation’s instability.\nDuring  this  period  however  the  organizational  structure  of  the Lake Federation would\ngradually stabilize and begin to become more unified."
 page_events.2402.t: "Lake Federation 2 / 8"

Followers  of  Kodave  would  then  demand  an  official apology and\ncompensation for this incident, which was then refuted by followers of Enuuk, who claimed\nthe  deal  was  legitimate  and  fair.  This would prompt the followers of Yukel to intervene\nbetween  the  two  goddesses, seeking to mitigate any potential conflict. however this would\nfail,  and  war  would  break  out  across  the  Lake  Federation  3 years later in 1452. The\nconclusion  of  this  crisis  would  result in the victory of the followers of Kodave over both\nEnuuk  and  Yukel  in 1458, strengthening Kodave influence and sewing division within the\nTriunic peoples.\n\n=== The Rebellion of Frosted Glass ===\nThe  Republic  of  Vahjevgiiv,  for  centuries  seen as an expansionist state by its neighbors,\nconquered  the eastern half of the city of Qarshtuluu, in 1465, having been given control of\nhalf  of it following the Great Incursion under the promise they would rebuild and renovate\nthe city using their own coffers, would once again invade and take the entire city, with them\npreviously  conquering  it in 1427 AA. Unlike the previous wars however, in 1470 the city\nof  Qarshtuluu,  now united again under their neighbor revolted. The political and military\nresponse was overwhelming, with a new Ghuvkeshevdel being formed, with the first formed\nto  oppose Vahjevgiiv and Länkuuhsta during the prior’s first wars of expansion, and several\nmore  being  formed  throughout  the  years.  Supplies  and  support from nearly the entire\nfederation  poured  to  the  rebellion’s cause, and following 4 years of rebellion and aid, the\nCity  of  Qarshtuluu  would  ultimately  gain  independence,  with the moment signifying a\nturning  point in the Federation’s history, as the right to self-determination would become a\ncore  value  in  many  peoples’  minds.  Contemporary Triunic historians conclude that the\nRebellion  of  Frosted Glass would largely diminish Vahjevgiiv expansionism, as no serious\nattempts at expansion were ever attempted following this.\n"
 page_events.2403.t: "Lake Federation 3 / 8"
 page_events.2403.d: "\n=== The Ultakal Crisis ===\nThe  Ultakal  Crisis occurred in 1490 between the states of Khugatseig and Tzidoilhol over\nownership  of  the  island  of  Ultakal,  the sole gold-producing mine in all of the Lakes, as\nwell  as  home  to  the  grand  mints which produced almost the entirety of the Federation’s\ncoinage,  when  Khugatseig  refused  to  cede  the  island,  to  Tzidoihol  as per the Ultakal\nAgreement,  which  since 473 AA stipulated they were to hand over the island to each other\nevery  5  years.  A  year  later  Tzidoihol  requested  Federation  intervention in the matter,\ncausing  the  cities  to  divide  into  factions regarding who to support, with each of the two\nsisters maneuvering and offering concessions to other states for support. Both parties would\nuse  loans,  bribes,  blackmail,  and  many  other  forms  of diplomatic leverage in order to\ngarner  support  for  their own faction. In the midst of this, a minority debate if Federation\nintervention is even appropriate, as some considered it to be a “domestic” affair, unfit to be\nappealed  to the multinational structure of the Federation. In 1495, as the two parties were\non  the  brink  of  war, Kovtalzar, the president of the Federation at the time, intervened in\nthe conflict in support of Tzidoihol. This would outrage supporters of Khugatseig, however\nultimately  few  consider  the  matter  worth  going to an escalated war over. A year later in\n1496,  Khugatseig is made to compensate Tzidoihol however the wealth primarily goes into\npaying back all of their supporters, thus rendering neither party a significant advantage over\nthe  other  in  the  long  run. While the crisis undoubtedly caused a great degree of friction\nbetween  the two parties, as well as between their supporters, the end result caused many to\nbegin  reconsidering  and reflecting on the potential consequences of further division within\nthe Federation.\n\n=== The Revalation of Kalyin ===\nThe  Revalation  of  Kalyin  occurred  when  in 1525, a prophet claimed to see the truth of\nunity  that was Kalyin. This would immediately cause widespread and sudden debate across\nthe  federation.  In  1534,  the  city  of Raattakod became the first city to formally worship\nKalyin,  further  expanding  the  debate  as it gained political and religious legitimacy. This\nwould  lead  to the rise of the reactionary party known as Individualists, those who believed\nin  three  separate  goddesses,  to  attempt  to  challenge  the  growing  influence  of Kalyin\nWorship  in  the  Federation.  In  1540,  the  first  sparks of conflict would erupt when the\nTemple   of   Kodave   was   rededicated   to   Kalyin,   causing   massive   outrage  among\nIndividualists, especially Kodave Followers. By 1542, a slight majority of the total cities in\nthe  Federation  officially worshipped Kalyin, which prompted the Individualists factions to\ndeclare  war  in  fears  they  would  eventually be completely supplanted of all political and\nreligious  authority.  5  years  later  in  1547,  Kalyin  Worship  would triumph as all cities\nwould  formally  adopt  Kalyin Worship, however the actual spread of worship to the wider\npopulation  would  happen  at  a  much  slower  pace,  with it being almost non-existent on\nmainland colonies."

 page_events.2404.d: "\n\nUltimately  Kalyin Worship would prevail as the sole de facto, and later dejure, faith of the\nFederation.  This  was the first crisis to truly push the idea of unification to the forefront of\nTriunic  politics,  as  the  worship  of Kalyin symbolized a religious unification of the three\ntriunic  peoples,  as  well  as  the  three  lakes. Contemporary analysis of the rise of Kalyin\nWorship  has  noted  the belief that all gods are simply splinters of Kalyin, with each of the\nthree  goddesses being merely “faces” of Kalyin. The rise of Kalyin as the sole unified deity\nof  the  Lakes,  and  the  view  of  many  Triunic  peoples  who saw her as “gaining her full\nstrength”,  greatly  coincided  with  the  increasingly  political  and  practical  need  for  the\nsolidification  of the Lake Federation as a true political entity among prominent politicians\nand diplomats across the Federation.\n\n=== The Seiche ===\nThe  unprecedented Tsunami or Seiche that struck the Northern Westmarches and Western\nHeartlands  in 1559 was unique in that it is widely regarded as a major unifying moment in\nthe  history  of  the  Federation.  Modern  historians  theorize it was the result of a massive\nmeteor  impact  in  the  Blue  Sea, as records and observations have proven that Kukatodic\ncoasts  and  populations  were  also affected by the Seiche. The Seiche would hit numerous\ncities, however none were hit as worse as Sinesadma, which suffered the most out of all the\ncities,  and  was almost entirely destroyed. The Seiche caused widespread devastation, with\nthe  resulting fallout causing tens of thousands of deaths, and causing over a million people\nto  be  displaced  due  to  the  catastrophic  flooding.  The  widespread  and indiscriminate\ndestruction  wrought  by  the  tsunami would lead to a federation wide relief and aid effort,\nwith  every  member  state  supporting  those  hit  by  the  tsunami.  In  the  wake  of  this,\nreconstruction  and  rebuilding  efforts  would  last  decades  beginning  from  1562, which\nwould  help  to allow those displaced to return to their homes safely, although the Rainbow\nHarbour  would  take  a  further  decade  to  rebuild.  While  the  rebuilding  process  was\nrelatively  quick  from  a  humanitarian  perspective,  the emotional and political impact of\nstates  who previously fought against each other helping each other in their moment of need\nsolidified and deepened the growing sense of unity within the federation."

 page_events.2405.d: "\n\n=== Arcane Ponderance ===\nFor  1500  years  the  Lake  Federation  has  held  a disdain and has actively discriminated\nagainst  mages,  following the Reign of the Tyrant Queen from 274 to 250 BA that resulted\nin  widespread  political  upheaval as numerous nobles across the lakes supported her rule.\nThe  Tyrant  Queen  would experiment on people whom she ordered kidnapped and would\nturn  them  into  monsters, with their souls sealed into homunculi. She was also known for\nconquering  neighboring  lands,  and  for  her  overall  madness  and  cruelty  as  her  reign\ncontinued.  The  Arcane  Ponderance, as agreed by numerous contemporary historians, was\nan  inevitable  confrontation of the past of the Lake Federation going into a new age, and as\nsuch  debate  was  widespread  across  the  lakes, and especially at the City of Narkel, built\nnear  the ancient City of Tyranny, which held the Federation’s only Magic Academy. Mages\nof the city would also take part in the fight during the Great Incursion, which both inspired\nand  worried  their  non-magical comrades. The debate began in 1572, with tensions being\nhigh  across  the  Federation  as  orators,  politicians,  diplomats, and mages and professors\nfrom  the  Magic  Academy would debate publicly. Ultimately, diplomacy would prevail as\nan organized committee was formed. Ultimately, following 4 years of debate and argument,\nthe  general  consensus  of  the  committee  was that Mages would once more be allowed to\ngather,  however the system of supervision established by Narkel, the Onyxguard, would be\nexpanded  across  the  Federation  in  order  to watch and ensure something like the Tyrant\nQueen  would  never  occur again. The victory of diplomacy during the Arcane Ponderance\nwas  to  many  a  triumph of the Federation’s desire to work together and put fighting aside,\nespecially in the wake of the Seiche.\n\n=== The Drafting of the Constitution ===\nThe  Drafting of the Constitution would begin in 1607, as the Republic of Yikashlay would\nbegin   drafting  their  idea  of  the  constitution,  with  their  primary  focus  being  on  the\nimportance  of  production,  as they were one of the main centers of artisanry, being mostly\nfree  from threats due to their city’s high position. Two years later in 1609, the Republic of\nZurkanrek  would  join  in the drafting, with their constitution’s primary focus being on the\nimportance  of trade, as they were the port from which the Treasure Fleet would depart and\nreturn  to.  In  1610,  Länkinä  would  also  join  in  the  drafting,  with their constitution’s\nprimary focus being on the importance of the military, as Länkinä was almost always on the\nfront  lines  from  Centaur  incursions,  due  to  the  ease of which ice bridges would allow\ncrossings  into  the  Lakes.  In  1612,  Qarshtuluu would take part in drafting as well, with\ntheir   constitution   maintaining  a  balanced  focus  between  production,  trade,  and  the\nmilitary. In 1620, the debate of the Constitution proper began, as cities began to take sides\nsupporting the draft they felt most represented them, however unlike previous debates there\nwas  never  a threat of war. Records show that previous drafts existed, however the drafts of\nYikashlay,  Zurkanrek, Länkinä, and Qarshtuluu were the only ones to gain popular support\noutside  of  their respective cities. 5 years of voting, debates, and concession later, in 1625,\nthe  Qarshtuluu  Constitution  was  finally  adopted  as  the  official  Constitution,  and the\nRepublic  of  Kalsyto  was  declared,  with the City itself being chosen as the new capital of\nthe united nation."

Numerous\ncelebrations,  parades,  and  parties  occurred  upon  the  day  of  unification, and for many\nmonths  afterwards,  and  the  date  of  unification  is  also  celebrated as a national holiday\nwithin Kalsyto.\n\nThe  unification  would  also  lead  to the institution of a nation-wide linguistic curriculum\nand  the  construction  of  dozens of language academies across the lakes, leading to a rapid\nrise  in citizens being able to speak all three of the main languages, with a slight majority of\ncitizens  living  in  urban  areas being trilingual by the year 1836. Hybrid words combining\nthe  three  languages  are  commonplace in Triunic society, and most modern vocabulary is\nintentionally  hybridized  to  foster  even  closer  cooperation  and  integration  of  all three\npeoples  as  one.  The  name  of the nation, Kalsyto, was itself a hybridized word, meaning\n"Federation   of   Kalyin,"   with   Kal   coming  from  Kalyin,  and  -syto  being  a  highly\ncompressed version of all three languages word for "federation."\n\nThe  next  200  years  would  see  the  steady  rise  of  Kalsyto as it peacefully developed to\nbecome one of the world's largest economies, and be seen to many as the defining center of\nhuman rights.\n\n== Kalsyto Colonies and the Orachav ==\nThe  bulk  of  the  Lake Federation’s Colonies began to develop in the early 1500s, prior to\nUnification,   however   upon  unification  and  the  formation  of  Kalsyto,  consolidation,\nunification,  and  administration  of  the  Lake Federation’s mainland colonies needed to be\nstreamlined  as  independent  colonization  processes had to be consolidated under the new\ncentral  government.  The  nearby lands of Nuzurbokh were of especially high value due to\nits  resources and having some arable land, as colonization primarily took the form of joint\nventures,  individuals  going  out  to claim land, and large numbers of towns being founded\nindependent  of  any  city.  Contrasting  against  the  highly  valuable and desirable lands of\nNuzurbokh, the lands of the Kukatodic peoples, which were much harder to settle, being of\nprimarily  taiga  and  not  being  nearly  as  resource  rich or conducive to farming. Several\ncolonies  still  did dot the Kukatodic coasts, however these were eventually absorbed in the\nGrombari  colonial administration, as Kalsyto did not see the lands as particularly valuable\nand not worth fighting a war over."

The reemergence of the Yudunyovi faith,\nwhich  the ancient Zabatlari held prior to being forced off the steppes by centaur invasions,\nwould  lead  to  further  separation  from  those  residing  on  the  islands,  as  they  hold a\ncompletely  different  pantheon of gods from Kalyin Worshippers. They were sponsored by\nthe Kalsyto Central Government to reclaim and govern the Forbidden Plains, primarily the\nSouth,  as  governing  over  the  entirety  of the open steppes was seen as both an extremely\ndifficult, and ultimately fruitless endeavor to many. The Orachav are nominal subjects who\nmaintain  a  great degree of autonomy, an example being their independent policies towards\ncentaurs, owing to their widely praised ability at guarding and protecting the frontier.\n\n== The Egdüqon ==\nThe  Egdüqon  or  Idyllic  Shield is the most recent period of Kalsyto history, with it being\nprimarily   defined  by  the  complete  isolation  of  Kalsyto  from  the  rest  of  the  world.\nAnti-monarchist  sentiment  had  long  been  a  shared value amongst all triunic peoples, in\nfear  of the rise of another “Tyrant Queen,” however first contact with the heavily absolutist\nEmpire  of  Grombar  would  prove  to be the first cause of concern amongst the nation, as\nGrombar  would prove to be their only point of contact with Cannor until Cannorian ships\narrived  in  the  Blue  Sea, trade and information exchange was under heavy supervision. In\nspite  of  this,  contacts  with  Cannor provided technological and institutional changes that\nwere  welcomed,  and  with  the  rise  in  republicanism  in the Empire of Anbennar, many\nhoped democracy might prevail in the Empire, just as it had in the Trollsbay.\n\nHowever,  the  failure  of  the  Blackpowder  Rebellion,  and  the  simultaneous rallying of\nmonarchs  and their forces across Cannor to seemingly crush republicanism and democracy\nin  its  entirety  sent  shockwaves  through  Kalsyto.  Many  feared that similar forces, both\ninternal  and external, may take advantage of the examples of the Blackpowder Rebellion to\nenact  a  similar  monarchist  revival  in the nation, and so with the widespread approval of\nmany leading politicians, the Egdüqon was enacted, to protect and maintain Triunic beliefs,\ncustoms, and especially Republicanism and Democracy."

For  much  of  their  history, the Lencori clashed with major imperial powers and\nsaw their people and territory conquered and divided by the Gnomish Hierarchy, Castanor,\nand the Damerian Republic.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe  name  Lencori  derives  from  the  Old Castanorian "people of the west" and was first\nmentioned during the reign of Castan Beastbane in the Early Castanorian Period.\n\nThe  Gnomish  Hierarchy,  which  had  dealt  with  the  Lencori  many  years prior, simply\nreferred to the Lencori as "taldouds" meaning "tall person" in Gnomish.\n\n==History==\n===Origins and the Hierarchy===\nThe  Lencori  were  never  a  unified  people and were split into countless tribes, clans and\nkingdoms  that  were  constantly warring amongst themselves and the halfling tribes to their\nnorth.\n\nDuring the rise of the Gnomish Hierarchy, the Lencori opposed the Hierarchy's expansion,\nbut  over time found that trade with the gnomes was more profitable with the establishment\nof  the  gnomish  colony  of Portnamm.

The  Lencori  were  initially  very  receptive,  adopting  Castanor's\ncustoms,  language  and even gods in the areas bordering these settlements.

 page_events.887.d: "\nStarting in the year 480 with the arrival of Gawedi invaders and the collapse of the Lencori\nEmpire,  the  Lencori  Warlord  Period  was  a  45  years  long  period  of  Lencori history\ncharacterized  by  the  lack  of established realms in Lencenor, as Lencori tribes, Damerian\nremnants and Gawedi Warlords fought for supremacy in the region.\n\nMigrating  south  in  fear  of  the  dragons  after  their  conquest of Vertesk, the path of the\nGawedi  down  the  eastern shores of the Dameshead was stopped first by the victory of the\nDamerian  Republic  and  its  new  vasalans  at  the  Battle of Bal Hyl and then by Nimrith\nhimself burning Damescrown to the ground while the Gawedi occupied it.\n\nWith  their  path  to  Esmaria apparently closed, the Gawedi wave turned to the southwest,\nwhere  the  Gnomish  Hierarchy had just collapsed after the Kobold Rising. With the Sack\nof  Beepeck  having  taken place in 474 already, they invaded the fractured Small Province,\nwhich  reacted by forming the Small Kingdom. Meanwhile, to the south the collapse of the\nDamerian  Republic had led to the formation of the Lencori Empire, a Damerian successor\nstate  led  by  Daromas,  the former Lenco-Damerian governor of Damerian Lencenor who\nhad  mostly  united  the  land  after  the  First  Daromasian  War.  The  start of the Second\nDaromasian  War in the year 479 saw Daromas move troops from the old borders with the\nGnomish  Hierarchy  to  the  core  of  his empire in order to fight the rebellion, and so the\nRubenti  tribe from the north fleeing the Gawedi invasion could cross into the center of the\nregion  with little opposition. They settled the land along the Bloodwine River, and shortly\nafter  the  Gawedi  invaders  found  lands  ripe  for  the  taking  as  they  invaded  northern\nLencenor with little opposition.\n\nBy the end of the Second Daromasian War the Lencori Empire was no more: the capital of\nDaromath  was  taken by the new Gawedi Kingdom of Daromand the Lencori Warlord Era\nbegan,  with  Lencori  and  Gawedi  warlords  fighting for dominance in the region as some\nDamerian  remnants fell and others consolidated into realms like the Tretunic Kingdom or\nthe Carnetori Kingdom.\n"

The  elf  sent  forth three\nchampions, while Levodas and his two closest companions stepped forth against them. The\nbattle   began   disastrously  for  Levodas:  his  two  companions  were  slain  immediately.\nHowever  Levodas stoically fought on, and slew the three champions one by one. When the\nbattle was over and won, the petty local king offered him his crown, and pledged to live the\nrest  of  his  days  as  a  serf. It was only at that point that Levodas allowed himself to weep\nover  the  death  of his two companions. From this episodes originates the Malacnari saying\n"Only the victors may weep".\n\n===The Duel for Citizenship===\nAfter  Malacnar  was  founded  - starting as a village - citizenship was only granted to those\ndeemed  worthy  of joining the companions. As such, a harsh test was devised: new arrivals\nwho  wanted to join the village were greeted by Levodas who gave them a good sword, then\nhe  ordered  to hold out for three minutes against him. Those who survived were welcomed\ninto Malacnar, whereas the others were slain.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

If a lich cannot provide enough souls\nto sustain its phylactery its body crumbles and its mind erodes into a primal nature - which\nwhile  mindless  and  incapable  of  intelligent  thought,  can  still cast magic through sheer\ninstinct alone.\n\nThe  first  act  of  a  newly-formed  demilich is to find gems and slot it into its eyes. These\ngems  are then enchanted to act as traps for would-be graverobbers, who upon touching the\ngem  will  have  their  soul trapped to feed the demilich. The soul gems exist exclusively to\nfeed the demilich, and cannot return it to sentience.\n\nIt  is not uncommon for demiliches to lay dormant for centuries as an unsuspecting skull in\na  tomb  only  to  awaken  when  possible  prey  is  nearby - during which the demilich will\nmaneuvre itself as an enticing treasure, to the point that some adventurers have noted skulls\nfollowing them from out of a tombs.\n\n=== Shadow Lich ===\nA powerful and extremely rare version of a lich, in which the lich transfers its soul not into\na  physical  phylactery  but  with the shadowswamps of the Yezel Mora in Sarhal, where the\nShadow Plane bleeds most into the Prime Material Plane."

On the side of the Prime Material, the shadow liches\nstrive  to  control  the  Yezel  Mora  to  protect  it,  defending it from any would-be settlers\nseeking to bring the light of civilization in the darkest corners of the swamp.\n\nAs  they  do  not  have  phylacteries  and  instead  have  their  souls in flux between the two\nplanes,  a  shadow  lich  and  their  soul  are  constantly  being  pulled towards and into the\nShadow  Plane  and  then towards the Fugue Plane. To prevent this a myriad of spells must\nbe  maintained  where  a  traditional  lich  can  rely  on  a  phylactery  that can be left once\ncreated.  Instead,  a  shadow  lich  takes  great  efforts  in  maintaining a corporeal form to\nmaintain  this  flux,  as  the  Prime  Material  is  very  much  connected with corporeal and\nphysicality.

 page_events.893.d: "\nThe  Lilac  Wars  was a series of conflicts from 1348 to 1443 that were waged between the\nHouse  of  Silmuna,  the  Emperors  of  Anbennar  and  Grand Dukes of Dameria, and the\nHouse  of  Siloriel,  rulers  of the Kingdom of Lorent over succession of both the Lorentish\nand   Anbennarian   thrones.  As  the  conflicts  progressed  the  terms  “Moon  Party”  for\nsupporters  of  Dameria  and  “Rose  Party”  for  supporters  of  Lorent would come about,\nthough members of each party would switch sides throughout the war. The war was divided\ninto  four  parts: the First Lilac War (1348 - 1375), the Second Lilac War (1381 - 1400),\nthe Third Lilac War (1407-1421) and the Fourth Lilac War (1422-1443).\n\n== Name Origins ==\nThere  have been many theorized reasons why the Lilac Wars is named as it was. One such\nreason  was  that  the  skies  over  Bigwheat,  a  province  in the Small Country, was such a\nbeautiful  and  purple-ish  pink  afternoon  sky  that  the two clashing armies of Lorent and\nAnbennar  stopped  fighting  for  a  moment to take in the view. Another reason was simply\nthat the blue of Dameria and red of Lorent, when mixed together, made a shade of lilac.\n\n==History==\n===Prelude===\nThe  event  that immediately preceded the Lilac Wars was known as the Imperial Crisis, in\nwhich  a  divided  electorate  for  the  Empire  of  Anbennar  put  Riannón  Silmuna on the\nImperial  throne at the age of 5 - due in part to her connection with the House of Silmuna,\nbut  primarily  due  to  her  immense magical potential. The Empire was soon divided over\nthe fate of the child-empress: whether such a young girl should be allowed to rule, whether\nholding magical prowess as such an important factor could bring back the old magocracy of\nAnbennar, or whether the danger of a Silmuna hegemony over Cannor was worth it.\n\nIn  the end, the Event of 1348 forced the abdication of the child-empress, in which she cast\na  magical  mind-dominating  spell  across the city, before being slain by her own kinsman.\nThe  nobles  were  severely  divided  over  the vote for the next Emperor, debating whether\nanother  Silmuna Emperor was the desired objective. During the debate, a small group was\nable  to  wrangle  enough  votes  to  elect  a foreign ruler as the new Emperor of Anbennar:\nReán Siloriel, King of Lorent."

The Lilac Wars soon began, with the first\nobjective to oust the Lorentish Emperor Reán the White Fox.\n\nIn  1364,  17  years after the start of the First Lilac War, Reán died of old age and another\nimperial  election  was  held,  with  the  young  and  popular Grand Duke Vincen Silmuna\nbecoming  Emperor,  despite  the  actions  of  Vincen's  own  sister Riannón years prior, it\nseemed  the  petty  lords  of  Anbennar  preferred  an  internal  Silmuna  hegemony  over a\nLorentish  one. The two factions eventually settled peace and the young Vincen was wed to\nReán's daughter Eilís Siloriel.\n\nIn  1381  the  Lorentish throne suffered a succession crisis, in which the reigning Lorentish\nqueen, Reánna III, died without trueborn children, placing her aunt, Vincen's wife Eilís, as\nheir  to  the  throne. With this claim and his backing as Emperor, Vincen declared war for\nthe Lorentish throne in the 23-year-long Second Lilac War. The war ended with a truce, as\nboth  sides  grew  weary  of  the  war,  along  with  the  significant  destruction in the Small\nCountry nearly driving a Cannor-wide famine.\n\nThe  Third Lilac War began in 1407, only 3 years after the previous war, with Vincen "the\nOld  Owl"  pushing  his  son  Adénn's  claim  to the Lorentish throne once again. The war\nnearly  came  to a Silmuna victory, until Vincen's death in 1421 which caused a severe loss\nof power for the House of Silmuna.\n\nThe  Fourth  Lilac  War  continued  right  after  Vincen's  death,  with  the Silmuna family\nforcing  a halt in the election process while Adénn Silmuna raced back home from the war.\nUpon  arriving  there, the night before the official elections, Adénn and his host were beset\nupon in the Battle of the Moon Council by hidden Lorentish forces and men under control\nof  the  Emperor-to-be,  Lothane  III  síl  Wex.

However,  when  the Wine Lords capitulated in 1441, Adénn faced a losing\nwar  and  many  of  his  former  allies surrendered as well, in exchange for receiving lighter\npenalties  than  what  would  be served to him and his house. In 1442 the Isle of Damesear\nwas  invaded  by  a  coalition  of  Lorentish  and  Wexonard forces. The end of the war was\neerily  reminiscent  of  the Imperial Crisis: Adénn sought refuge within the Imperial Palace\nwhere  he  was  slain  by  his own kinsman, this time by Erlan of Wesdam, a distant cousin\nwho had allied with Lorent rather than their kin in Dameria.\n\n===Aftermath===\nBoth  sides  lost  a considerable amount of wealth and power during the war.

 page_events.899.d: "\nThe  following  list  of  fey is non-exhaustive compilation of known "types" or "species" of\nfey.  It  is  important  to  remember  that  new  fey are discovered every year and this list is\nsubject  to  change.  Finally,  as  per  feyology  standards, this article has been organized by\nplane of origin followed by sapience.\n\n==Prime Material==\n===Sapient===\n====Centaurs====\nHalf  man,  half  horse,  centaurs  are  considered  one  of  the  bestial races and spawns of\nAgrados  by  the  followers  of  the  Regent  Court.  Centaurs  were driven from Cannor by\nCastan  Beastbane  many  centuries  ago,  and  now  reside  in  the  Forbidden  Plains. The\nconnection  of these exodus centaurs to the Feyrealm has since been lost, but in the deepest\nreaches  of the Deepwoods, and even the Feyrealm itself, there are sometimes still centaurs\nspotted, especially in the River Grove.\n====Satyrs====\nSatyrs  are  a  joyful,  carefree  race,  human  in  appearance  apart from their goat legs and\nhorns.  Historically  they,  like  the  Centaurs,  were  persecuted  as  bestial race by Castan\nBeastbane,  though  they  lacked  any of the martial traditions of their fellow fey. However,\nthese hostile perceptions had softened by time of the Greentide. Countless records describe\nadventurers  and  common  folks  alike  being  as  likely  to  take  part  in  Satyr revels and\nafter-revels as they were to drive them away by force.\n====Pixies====\nPixies, also known as sprites, are a race of fey who resemble a tiny humanoid with butterfly\nwings,  often clothed in leaves. They are known to be mischievous but generally harmless if\na  bit  slow.  They are frequently recorded to even sometimes be helpful when encountering\nstrangers  in  trouble.  This  compassion  is  often  taken  advantage  of by those wishing to\ncapture them, as bandits will leave wounded travelers out as bait to attract pixies to catch.\n====Sylphs====\nSylphs  have  a  very tenuous physical form, and are able to simply dissolve themselves into\nair  to  be  carried  away  by  the  wind.  They  are similar in appearance to pixies, but have\nthinner,  transparent wings. They can be found all over the material plane, as they are fond\nof travel, but they have communal homes that they will return to periodically."
 page_events.2436.t: "List of Fey 2 / 6"
 page_events.2436.d: "\n====Dobies====\nDobies  are  small  humanoid  fey who will secretly move into the dwellings of other races.\nThey  will  eat  from  their  food  and  use  their  supplies,  while  in return leaving gifts or\nperforming  deeds  such  as  cleaning.  If  a  dobie trusts the owner of a house enough, they\nmight  approach  them  and  offer  to  either  make this arrangement official or leave. If an\nagreement  is  made  and  broken,  however, houses have been known to mysteriously burn\ndown.\n====Boggles====\nBoggles  are  misshapen  oily  creatures who live in holes underground. Often considered a\npest  if  they settle down in a farmer’s fields, they can be quite the hassle to deal with. They\nare  however  intelligent,  and  if  successfully  communicated with they can be bribed with\nfruit to simply find somewhere else to burrow.\n====Treants====\nTreants  are  an  odd  race,  as  they  seem  to  come  into existence when trees in some way\nexposed  to  the fey realm become very old. Their dispositions towards mortals vary wildly,\noften  in direct relation to how it and its environment was treated before it gained sapience.\nAn  old  tree in a treasured garden might turn into a loyal protector and wise advisor, while\na  tree  near  an industrial lumber yard may turn into a monstrous thing that will attack any\nmortal on sight.\n\n==== Swamp Trolls ====\nSwamp  trolls  are  the  descendants  of  the trolls that were sold by the giants to Hireet, an\nannis  hag,  in return for a weapon to use against the dragons. For several generations, they\nlived  in  the  Feyrealm,  where  they  slowly  became  more  feylike. For instance, they are\nunable  to  tell lies, and are magically bound to honour deals. Later, they would be used to\npopulate the Shadowswamp in Sarhal.\n\n===Non-Sapient===\n====Asrai====\nAsrai  are small fey creatures who live in rivers and lakes. Not much is known about them,\nbut  travelers  have  been  known  to  tell  stories  about  being  saved by them as they were\ndrowning."
 page_events.2437.t: "List of Fey 3 / 6"
 page_events.2437.d: "\n====Bonehoarders====\nBizzare,  unshapely  creatures who roam the Bone Grove collecting the various bones there\nto  build  intricate  geometric  structures. Mortal creatures nearby are subjected to invasive\nthoughts of self harm and the desire to die. Bonehoarders tend to be solitary, but have been\nknown   to   group  up  from  time  to  time  and  roam  together,  seemingly  in  search  of\nsomething.\n====Kelpie====\nKelpies  are  carnivorous,  preying  on  anything  they find by relying on their shapeshifting\nability.  They  will  present  themselves  as  an attractive person of the opposite sex of their\ntarget,  only  to turn back into their real form, a misshapen horse, when the victim gets too\nclose.\n\n==== Unicorns ====\nOriginally  native  to  Aelantir,  unicorns  have spread to several places across Halann, and\nhold   great  cultural  significance  in  some  regions.  While  not  sapient,  they  are  more\nintelligent  than  regular  horses,  and  interbreeding  them  with horses has produced some\nimpressive mounts. It is also believed that unicorn hearts have potent magical applications.\n\n==== Abada ====\nNative  to  Sarhal,  Abada  are  the  fey-altered product of a mix of donkeys and antelopes.\nThey have two crooked horns, a long tail, and are herbivores. Abada are prized by hunters,\nas a substance in their horns is able to act as an antidote to a very wide array of poisons.\n==Feyrealm==\n===Sapient===\n====Hags====\nHags  are a race of witches, who are hated by almost all other fey. They were driven out by\nthe  fey long ago before the Deepwoods were even known as the Oldwoods, but can still be\nfound in the Feyrealm itself and all planes of existence, carving out domains for themselves\nor their covens in even the most unlikely of places.\n====Faerie dragons===="
 page_events.2438.t: "List of Fey 4 / 6"
 page_events.2438.d: "\nFaerie  dragons  are  very  rarely seen outside of the Feyrealm, but those that have ventured\ninto  the  material  plane  have  been  described  as  honorable,  brave,  and  kind  hearted.\nHowever,  they  do  not  feel  quite  comfortable  in the material plane, and always yearn to\nreturn  to  the  Feyrealm.  Important  to  note, faerie dragons are not actual dragons. Their\nname originates from how their form is akin to a dragon’s body with that of a faerie’s wings.\nThat  said,  there  are  some who hypothesize that faerie dragons came into existence due to\ndragons being exposed to the Feyrealm in the distant past.\n====Dryads====\nDryads  have female humanoid figures, but most everything else about them is plant-based.\nThey  vary  widely  in  appearance,  some having skin of tough bark and hair of oak leaves,\nwhile  others  have  more aspects of flowers or grains. Almost all dryads have strong innate\nmagic,  and  usually  live  in  isolated  communities  away  from  mortals or even other fey.\nOutsiders  who  wander  into  their  territory,  be  they aware or unaware of the dryads, are\nrarely seen again.\n====Spriggans====\nOften  confused  with Dryads, Spriggans are humanoid fey creatures made of wood. Unlike\nDryads,  however,  they  do  not  reproduce  naturally,  but  are created intentionally by fey\nmagic animating fallen branches and leaves into humanoid form. In almost all cases, this is\ndone by archfey creating servants to do their bidding, though sometimes warlocks attain the\npower  to  do  this  as  well. They are often discarded by their careless masters after having\ncompleted the task they were created for, free to wander and live out the rest of their life as\nthey see fit.\n====Changelings====\nBorn  from  firstborns  given  to the Trader of Masks, changelings are capable of taking the\nform  of  other  sapient  creatures.  Throughout  its early life, a changeling will roam trying\ndifferent  forms  until  it  eventually  finds one that it feels is “correct.” Once they’ve taken\nthis  form,  a  changeling  will  work  to  integrate itself into that creature’s society all while\nforgetting  its  own  origin.  If  the changeling has a child, which is always a changeling, the\nchild  will  eventually  instinctually leave its birth family to find its own “correct” form and\nrepeat the cycle."

 page_events.2439.d: "\n====Fairies====\nWidely  believed  to  be  a  cousin  of the Prime Material plane-native pixie, fairies exhibit\nmany  of  the  same  traits as pixies such as their diminutive winged forms and mischievous\nnature.  Fairies,  however,  differ notably in the complexity of their societies. Fully fledged\nclans are common in fairie society and wars, if bloodless, have been known to erupt.\n====Nymphs====\nNymphs  are  a  versatile  type  of  fey,  who are able to adapt themselves to many different\ntypes  of  environments.  Because  of  this, they have received many different names. Those\nthat  adapt  themselves  to  living  in  freshwater  are  known  as  Naiads,  those that live in\nsaltwater  are known as Nereids (or Nummo in Ardimya). Their environment changes who\nthey  are  to  a  deep  level,  also  affecting  the  kinds  of  magic  they  use  and  even their\ntemperament.  Nymphs are shapeshifters in a way, but they only change their appearance to\nmatch  their  environment  very  slowly  over  long  periods of time. Still, their appearance\nremains  somewhat  similar,  always having a form that somewhat resembles a female elf. It\nhas  been  suggested  that this is in honor of the Fey Queen of the Seelie Court, with which\nall Nymphs are aligned.\n===Non-Sapient===\n====Aralez====\nWinged  canine-like  fey who are attracted to creatures exhibiting bravery and loyalty. They\ntend to roam the Feyrealm and Material Plane in search of individuals of such a nature and\ntake  to spending time with them much like a dog would. However, after a given time, they\neventually move on in search of new persons.\n====Banshee====\nBanshee  are  malicious  fey,  who  appear  to  feed  on  fear.  They tend to use wailing and\nscreaming  to terrify their victims, and if this isn’t enough they often resort to more extreme\nmeasures.\n====Giant Moths====\nAssociated  with  the  Herald of Change, giant moths are generally docile creatures that are\neasy to tame. Small creatures such as goblins are able to ride them.\n====Will-o’-wisp===="

For the\nriver, see Arverynn River.''\n\nThe  Lordship  of  Arverynn,  later  Empire  of Arverynn, self-referred to as Ynnic Empire,\nsometimes  called  Sarda  Empire  (not  to be confused with the post-1811 Sarda Empire),\nalso  styled  as the Teal Crest after its emblem, was one of the successor states of the Ynnic\nEmpire.\n\nFollowing  the  fall  of the empire and the death of Fineas Vyrekynn, last reigning emperor,\nArverynn  would  be one of the many states vying for the remains of the empire, in a period\nposteriorly  called  Age  of  Petty  Lords.  This  period  ended  with  the  return  of  House\nVyrekynn,  who styled themselves as emperors once again and led to Arverynn's resurgence\nin power until its annexation by High Havoral in 1789. The rebellion that later ensued and\nwhich  restored  Vyrekynn  rule  would  lead  to  what outside powers would refer to as the\nSarda Empire.\n\n==History==\n===Founding of the City===\nIn  900,  following  the  Battle of the Arverynn, Emperor Calrodiy I recognized the town of\nArverynn's   defensibility  as  well  as  its  strategic  proximity  to  both  Dolindha  and  the\nVeykodan  Overlands, and ordered it to be renovated and an artificial hill to be constructed\nto hold lavish housings for the knights and military, dubbing it Vyrisar Hill.\n\n===Age of Petty Lords===\nFollowing  the  death  of Fineas the Lynched, minor nobles would attempt to rule the great\ncity during the 13th and 14th centuries. With the task of fighting off economic decline, the\nodd  rabble-rousing preacher and the schemes of their own court, Arverynn would continue\nto  lose  influence  and  its  capital's population continued to shrink as it lost its relevance.\nOnce loyal subjects such as the lords of Stanyrhrada could no longer be controlled, and the\nVeykodan frontier was left more and more unguarded."
 page_events.2452.t: "Lordship of Arverynn 2 / 3"
 page_events.2452.d: "\n\n===Return of The Emperor===\nIn 1386, Calrodiy IV, last scion of the house Vyrekynn returned to the city at the head of a\ncompany  of  shining  knights and mercenaries, and took control over the lordship from the\npetty  lord  who  occupied it. He was eagerly accepted by the citizens and celebrations were\nheld  in  his  honour,  The  city  celebrated  Calrodiy  as  a  liberator,  and he returned this\nwarmth  with  weeks of festivities. However, this victory would be Calrodiy's first and last.\nThe  aspiring  emperor  overestimated  his  neighbours'  willingness  to  submit to him and\nrejoin  the glorious empire, losing the chance for peaceful reunification with his diplomatic\nblunders, and emptying the treasury with his lavish festivities.\n\n===Alaran's War===\nAlaran  yen  Cestor,  a  young  lord  of  minor  prestige  from  Trompolere, embarked on a\nmilitary  campaign to restore the Ynnic Empire in 1443. Initially he defeats Fadhevych and\nforces  them  out of the war, following this he marches on Arverynn. He meets the army of\nArverynn  near  Arvezl and scores a surprising victory once again. Filimir II, lord of Arvezl\nand  an  Iosahar  of Arverynn, switches sides to Trompolere, along with most of Arverynn's\nsurviving  knights.  Following  his  victory,  he  continued  towards  the  city  of  Arverynn.\nCalrodiy  IV,  knowing  that  he  had  no  army  to  defend his city with, took to diplomacy\ninstead.  Calling  in  every  personal  favor  he  could, he manages to pool together enough\nfunds  to  bribe  Alaran  to  not besiege the city, and take his conquests elsewhere. This left\nArverynn  deep  in  debt,  with little hinterlands, a weary populace unwilling to serve in the\narmy, and an emperor with one foot in the grave.\n\n===Emergence of the Veykodan Guard===\nCalrodiy  IV's  last  notable  action  was  one  that had drastic effects on the Lordship, and\nsome  even  attribute  Arverynn's  resurgence  to  it. Lacking the manpower to even enforce\ntaxes  in  the lands he controlled, Calrodiy IV increasingly hired Veykodan adventurers and\nfortune  seekers  to  supplement  his  military.  While  many  saw  this  as  controversial, it\nallowed Arverynn to enforce control over what little territories it had remaining."

Carodin  II sought solutions both in new and old ways. Old titles, unused for\ncenturies,  were  repurposed  as a way to reward loyal and competent servants to the throne,\nalong with generous wages to ensure they stayed that way. These titles were non-inheritable,\nand  as  such Carodin II was able to redistribute them to new blood when the old perished.\nIn   1450,   he  formalized  the  Veykodans  adventurers  in  service  of  Arverynn  into  the\nVeykodan  Guard,  a  unit  of  Veykodan  soldiers  that  would  soon  become  the  core  of\nArverynn's  army until the creation of the Predyvens System. The Veykodan Guard allowed\nCarodin II to succesfully reclaim large amounts of lands during his reign, with many of the\nSarda  not  being  used  to  fighting  Veykodans,  their last major invasion being almost two\ncenturies ago.\n\n===Rule of Calrodiy V===\nFollowing  the  death  of  Lord Ultaran the Kind of Vels Bacar without an heir, Vels Bacar\nTransitioned  into  a  republic by his will. Seeing opportunity, Calrodiy V, declares for one\nof  his  vassals  (Baron  Armynn  of Poelnebo) who had a claim on Vels Bacar, starting the\nWar  of  the  Bacaran  Succession.  While  Arverynn was victorious, the war had exhausted\nArverynn's  manpower,  with  many  of  its  farmlands  now  without owner, nor soldiers to\ndefend the newly conquered territories. As a result, in the decade that followed the Bacaran\nsuccession war the Predyvens System was implemented.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

It is known for its high red walls, high culture,\ncourtly intrigue and impeccable streets.\n\n==History==\n===Origins===\nThe  ancient  origins  of  the  city  lie  in the various outposts built by Castanor around the\neastern  reaches  of the Bloodwine around 450 BA. These outposts were meagre at best and\nwere  said  to  be  scouting and tradings posts for the local Lencori tribes. During this time\nCastanor  had  brought  much  of  Escann  and Dostanor to its dominion, and had founded\ngreat  colonial  cities  like  Vertesk  and Damenath to exert its influence on the Dameshead\nsea, and the proto-Redfort lands served as a soft border for the empire.\n\nNot  much  else  is  known  of the coming and goings of the pre-Redfort sites, but it would\nonly be under the Damerian Republic that Redfort would grow to prominence.\n\n===Under the Damerian Republic===\nIn  288  BA  the  Damerian Republic seceded from Castanor during the Second War of the\nCerulean   League   and   by  this  time  the  Redfort  proper  had  been  constructed.  The\nDamerians  had  retained  a  trading policy with the tribes and maintained cordial relations\nduring  this time, using the site as a main way to trade and recruit Lencori auxiliaries in the\nwar.\n\nThe  Redfort,  like  it  did  for  Castanor,  proved  as  a  reliable  border  for the Damerian\nRepublic  in their many attempts of conquering Lencenor but eventually during the Lencori\nWars  in  78  the  republic,  along  with  the  Gnomish  Hierarchy,  partitioned  the  region\namongst  themselves,  and the Redfort grew into a city and served as the regional capital for\nthe republic.\n\n===During The Dragonwake==="

Many refugees would\neventually  seek  refuge  with  the Rubenti tribe downriver that had been granted settlement\nand  vasalan  status  by  the  republic,  and  soon  a second city would be built at the site of\nmodern-day Lorentainé.\n\n===Lorentish Kingdom and High Kingdom of Lencenor===\nIn  523  the  lands  around  the  Redfort  became  the heartlands of the Lorentish Kingdom\nfounded by the warlord Lorenan the Great, and the city downriver was subsequently refered\nto  as  Lorent-by-the-River.  Only  two  years  later  Lorenan  was  elected as High King of\nLencenor and the city tripled in size, and became the de-facto capital of the entire region.\n\n=== War of the Three Roses ===\nThe  city  of Lorent-by-the-River was caught right in the middle of the war, changing hands\nat  various  times  during  the  22  years  of  conflict.  The Ruby Crown was brought to the\nRedfort  for  protection,  and  the  capital  of  the  High  Kingdom suffered greatly with the\nvarious  assaults  and  counter  assaults  as  it  was  used as a staging ground for the various\nEntebenic sieges of Redfort.\n\n=== Years of the Broken Rose ===\nBeing  part  of  the  lands assigned to the Lord Regents of Lencenor saved the city from the\nconflicts  that plagued the neighbouring realms, and the importance of Lorent-by-the-River\nas  the  economic and cultural capital of Lencenor was recovered despite it not holding any\nroyal court and the Lord Regents ruling from the Redfort itself. Most reunions between the\nrival  kings  took  place  there,  as  it was considered neutral ground, and the weddings that\nstarted the Spring of the Three Kings took place here as well.\n\n=== Era of Black Ice ===\nThe  city  was  left  undisturbed  for  most  of  the  Era  of  Black Ice, despite it feeling the\nreduction of trade and the insecurity brought by the coastal raids. Ironically, the population\nof  Lorent-by-the-River  grew  as  a  result  of  this, with the outskirts of the city growing to\naccomodate  the  population  that  the  southwestern  Caylenath  (future Kyliande) couldn't\nhandle."

His impact within the\nera  would  be  well-felt  with  his aid in the foundation of the Corintar 'sect' of the Regent\nCourt,  as  well  as  his general presence as a figure of note in Escann during such a time of\nupheaval and reform.\n\nLothane's  famous 'title' has its namesake in a piece of blue cloth, tied around his left tusk,\nthat   had   belonged   to  his  mother;  the  Silmuna  Eilís  the  Blue.  Whether  it  was  in\nremembrance of her, or as a reminder to himself of his own 'humanity' is unknown.\n\nThere  are records, however scarce, of a relationship between Corin and Lothane.

His birth would mark him as one\nof the last of the main branch of House of Silmuna within his lifetime.\n\nAfter his birth, his mother cared from him as best as she could for year and a half, however\nher  continued  mistreatment  saw  her die in her captivity, leaving him truly alone. All that\nwould  remain of her to Lothane were crumbling memories of a beautiful and kind woman,\nand what was left of her blue scarf.\n\n==Orcish Warrior==\nAs a half-orc of the Bladebreaker's, Lothane had to prove himself early and with vigor if he\nwanted  to  survive.  Throughout  his early life he was hardened; being beaten and mocked.\nThis  would  not last long however, as when Lothane grew strong and tall enough to defend\nhimself the matter simply resolved itself.\n\nBy  the  time  of his young-adulthood he'd earned enough recognition to become a Captain\nof a minor Warband led by the brutal orc, Karagh Bloodfist.

It was\ntaken  to  Arverynn where it was healed and made to fight in the arena. The dragon became\none of the most popular arena contenders and gained a great following over the years.\n\nThe  dragon  was  then  nameless,  simply  referred  to  as  "the  dragon". It would be later\nknown as Drozmagog.\n\nIn  1028  AA  a  group  of  devoted  followers,  spurred  on  by nefarious cultists, freed the\ndragon,  who  immediately  enacted  his revenge on the city by setting it on fire. The Great\nFire  of Arverynn, as it came to be known, lasted for three days despite the desperate efforts\nof Ynnic water mages to contain it, and left many districts of the city in ruins.\n\n==The Campaign==\nImmediately the ruling Emperor Camar I swore revenge for Arverynn's devastation, and set\nout  at  the  head of the Imperial army towards the Epednan Expanse, where the dragon was\nlast seen in flight.\n\nAny Epednar tribe who opposed the hunt for the dragon (either by attacking Camar's army,\nby  refusing his passage, by refusing to disclose information about the dragon's whereabouts\nor  by  providing  false  information)  was attacked and evicted from its territory. Captured\nEpednar  were  mass-deported  to  Arverynn  where  they  were put to forced labour for the\ncity's reconstruction.\n\n==Founding of the Prealtac==\nA  number  of  fortified  outposts  called  ''prealtac''  were  built  all  across the Expanse to\npreside the territories hostile tribes had been evicted from. These outposts did not promote\nsettler-colonization,  but  nonetheless  expanded  the  Ynnic  Empire's influence by keeping\nwatch over the Epednar's movements and presiding their trade routes."

Paranoia  about  the possible rise of a dragon cult would\npersist for the remainder of the Ynnic Empire's history.\n\nBy  the  end  of  1029,  Arverynn  had  been rebuilt and much of the Epednan Expanse was\nunder the Ynnic Empire's protection.\n\nWhile the captured tribes were eventually released and Imperial outposts were successful in\nensuring  that  Drozmagog  never gained a following among the Epednar, the Epednar grew\nresentful  of  the  Ynnic  invaders  after  been  forced  to  pay for the dragon's actions. This\nresentment paved the way for Chief Hubinach's rise to power forty years later.\n\nBy  1076,  the  Epednar  tribes  had  united  behind a single leader and followed him on an\ninvasion  of  the  Ynnic  Empire. The resulting Epednar horde was described to be of a size\nunparalleled  in  Ynnic history, and accomplished the destruction of the ''prealtac'' and the\ndepopulation  of  several  of  the  Ynnic  Empire's  border  provinces  in the west before its\neventual defeat at the Battle of Konyrhrada.\n\n==The Dragon's Fate==\nThe  dragon-hunters'  worst  fear  would eventually come to pass when the dragon returned\nduring  the  chaos  of the Third Ynnic Civil War and became acclaimed as a god, receiving\nthe  name  of  Drozmagog from his followers as Rzenta underwent a mass conversion to the\nDrozma Tur faith."

However,  it  is  also  linked  to the concept of\nmagic-user supremacy and has been challenged by various schools of thought.\n\n== Applications ==\n\n=== Formation of Anbennar ===\nThe  most  famous  example  and  the origin of the term was the Formation of Anbennar in\n1221  when  a  group  of  mages,  mostly court mages and other influential magical groups,\nconspired  to  enforce  the mages' peace against the warlords of the The Interregnum which\nhad brought chaos and warfare in Western Cannor. What this led to was the creation of the\nEmpire  of  Anbennar  which  unified  the lands surrounding the Dameshead Sea under one\nentity led by a Mage Emperor, a magic-user who directly ruled the empire.\n\nThis  practice  eventually  ended  twenty years later during the Wars of Rule (1244 - 1284)\nwhen  the  mage  emperors  were  supplanted  by  a  noble  emperor.  The  mages  did gain\nconcession  by  adding  the  requirement that the noble emperor must be able to cast magic\n(which  was  more  likely  as  the  Silver  Families  that dominated the dove throne were of\nhalf-elven   blood),   that   too   eventually   become   a  largely  outdated  and  ceremonial\nrequirement.  The  mages  did  however  retain a position of great influence over Anbennar\nunder the Grand Magister whose authority was second only to the emperor.\n\n=== The Magisterium ===\nThe  success  of  ending  the  Interregnum  also  saw the rise of the Magisterium which was\nfounded  alongside the Empire of Anbennar by members of the same initiative that founded\nthe  empire.  The Magisterium oversaw the regularization of magical practices across much\nof  Cannor  in  order  to  not only prevent magical misuse but also to maintain unity of the\nmagical population under one single body, which it had not been during the Interregnum."

Magic is most commonly learned\nand used in pre-defined forms called "spells".\n\n==History==\nMany creation myths rely on the fact that the entire world itself was created through magic.\nDespite  this,  controlled  magic  was  a  rare and poorly-understood ability throughout the\nearly  histories  of  Halann.  It  was  during the Day of Ashen Skies in 0 BA that magic as a\ntool was reawakened in the peoples of the land.\n\nIt  is generally understood that almost anyone could learn how to wield magic in theory.

Specialists in this school are called Abjurers.\n*School  of  Divination:  Deals  in  spells that reveal information, such as scrying or telling\nthe future. Specialists in this school are called Diviners.\n*School  of  Illusion:  Deals  in  spells  that  alter  perceptions  and create false images and\nsounds, such as altering one's appearance.

While  powerful  in  its  own  right,  Divine  Magic  is  seen as a more passive and\nritualistic  form  of  magic  and  not suited for combat or everyday use. The mage also risks\nlosing  their  magic  if  they  fall out of favour from their divine source. But the opposite is\nalso possible: the powerless could find themselves imbued with sudden divine prowess.\n* Druidic Magic: Although thought separate in the past, this is now commonly theorized as\na  sub-field of Divine Magic. Druidic Magic is largely ritualistic and said to originate from\nthe Fey Realm.\n*  Rune  Magic:  The traditional dwarven form of magic. Rune Magic primarily deals with\nusing  runes  as  words  of power, similar to how magic circles can be drawn to control and\ncreate  magical  effects.  Runes  are usually inscribed onto hard surfaces, but the Veykodan\nruinborn in Aelantir have developed magical runic tattoos.\n* Bardic Magic: This is a sub-field of enchantment magic, but has received much attention\ndue  to  its  highly  noticeable  nature.  Bardic  Magic  is  the use of song, dance or artistic\nperformance  to  channel magic power. Bardic Magic is in turn subdivided into "Colleges"\nthat focus on different uses and performance styles. This form is most famously used by the\nSkaldskolan skalds, as well as the Seinathíl troubadour Alarian Singkeep."

It can be granted by others who wield the power (from\npersonal  imbuement,  blood  or otherwise), it can be gained from objects imbued with the\npower,  and  most  importantly,  it  can  be  gained  from  pure  will  and  conviction of the\nindividual.\n*Most  if not all gods are false, but merely beings of magical power. Clerics and other holy\nmen  who  have  the  power  to  cast  magic  have  gained it through their personal will and\nconviction, not gods.\n\n=== Ravelian True Source Hypothesis ===\nThe  Ravelian  Church  uses  a  variant  of  this  hypothesis  in  their  research  on the God\nFragment.  Ravelian  scripture portrays the God Fragment as the last essence of a One God\nand  claims  that the 'True Source' is in fact this One God, making magic inherently divine\nin  nature.  During  the  Fourth  Ravelian  Debate,  the  church  also claimed that the God\nFragment  was  created  by  the precursor elves destroying God. Additionally, the ability to\ncontrol and wield magic is supposedly the last of a long line of sins against God.\n== Effect on Biology ==\n\n=== General Biology ===\nMagical  affinity  has  a  direct  impact  on  the  biology  of the individual. Powerful mages\ncommonly live about a decade longer than their ordinary peers, even without the assistance\nof  specific  anti-aging  spells.  Magical  potential  is  also  strongly  linked to a decrease in\nfertility."
 page_events.2465.t: "Magic 5 / 5"
 page_events.2465.d: "\n\n===Blueblood Theory===\nThe  Blueblood  Theory proposes that magic is inherently an ability that is passed down via\ngenetic  inheritance.  Simply  put:  the  stronger  the  magical  affinity of one's parents, the\nstronger  the  affinity  will  be  for  the child. As such, many prestigious magical bloodlines\nhave been preserved throughout the century, and it is a clear fact that powerful mages make\neven more powerful children.\n\nDespite  this,  supporters  of  the  theory concede that it is not a total explanation. It is not\nuncommon  for  children of powerful mages to have no magical skill at all, nor for random\nindividuals to discover latent magical ability despite having no familial history with the art.\n\n=== Floodborn ===\nThe   unique   phenomena  started  by  the  Crimson  Deluge  led  to  the  creation  of  the\nFloodborn,  which  caused  mages  born  in  Escann to surge in raw magical ability in those\nborn.  The  caveat was that the Floodborn were consistently beset by an affliction known as\nThe Drowning, which often coincided with heavy rains of the deluge. This caused mages to\ngo  unconscious  and for their lungs and body to magically fill up with water and other foul\nfluids,  and  it  was  up  for  the unconscious mage to use their innate magical willpower to\nstave off and survive the attack.\n\nThis caused three things:\n\n*  Escann,  from  the  Deluge  onwards,  had  a greatly lower population of mages (as most\nwould die due to the Drowning, often during childhood)\n*  Any  mages that survived the Drowning would be known as Floodborn: mages known for\ntheir extraordinary raw magic potential\n* The rise of the Witch Kings Era which saw Floodborn take over many of the kingdoms of\nthe   region.   Many  of  these  Floodborn  would  have  been  noble  scions,  surviving  the\nDrowning due to aid only monarchs could afford."

He  is  the  founder  of the Second\nDynasty of Kheterata.\n\nOriginally  a  soldier  from the Ismahapan savanna, he would rapidly rise in the Kheteratan\nmilitary  until he was in charge of all southern forces. He would rise to prominence during\nthe  Incident  of  335,  when  -  with  the  support  of  the  military as well as the Gnomish\nHierarchy  -  he  led a military coup against King Intef III over the king's attempts to form\nan  alliance  with  Castanor.  Proclaiming  that Kheterata would never ally itself with mere\nslaves,  but must instead seize its rightful place as first among nations, Menkaunswt had the\nking  thrown  off a tower and seized the throne for himself. He would usher in a new era of\nKheteratan militarism, with the great goal of his kingship being the conquest of Bulwar and\ncrippling of Castanor.\n\nFollowing  his  coup,  he  established  the  ahati  brotherhoods as a loyal source of military\nsupport,  with  those  soldiers  who  had  supported  his  coup  as the first members. These\nbrotherhoods  would  serve  as  the  vanguard  of  his  various military actions, much to the\ndispleasure of the traditional elites in the priesthood.\n\n==The Akasi Campaign==\nAs  his  first conquest, Menkaunswt would march his army into Akasik in 332 BA. Though\nthe  loyal  Deshaki  would  swear fealty immediately, their cousins to the west had declared\nthe  Republic  of  Ekha.  It  was  a  radical  and  contradictory  state;  rejecting  the rule of\nhereditary   monarchs,   yet  exalting  in  its  descent  from  the  Storm-Queens  of  Akasik;\nembracing  equality  of  the  sexes,  yet  allied  with the strictly gender delineated Binwarji.\nThat  is  to  say,  in the mind of the Kheteratans, it was a republic of rank hypocrisy and an\nexcellent first target.\n\nThe  Ekhan  war  would  see  the  first  deployment  of  what many consider Menkaunswt's\nsignature   strategy;   the   usage   of   new   magical   technologies  as  a  force  multiplier.\nTraditionally, Kheteratan mages were reliant on magical orbs primarily as stores of magical\npower,  while  using  enchanted  rings  or bracers to focus and direct that power. However,\nthese  orbs  were  little  changed from the initial Bulwari examples brought over during the\nfounding of Kheterata."

 page_events.2470.d: "\n\nMenkaunswt  would commission the gnomish lapidaries and tinkerers of Koroshesh to help\ncraft  a  new  type  of  orb; with the gem at the center using the ‘gnomish’, or ‘brilliant’, cut\ncharacterized  by  its 56 facets in contrast to the classical cut with a mere 17. The resulting\ngem  not  only  reflected  more light, but could far more efficiently channel magic energies,\nallowing  much greater amounts of magic to be used at once. However, these gems were far\nharder  to  cut,  and  so  classically cut gems remained the standard with brilliant orbs only\nissued to the most elite mages.\n\nArmed  with  these  new  orbs, Kheterata’s most powerful mages would decimate the Ekhan\narmies,  with  the majority of the Kheteratan army having little role in the short war. Being\nknown  for  their  naval  power,  not  their army, the Ekhans quickly negotiated a favorable\npeace.  In  exchange  for  regular  tribute  and  naval  support in future invasions, Ekha was\nplaced under Kheteratan protection but left to its own affairs internally. Some mountainous\nborder  territories  were  also  confiscated and granted to the Deshaki, who established new\nmines there.\n\n==Humbling A Titan==\nAround  320  BA,  following  various  lesser  wars  in the south, King Menkaunswt began a\nmilitary  build-up  with  obvious  intentions  to  target  his strongest neighbor: Castanorian\nBulwar.  Unlike  his  other targets, Castanor was a historical rival and experienced military\npower,   widely  considered  the  world’s  strongest  empire.  Nevertheless,  Kheterata  held\nseveral  advantages  in  the  conflict;  not  only  was  the  Gnomish Hierarchy a firm ally of\nKheterata,  but  Castanor’s own territories were no longer very happy with their rulers. The\nBulwari  Accord  now  viewed  Castanor  not  as liberators, but as interlopers stealing their\nwell-earned  money  through  their  centralization  attempts,  while Castanor’s own western\nprovinces - united under the Cerulean League - held much the same view.\n\nCastanor  launched  a  surprise  attack in 310 BA that, while a tactical victory, began a war\nthat  would  end  disastrously  for  them.  Many  historians  would  consider  this  war  the\nbeginning of the second Kheteratan Golden Age - an era of triumph second only to the rule\nof  Elikhet  himself  -  which  would  eventually  end  with  Kheterata’s  subjugation  by  it’s\nally-turned-rival Dameria in 105 BA."

Though the Home Legions of Escann would\nhave  likely  fared  better,  those  stationed in Bulwar had by this time run out of legitimate\nthreats  and  were  used to serving as a glorified garrison army. Against Menkaunswt’s ahati\narmies,  supported by well-equipped battlemages and composed of veterans of the southern\ncampaigns, they were at a solid disadvantage. Only half of their number returned to Bulwar\nin defeat, the rest lying dead in the sands of the Salahad.\n\nWith  the devastation of the local Legions, the cities of the Bulwari Accord would slaughter\ntheir   Castanorian  garrisons  and  declare  independence.

Thus  would  the  Coalition  be  formed,  an  alliance  between\nKheterata, the Gnomish Hierarchy, the Bulwari Accord and the Cerulean League dedicated\nto  ending  Castanorian  dominance.  Faced  with  such  a  massive  threat, Castanor would\nofficially  commit  its  Home  Legions  to  the  war,  marking  the  true  start of the War of\nHegemony.\n\n==The War of Hegemony==\nThe  Coalition  began  in  a  victorious position, with Castanor losing more than half of its\nland   overnight,   but  this  was  achieved  not  through  martial  superiority  but  by  sheer\ncircumstance.  As such, the initial enthusiasm of the Coalition was ended when a Cerulean\nLeague  army  was  obliterated  by the Home Legions and the Accord’s attempts to build on\ntheir  success  by  taking  Anzabad  failed miserably. The continued resistance of Castanor’s\nbulwark  in  Bulwar caused fears of a long war - one where it would be Bulwar that was the\nbattlefield.  As  such,  the  Accord  began  planning  how to independently negotiate peace,\nthough it was decided that Anzabad had to fall first regardless.\n\nWhile  half  of  the  Accord’s  forces  stalled  out  besieging Anzabad, the other half quickly\npushed  into  Bahar.  With  the  majority of Castanorian forces busy defending Anzabad or\nfighting  Kheterata  in  the  Sad  Sur  mountain  range,  the advance into Bahar is rapid and\ncomprehensive.  Most  of  Bahar  east  of Aqatbar had been taken by the time Anzabad was\nbetrayed from within and surrendered to the Accord."

 page_events.2472.d: "\n\nAlongside  northern  victories  by the Cerulean League, this would lead to a tentative peace\ndeal  in  300  BA.  The  member  cities  of  the Bulwari Accord and Cerulean League were\ngranted  independence  from  Castanorian  rule,  though  Castanor retained most of Bahar,\nwhile  Kheterata  gained  the  Sad  Sur  mountains  -  a  useful  conquest,  but  far from the\nglorious  victory  Menkaunswt  sought.  With  Kheterata hungering for further gains, as the\nCoalition collapsing into mutual suspicion, a second war was inevitable.\n\n==The Twenty Year Truce==\nAs   befits   its   name,  the  First  War  of  Hegemony  would  be  followed  by  a  second.\nNevertheless,  for  a  time  peace  would  prevail,  allowing  the Bulwari and Damerians to\norganize  their  new  governments while Castanor fortified its remaining lands in Bahar and\nKheterata fought to establish full control over the Sad Sur mountains.\n\nIt  was  during  this  period when the Peyimaaw sect would evolve from a mere propaganda\ntool  to  a  legitimate,  if heterodox, variant of Khetism. Though it’s concept of meritocracy\nwas  initially  instituted  to  uplift  the King’s ahati supporters at the expense of his rivals at\ncourt,  it  would  take  on a life of its own among the general population as retiring soldiers\nbrought  the  Peyimaaw  doctrines  -  and  all  their  loot  from the wars - to their families,\nleading  to  mass  adoption  of  the  sect  by  the  commons. This period would also see the\nreputation  of  the  ahati  improve  dramatically, going from largely ignored frontiersmen to\nthe culture heroes of Kheterata, at least for a time.\n\nThe  reign  of  Menkaunswt is also when the genre of Kheteratan heroic literature would be\nborn,  with  such  stories  as  The  Triumph of Awarim and Danyal’s Last Stand, though the\ngenre   would   reach  its  peak  later  under  Crodamos  rule  when  it  would  incorporate\nCannorian concepts of chivalry.\n\n==Second War of Hegemony==\nEventually,   the   Bulwari   Accord   would   fall  to  infighting  and  face  invasion  by  the\nCastanorians  and  Kheteratans  alike.  Though  an independent realm would survive in the\neast,  led  by  the  High  Priest  of  Eduz-Vacyn  and paying tribute to Kheterata, the rest of\nBulwar  would  be partitioned between Castanor north of the Buranun and Kheterata south\nof  it.  The far east, centered on Azka-Sur, would see itself conquered by gnolls who would\nengage  in  periodic  conflicts with Eduz-Vacyn. Kheterata would expel gnolls from the Sad\nSur  mountains  while  encouraging  human  settlement, so as to bring the local gold mines\nunder state control."

 page_events.993.t: "Metals 1 / 4"
 page_events.993.d: "\nBelow is a list of uncommon or spectacular metals in the world.\n\n==List of Metals==\n===Adamantine===\nAn  incredibly  hard  metal  made  of  the  adamant  ore,  said  to  be  the  hardest metal in\nexistence.\n\n===Arcane Copper===\nCommonly  known  by  its  shorthand  "Arcop",  a damestear-copper alloy used in the late\n19th century to enable the needs of artificery to work with electricity.\n\n===Cold Iron===\nA  rare  type  of iron, Cold Iron isn't forced with fire, but shaped out of raw ore using slow\nand  careful  magical  processes.  Cold  iron  is  especially effective as a weapon against fey\ncreatures, but its brittleness renders it unpractical for any other application.\n\n===Cold Steel===\nA  more  refined  version of cold iron, the process of creating Cold Steel was discovered by\nEordandi  mages.  To  create cold steel, mineral ore is arranged into the desired shape, and\nfrom  there repeatedly transmuted and quenched in leaden solution. As the advancement of\ngunpowder  weapons  led  to  the  widespread  adoption  of  muskets in Eordand, Coldsteel\nweapons were relegated for the cavalry.\n\n=== Damestear Alloys ===\nNot  a specific type of metal, but in general powdered damestear can be mixed into molten\nmetal  to  create  an  alloy. Damestear alloys enabled magic conductivity which enables the\nobject to be affected by magic from protective enchantments to a flaming sword.\n\nThe  biggest  weakness  with damestear alloys is their near universal brittleness and relative\nweakness  compared to the original metal, which makes them impractical and less durable.\nOnly precursor steel has held its durability among the many damestear alloys."
 page_events.2474.t: "Metals 2 / 4"
 page_events.2474.d: "\n\nThe chosen metal also influences conductivity with silver being the most compatible.\n\n===Ebonsteel===\nA  dark steel-like alloy naturally found in the Black Frost Mountains of Urviksten, but also\nable  to  be  created  with  a special formula of metals and minerals. The alloy is somewhat\nlighter  than  steel and is resistant to breaking, bending or melting. Incidentally, the metal's\nresilience  made  it extremely important following the advance of gunpowder technology, as\ncorrectly  prepared  Ebonsteel  armour  offers  decent  protection  against  firearm missiles,\nbeing able to sustain several shots before its structure is damaged.\n\nHistorically,  Ebonsteel's  resilience made it incredible difficult to work with, with only the\nEbonsteel  Forge  in Urviksten being known to be produce a flame hot enough to smelt the\nraw  Ebonsteel  ore.  Following the forge's destruction during Urvic Ebonfrost's reconquest\nof  Urviksten,  the knowledge of forging Ebonsteel was believed to be lost to time, until the\nalloy's  formula  was  rediscovered  in  the  18th  century.  Despite  this, ancient Gerudian\nartefacts (and artefacts predating the Gerudians) could be found wrought of this metal.\n\n===Dagrite===\nA  rare  ore found deep in the Dwarovar, named after Dagrin Everbeard, the legendary first\ndwarf.  Dagrite is prized for its ability to repair itself once electrified, which made it useful\nfor the construction of the Dwarovar Railway due to it requiring little maintenance.\n\n===Ice-Steel===\nA  versatile  variety  of  cold-blue  steel  imbued with the characteristics of ice and freezing\nwater,  Ice-Steel is exclusively produced in the hold of Krakdhûmvror. The exact details of\nits  creation-process  are  kept  a  closely  guarded  secret,  but  it  is known that the hold's\nnamesake  Frozen  Forges  channel  the  biting  cold  of  the  northern winds into a magical\nenergy  that  allows  the  hold's  Ice-Smiths  to create the hold's signature metal. Ice-steel's\nqualities  make  its  applications  versatile,  from  weapons  that  give enemies frostbite and\narrows  that  shatter  into  shrapnel  on impact, to armour that can 'unfreeze' and flow back\ntogether."
 page_events.2475.t: "Metals 3 / 4"
 page_events.2475.d: "\n\n===Kronium===\nAn artificially made dark blue metal, forged by the ancient dwarves to be the heaviest metal\nin  existence  for  the  creation  of  the  Dwarovkron,  to  ensure  that  "whomever rules all\ndwarves   knows   the  weight  of  their  actions".  Apart  from  its  incredible  density  and\nimmovable weight, Kronium doesn't have many useful qualities.\n\n=== Meteoric Silver ===\nA  form  of  silver  found  in Damestear meteorites. Similar appearance to silver but with a\nslightly  bluer  hue.  Conduct  magic  better when mixed with damestear to create an alloy,\nthough results are varied.\n\n===Mithril===\nAlso  known  as  truesilver  or  truemetal,  Mithril was the pinnacle of dwarven metallurgy:\nincredibly light and flexible while retaining the hardness and strength of steel, making it the\nmost  valued  of  all  metals.  However, it is more difficult to produce than more mundane\nmetals,  and  is  exclusively  found in the Serpentspine Mountains, which led to the metal's\nsupply becoming increasingly limited following the fall of Aul-Dwarov.\n\n===Precursor steel===\nAn  ancient  and  magical  metal  once  used  in  the  elven  Precursor Empire. Said to be a\nmixture  of  mithril, steel and damestear, the alloy is known for its excellent ability to store\ntraces  of  magic  without  need of a damestear crystal and more importantly conduct magic\nwithout  becoming  brittle  as  was the norm with damestear alloys. The metal is extremely\nlightweight-yet-durable,   and   said  to  be  slightly  vibrating  if  touched.  Known  for  its\nblueish-grey ripple effect.\n\n===Ramsteel===\nA  variety  of  steel  known  for  its  hardness and durability. Ramsteel was cultivated in the\nSerpentsvale  used  by  the  ancient  Ramsteel  Dwarves,  who  trained their rams to hit the\nheated  metal sheets with their horns while it cooled, hardening it rapidly and more than an\nordinary dwarf could."

 page_events.2476.d: "\n\n===Rosemetal===\nA  rare  ore found only in the mountain ranges of Lorent. Named after its pinkish-red hue,\nthe metal is known for its relatively light weight compared to iron or steel.\n\n===Tearite===\nA steel alloy created with damestear, used in magical applications and enchantment, as well\nas  creation of weapons capable of casting spells. Also known as damestear weapons, tearite\nweapons retain damestear's ability to absorb magical spells, allowing the weapons to absorb\nmagical   spells  and  release  the  built-up  magical  energy  in  combat.  However,  tearite\nweapons  are  often  kept  sheathed  due to risk of damestear overexposure and the negative\nside-effects that entails.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
 page_events.994.t: "Metobesebi 1 / 2"
 page_events.994.d: "\nThe  Metobesebi  are  a Mengi culture group residing in the northeastern part of the Mengi\nregion.  Meaning  'Hundred  families',  the  Metobesebi  land  is  composed  of a hundred\ntight-knit  families  descended  from  legendary  leaders,  prophets, and scholar-heroes that\nfought  and  defeated  countless  enemies  together. Due to this even today, through age-old\nbonds  of  family,  hereditary  friendship  and  family  customs reign important amongst the\npeople.  This  has  also  led  to countless different dialects of the Mengi language that have\nspread  across  the  Meteobesebi  people. One dialect 'warrior' may refer to a male soldier,\nbut  another  dialect  may  have  the same word refer to a female soldier due to an ancestral\nhistory  of women warriors. This has made Metobesebi language excruciatingly difficult for\nforeigners to learn, even so among their Mengi kin.\n\n== Religion ==\nThe  primary  influences of the Metobesebi Myths are the Myth Tablets of Metobesebi that\nare  said  to  have first been written by former followers of Ardimya-That-Was, a genie that\nled  his followers from Bulwar to Ardimya, scattering boons and treasures upon all he met.\nThis  has  created  a  significant  tradition  of  writing  amongst  the  Metobesebi, primarily\npertaining  to  religion  and  law.  It  was  the  Metobesebi that wrote down the basis of the\nMegni  Myths,  their  scribes  derving  codified  governance and teachings from the ancient\ndjinn  manuscripts. When the Raheni came and brought paper and their own script it was a\nwelcome innovation, creating a now-existing mixture of Raheni script and ancient djinn.\n\nAnother  main  influence  on  the  religious  beliefs  of  the  Metobesebi is their geographic\nlocation,  typically  living  in  high  mountains. Believing themselves to living closest to the\nLord  of  the  Sky who manifests in the Sun and Moon, along with all other elements of the\nHeavens, the circular shapes of these celestial objects became ingrained in their beliefs as a\nholy  symbol.  Circular  lip  disks,  circular  earrings,  these  have  become  a  key  part  of\nMetobesebi life, fashion, and religion.\n\n== Customs ==\nA  key  part  of  Metobesebi  culture  is  their terrace farming system that has excelled with\ntime.  Organised  into  terrace  palaces ruled by local lords, the seemingly useless hills and\nmountains  of the northeastern Mengi have been turned into golden treasuries of wheat and\nother  grains.  Even  today  they are a substantial source of food with still-working farms. If\ncut off from obvious sources of water and food, such as river valleys, they sustain."

With\ncountless  unique  vegetables  and fruits, the Metobesebi clans have invented a multitude of\nrecipes such as several different types of red lentil stew.\n\nThough  it  would  spread to all Mengi through repeated Metobesebi victories, the hairstyle\nthat  Mengi  people  are  so  often  known for did in fact originate from this culture. In the\nstyle  of  the  Metobesebi  lions  which  have  black  manes, the people have imitated these\nanimals  in  the  form of their hare. As the terrifying animals attack farmers, labourers, and\nare used to frighten child, the depiction of one can often be used to frighten foreigners too.\nIt  is  believed  by  them  that  a  warrior who has made their hair so will be able to fight as\nfiercely  as  the Metobesebi, or the lions, do. With the fear that this hairstyle inspired, they\nwould come to be known as "dreadlocks".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

 page_events.1008.d: "\nMišari  (Bulwari:  Half-suns)  is  the  name  given to the half-elves born from the union of\nBulwari humans and Sun Elves. Due to the history, and the religious and cultural traditions\nof  the  Bulwari,  half-elves  are  a  rare  sight in Bulwar. It is estimated that the number of\nhalf-elves present in Bulwar during the period 1005-1905 never exceeded 2,000.\n\nSince the Sun Cult affirms that every race is unique, and that each one has a different place\nand  role  in  the  Struggle,  the  existence  of the Mišari puts them in a difficult theological\nposition, since the cult doesn’t recognize the existence of half-races.\n\nThe  marriages between Bulwari and Sun Elves nobilities never reached the same quantities\nthat   Cannor  after  the  Landing,  since  only  a  handful  of  Sun  Elven  families  became\ninfluential, those who had been named governors by Jaher, and the Bulwari nobility had no\ninterest  in  marrying  what  they  saw  as  lowborn.  Marriages  between  human and elven\nlowborn happened, but were low in number.\n\nWhen  the  Council  of  Brasan  established  the  New  Sun  Cult in 1201, the existence of\nhalf-elves  was  made  officially  a  religious  taboo,  but  it is believed that this was an idea\nalready present in Bulwari and Sun Elf society.\n\nThe  Council  of  Eduz-Buranun  in  1216  established  that  half-elves  should  be  sent to\nmonasteries,  either  willingly  or  captured  by  the  Exemplars  or  other  law enforcement\ngroups.  In the monasteries, the Mišari were taught writing, history and theology, and spent\nthe remaining hours of the day in meditation, praying, and gardening, among other activities\nconsidered “pure” by the Sun Cult.\n\nThe  end  goal  of  this  training  was  to  help  the  Mišari  to  attune with one of their two\nheritages, and after a minimum of 13 years of study, and once they have attuned, they must\nparticipate  in  a  ceremony that validates their decision: They are sent in pilgrimage to one\nof the Šednabar, a temple protected by a Lamassu, a highly intelligent and magical creature\nthat  according  to  the  cult was tasked to protect Bulwar by Surael, and then, after a ritual\nbath,  they  must  answer  the  questions  of  the  Lamassu,  who  uses magic to confirm the\nMišari  sincerity.  The ceremony pushes the mind to the limit, and while there are few who\nresist  the  questioning  and manage to pass, most either genuinely succeed or fail. It is said\nthat  a  Mišari  who  passed  the  ceremony  has  a  better  understanding  of himself and is\ndifficult to distract, as it is easier for them to focus their thoughts."
 page_events.2478.t: "Mišari 2 / 2"
 page_events.2478.d: "\n\nAfter  the  ceremony,  they  are  given  a pendant that they must carry all the time, made of\nSihariš, and with a lapis lazuli Sun if they attune with their human heritage, or a gold sun if\nthey attune with their Sun Elf heritage.\n\nA Mišari that completed the ceremony is no longer considered a half-elf, and instead by all\nlegal  and  cultural  matters  they  are  part of the race they attuned. They are able to live a\nmore  normal  life, and while they will still face discrimination in some regions (from both\nhumans  and  sun elves), they are now protected by the law - under a special status of being\n"Purified"  for  any  greater  acts  against  them.  Laws  and  protections  that apply only to\nHumans and Sun Elves will also apply to them, depending on where they have attuned.\n\nIn  the  case of Mišari that attuned with their Sun Elf heritage, they have to vow not to have\nchildren, as to uphold the Sun Cult’s rejection of the existence of half-races.\n\nIf  a  Mišari  refuses  to take part in the attunement ceremony, they are forced to live in the\nmonastery for the rest of their lives, helping retired Sun Elves in the elaboration of incense,\npraying,  performing  ritual cleansings and other activities. On the contrary, if they fail they\nare  given the choice of staying in the monastery as a servant or as a laborer as penitence, or\nto abandon Bulwar.\n\nThe severity of the punishment of a Mišari that breaks the vow to not have children, or that\nhas  a  half-elf  children  depends  on  the state, with some places the sentence being death,\nwhile  in  others  can  be  banishment  of  Bulwar,  but  in general they are sent back to the\nmonastery  and  the  other parent is imprisoned and judged according to the law. While the\nMišari  is  treated  equally as someone who failed the ceremony, their child is educated and\ngiven  the  chance  of  taking  it,  as  is  treated  as  a half-elf, even if the other parent was a\nhuman.\n\nWhile  the  Mišari  faced  discrimination  in all of Bulwar during the 200 years of the New\nSun Cult existence, there are only a few episodes of persecution against them, most notably\nthe  one  in  Birsartanšes  in  1456, after the end of the Našra war.

Morganne was the only child of sil Kyliande of\nthe Upper Bloodwine and thus was groomed to inherit the duchy.\n\nSince  the arrival of the Remnant Fleet carrying the elves in 1000, Cannor has changed, the\nUpper  Bloodwine not spared of that change. The Lorenti began to adopt the culture of the\nElves,  and  as  Beltram  and  Morganne  grew  up their two families drifted apart from the\nchange.  Morganne’s  family  emulated  the  elves,  while Beltram’s remained proud of their\nLorenti  culture.  Morganne often found herself presented before elves and was expected to\nemulate  their  behavior.  Despite  the  growing  gulf  between  the families, Morganne and\nBeltram  were  bound  together  to  strengthen  the  dynasty: in case of death leaving one of\nthem as head of the family, they were to be married.\n\nGrowing up during the War of the Sorcerer King was a tumultuous time: their parents told\nthem  of  a  great  battle  upriver  at  Lorentaine  in  1000,  spooking  them  by  saying  the\nBloodwine  turned  the  same  color  as  it’s  namesake. While Beltram was gone at war his\nfamily’s  lands were left to his mother: who quickly fell sick. Without a lord overseeing the\nland,  Morganne  was  tasked  by  her father to administer it. While she was at the court in\nPalevine,   her   father  fell  in  an  accident  that  many  believe  was  intentional  murder.\nMorganne ruled the Upper Bloodwine for nearly two years before Beltram arrived home in\n1019.

Morganne was apprehensive about the return of\nBeltram:  he  was different from the boy she fell in love with, mean and resentful. She also\nfelt  threatened  that  her rule over the duchy was questioned by her betrothed, when before\nshe could make her own decisions. Meanwhile the war was approaching its end, with more\nof  the  Lorentish  men  returning.

She  claimed  that  the  duchy  was  her  birthright as\ndaughter  of  the  late duke, and that as ruler of the duchy she had full authority over whom\nshe could marry.\n\nThe  Queen-Regent  Ioriel  has  so  far mediated the peace between the quarrelling couple.\nThe  two  sides  have  fortified  their  holdings  over  the  Upper Bloodwine, almost clearly\nseparated  between  the old Lorenti and the elven-aligned Lorentish.

 page_events.1022.d: "\nMother  Akasik  is  the  henotheistic religion of the Akasi humans of Northwestern Sarhal.\nWhile  exact traditions vary across the region, the core belief is that the Mother is both the\nliteral  and spiritual representation of the Akasik Mountains cradling her followers through\ntheir  lives.  While some religions claim that the genies are each from a separate elemental\nplane,  the  Akasi  believe  in  only a single elemental plane which is the source of divinity.\nJust  as  the  four  primary  aspects compose Mother Akasik -- just as our plane is home to\nmany  gods  who  interact and disagree -- there is only one source of divinity outside of our\nrealm, but many manifestations of that divinity.\n\n== The Manifesting of Aspects ==\nThe  primary  means  of  worship in Mother Akasik is the aspectual celebration of the 12th\nSummer  Solstice.  Every  dozen  years  on  the  20th  of Suren, the Manifesting of Aspects\noccurs,  during  which  it  is  traditional  to  splash  water,  dance,  and  recite poetry. This\ncelebration  marks  the transition from the focus of one aspect of Mother Akasik to another\nwhich  will then hold prominence for the next 12 years. Because it takes 48 years for a full\ncycle  to  complete, the Manifesting of Aspects is also a time of reflection on the passing of\nhuman life. Not all of those celebrating will live to see the passing aspect celebrated again.\n\n=== Aspect of Justice ===\nThe celebration of the Mother’s justice is marked by a willingness to act. During this dozen\nyear  period, the Akasi are more strict in upholding the common law both upon themselves\nand upon others. This dozen year period often sees a swell in military service as worshipers\ncompel  themselves  to  right  past wrongs. However, this also tends to increase diplomatic\ntensions as the Akasi are less willing to compromise on matters of moral imperative.\n\n=== Aspect of Resilience ===\nThe  celebration  of  the  Mother’s  resilience  is marked by a steadfast resolve. During this\ndozen  year  period, the Akasi tend to behave more stubbornly in their aspectual adoration.\nIt  is  not  advised  to  wage  war  against them at this time if it can be avoided, as besieged\nAkasi  have  been  known  to hold out until the last man starves rather than concede defeat.\nWhile  this  stubbornness  has  its  benefits,  celebration  of  resilience  has  been known to\npresage  “dark”  decades  where  the  arts  are  stymied,  because there is less willingness to\nengage in new ideas, preferring instead to rely on tradition."
 page_events.2480.t: "Mother Akasik 2 / 4"
 page_events.2480.d: "\n\n=== Aspect of Compassion ===\nThe  celebration  of  the  Mother's  compassion  is marked by social openness. During this\ndozen  year  period,  the  Akasi seek out charitable opportunities and abstain from violence\nunless  in  self-defense or the defense of others. The gnollish invasions have been known to\ndisrupt the calm that otherwise distinguishes this period from the others. Generally, though\nthe  celebration  of  compassion  is  a  time  for letting one's guard down and attempting to\nbetter understand the motivations of one's enemies.\n\n=== Aspect of Reciprocity ===\nThe  celebration  of the Mother's reciprocity is marked by trade opportunities. During this\ndozen  year  period,  the  Akasi actively seek out the ideas of others ranging anywhere from\nthe banal to the outright heretical. Though the interchange of ideas should not be mistaken\nwith  the  acceptance  of  opposing view points, the open sharing of otherwise incompatible\nbeliefs  has  led  to  frequent  social innovation during this time. This is also the time when\nmost  trade  deals  are established in Akasi culture and new trade routes sought out. Due to\nthe  increased  travel  and  argumentation  of ideas, this also tends to give way to periods of\ninstability, especially leading into the celebration of justice when wrongs are expected to be\nrighted.\n== Creation Myth ==\nIn  the elemental plane beyond time, there existed a unified will and the many servants who\nattended  to its needs. The unified will yearned to create, but, outside of time, creation was\nimpossible  as all that ever could be both already was and already would be. So, the unified\nwill  projected  itself  into  our  plane  of  existence.  In  doing so, it was split into the four\nembodied elements and so were the servants split into efreet, djinn, marid, and dao.\n\nAt first this brought conflict as the embodied elements each struggled against the autonomy\nof  the  others.  This conflict gave rise to the continents, the oceans, the skies, and the sun,\neach fighting for supremacy. Eventually, seeing the wonders that each had made, they found\ncommon purpose in their original desire to create."

Second, air made the same attempt, but the result was\ntoo  ephemeral and dissipated just as quickly. Third, water created a being more solid than\nthe  first  two,  but it could not hold its shape and washed away just the same. Finally, earth\ncreated  its own semblance and this was able to hold its shape. In this way, the embodiment\nof  earth  became  the  Mother  of  primordial  man  and  Akasik  their  place of birth. But\nprimordial  man  was  unthinking  and  unliving.  In  response,  the  other  three embodied\nelements joined with the embodiment of earth. The embodiment of fire provided the spark\nof   intellect  and  emotion.  The  embodiment  of  air  provided  the  breath  of  life.  The\nembodiment of water provided the coursing blood to convey life to intellect and vice versa.\nThese three together within the vessel of earth brought about humanity as it is known today.\nSatisfied  with  their  creation, the four embodied elements ceased their projection into our\nrealm.\n\nDuring  this  time,  the genie servants developed a will and freedom of their own. They did\nnot  possess  the  original  will  to create and so warred against one another without end. In\nthe  absence  of the embodied elements, the genies created gnolls and elves and every other\nbeing  and  animal  as a mockery of humankind. Unsatisfied, they next enslaved humans as\nthe  genies  developed  their  own unifying desire: to rule without subservience. The genies\nwarred  for uncountable millennia with the djinn establishing a hegemony across the world.\nIn their victory, the djinn banished the efreet, the marid, and the dao back to the elemental\nplane.  This  was  their  downfall, though, as the unified will recognized the imbalance and\nprojected  itself  once  more  into  our plane in a great reckoning that ended the rule of the\ndjinn  and  prevented  their further projection into our plane. Thus, the terror of the genies\ncame to an end.\n\nStill,  the  unified  will  occasionally  projects  itself  into  our  plane  to ensure humanity's\ncontinued  success. It is these periodic bursts that create the planetouched as the embodied\nelements are temporarily in disharmony upon projection. Similarly, the gods of Halann are\ntruly individual within our plane, but they are all projections of the unified will. Humanity\ncan  never  truly  be  unified  with  the Mother as they are beings of a separate plane. They\nmust strive for unity in all things so that they might better understand her nature."

It is\noften regarded as somewhat faster than its predecessor, but with less stamina.\n\n====Lencori Charger====\n\nFound  in  the  Southern Flats of Lencenor, with the best of breed said to be from Enteben,\nthe  Lencori  Charger  is  the  favored  warhorse of the Kingdom of Lorent. It is known for\nbeing  an  excellent  all-around  breed,  with  a  balance of strength, speed and stamina that\nmakes it a solid choice for any battle.\n\n====Lencori Palfrey====\n\nOriginally  from  the  Shrouded  Coast,  the  Lencori  Palfrey is the favorite riding horse of\nmuch  of the Cannorian nobility for its smooth, ambling gait that makes it easy to ride over\nlong distances.\n\n====Ording Workhorse====\n\nA  working  horse with excellent stamina, the Ording Workhorse is common in the western\nplains  of  Lencori,  particularly  the Northern Flats of its namesake Duchy of Ording.

Originally created in the Kingdom of Farraneán, the breed\nwas  largely  confined  to  Ibevar  after  the  Greentide.  While  it  often takes a few human\nlifetimes  to  learn  to  get  along  with  them, those who have find a bold mount that won't\nflinch  at  the shot of a gun, and can easily outmaneuver other breeds in dense forests, steep\nvalleys, and other rough terrain seen in its native land.\n\n====Roysfort Thoroughbred====\n\nA  small,  but  quite  fast,  horse  favored  by  the  Redfoot  halflings  and common in both\nhorseracing and among messenger services.\n\n==== Newshire Horse ====\nPopular  Escanni  workhorse  first bred in Newshire, large horse with a black coat and long\nmane.

It is widely regarded\nas  the  fastest  horse  in  its region, popular in both Salahad and Cannor, but has difficulty\nwith armored riders and so is only suitable for light cavalry.\n\n==== Kumarkandi Draft Horse ====\nFamed  for  both  their  incredible strength and incredible stubbornness, Kumarkandi draft\nhorses  are  prized  workhorses  for  farming, however infamously hard to work with. Most\ncommonly used in bulwar.\n\n==== Avamezan Purebred ====\nWhen  the  sun elves landed in Bulwar, they brought their horses with them. Many of these\nnoble  beasts  marched  east with Jaher, but some remained in Bulwar. One breed of horse\nthat  descended  from those creatures are the Avamezan Purebred, the steeds of the nobility\nof Sareyand. They are famed for their speed, strength and fearlessness on the battlefield.\n\n==== Mašnsih Desert Horse ====\nA  horse  breed  from  the  eastern  Salahad,  it  is  known  for being well adapted for faster\nmovement  over  long  distances  and  to  the  arid  climate  of the desert. These horses are\ngood-natured  and  quick  to  learn.

With a size rivalling that of a\ndraft  horse and antlers bigger and sturdier than an adult stag’s, much of the Ynnic economy\nis  devolved  to  sustaining  these  great beasts, and it is said that along with their royal-like\nmajesty comes a pickiness and attitude rivalling that of the lords riding them.\n\nOriginally  native  to  the  northern  forests of Dolindha, they were exported to Sarda lands\nduring Ynnic Empire times, and were bred to be smaller and more manageable through the\ncenturies,  though huge feral antler horses can still be found deep within Drevkenuc. Their\ntaming  is  attributed  to  the  legendary  figure  of Lukaus from the turn of the first century\nAfter  Ash.  In  many tales surrounding Lukaus, Ynnic Antler Horses are portrayed as being\nable  to  talk,  and  choose  their riders based on the nobleness of their hearts while fiercely\nresisting any attempts to be ridden by the unworthy.\n\n==== Epednar Crossbreed ====\nA  hybrid  between  the  Dolindhan  antler horse of the forests and the lightweight Epednar\nhorse  of the prairies, the Epednar Crossmount is a midweight horse with long, single-point\nantlers  that  fall  off  and regrow at a quick rate. While lacking the raw power of an Antler\nHorse,  they  have  greater agility and endurance. Popular in Arganjuzorn, other Dolindhan\nlords consider such mounts outlandish.\n\n==== Tipney Runner ====\nDescended  from  the Roysfort Thoroughbred, the (West) Tipney Runner is potentially the\nfastest  breed  of  horse to ever dash across the forests and fields of the Ynn, possibly fastest\nin  the  world.  Most  commonly  used by the Pipefoot halflings, also popular in Tellumtir.\nExcellent for messanger services, races, scouts, and yeehaw."

It is resistant to\nthe heat and insects, with short manes and thick, porous skin.\n\n==== Larankarha Hill Horse ====\nThese  horses  are  strong,  nimble,  and  fleet of foot, traits said to be a result of mountain\ngoat blood running through their veins.\n\n== Mythical Horses ==\n\n=== Enteben Unicorn ===\n\n=== Pegasi ===\n\n== Camels ==\nCamels  are used as cavalry alongside horses in the regions neighboring the Salahad desert.\nIn  Kheterata,  they  are  used  as  regular  units,  while  in  Far Bulwar they are commonly\nassociated  with  the  Mašnsih  tribes  and  the  rangers  using them as mounts to secure the\ncaravan routes crossing the desert."

It was formed following the death\nof  Jexis  in  1162  and  the ensuing collapse of the Phoenix Empire. Lasting approximately\n300 years, its end was brought by its sister matriarchy of Elayenna in 1453.\n\n==History==\n===Origin===\nFollowing   the   collapse   of  the  Harpylen  Queendom,  several  flocks  led  by  Siaduna\nFlaming-Talon  fled  east,  eventually settling in what is now the Šad Siadan mountains and\nlater  becoming  Siadunan  Harpies.  By  800  the harpies had organized into the Siadanlen\nQueendom which later at their height controlled most of the Far Salahad and Rakhadesh.\n\nAfter  the  fall  of  Siadanlen,  when  Jaher’s armies invaded the area in what’s known as the\nSundering  of  Siadanlen,  the  northern  Siadunan  flocks  grew distant from their southern\nsisters.  The  Siadunan  Harpies  remained  a part of the Phoenix Empire until the death of\nJexis in 1162.\n\n===Founding of Mulen===\nIn  the  wake  of  Jexis’  death,  the  Siadunan  Harpies  broke  free  of the Phoenix Empire\nforming  three  queendoms:  Mulen,  Siadan,  and  Elayenna.  Mulen  was  founded  by the\nnorthern  Siadunan  flocks  and  was  named  after  Mula  Swift-Sparrow,  granddaughter of\nSiaduna  Flaming-Talon.  The  matriarchy  was  guided  by  her  teachings  of cooperation,\npersuasion, and diplomacy.\n\n=== Annexation by Elayenna===\nBy  1453  Mulen  and  Siadan  were  both  subjugated  by  Elayenna  with support from the\nJaddari  Legion  following  their victory against Sareyand. The Muleni adapted to The Jadd\nwith  relative  ease  due  to  their philosophy of cooperation and tolerance.

This openness to strangers\nwould  go on to be celebrated and immortalized in an annual holiday prevalent in Anbennar\nand beyond: Lansday.\n\n==War of the Sorcerer King==\nAuci  explained  to  Munas  that  while  the elves were welcome to reside within the Isle of\nDamesear,  the  rest  of  the continent was embroiled in a conflict known as the War of the\nSorcerer  King  and  that she and a cadre of warriors were leaving for Lorent to aid in their\nliberation.

The  Renaissance period showed increasing freedom from\nmedieval  constraints  as  people  began  to  research  more into the cultural history of both\nDameria  and  Castanor, with more variety in range, rhythm, harmony, form, and notation.\nThis  wasn't  a  retread  of  ancient  ideas  and movements, but a new movement born from\nthose  ideas,  taking  ancient  conventions  and  relating  them to the modern day. Not only\nancient  conventions  and  styles,  but  classical  instruments  were  tinkered  with  as  well,\nforming  new  sounds  and  instrumentation,  such  as  the  Giberdi  basoon, and even early\nversions of the guitar.\n\nThis  was  also  the  birth  of  regular  use  of sheet music, with songs spreading further and\nfaster  than  ever  before!  And  they  were  needed too, as a larger influx of Troubadors was\ntraveling  the  continent than in previous centuries. With the Greentide and the collapse of\nEscann,  Troubadors  from  the  Escanni courts were traveling far and wide, spreading these\nmusical  styles  with  them. This made it catch on quicker than music had ever before, and\nthis quick spread would continue throughout the centuries.\n\n=== The Badarazi Period: 1540-1630 ===\nInfluences from the Greentide were more than just blood and battle. Although many would\nbe  loathe to admit it, orcish culture began to seep into certain areas, though in many cases\nit  wasn't  truly  popular  until  someone  else  took  the style and adapted it for Cannorian\naudiences.  Such  was  the  case  during  the Badarazi period, where the Verne Camerata, a\ngroup of poets and musicians, began producing new music using common-practice tonality,\nor  writing  a  piece  in  a  particular  key.  This  caught on very fast, and even more orcish\ninfluences  filled  in  soon  after,  such as the introduction of the powerful driving bassline.\nMusic  also  became  larger,  with  the  creation  of  the orchestra.

The orc responded\n"Bada-orazi",  which  means  "New  Song",  as  in  he  had  not  named  the song yet. The\nVernman,  not  knowing  orcish  very  well,  liked  the name and used it from that moment\nonward as a name for this style of music, which was quickly picked up by others.\n\n=== The Silnar Period: 1630-1725 ===\nBy the early 1600s Badarazi music was falling out of style for many reasons. It had become\noverly  complex  and hard to digest. Many powers of Cannor stumbled, facing defeats from\na  united  Small  Country  and  other  threats, and the orchestral sound of Badarazi became\nassociated  with  Witch  Kings and tyrants. In contrast a new movement quickly swept into\nthe  hearts  and  minds  of  Cannorians,  featuring  a return to simplicity and immediacy of\nappeal.  This  movement was spearheaded by many halfling bards who's music caught on at\nthis time, a large influx of them from the recently free Small Country.\n\nThe  name  means  "Of  Paradise",  as  these  pieces  were  simpler,  with  more  song-like\nmelodies, and carried concepts of uplifting paradise, even in the bleakest times. This music\nwas  not  as  much  court  music  as  it  was city music. After the style was solidified in the\nSmall  Country more unique styles came out of the many republics across Cannor, inspired\nby  their  lives  and  living  spaces,  carrying strong emotions that carried across easier than\nmusic from earlier periods\n\n=== The Passionate Period: 1725-1830 ===\nWith   the  embrace  of  Enlightenment  ideals,  music  began  to  change  and  evolve  into\nsomething  brand  new,  a  new  movement  that  took  the emotional intimacy of the Silnar\nPeriod and ran with it. The ever-decreasing cost of print and the spread of publications and\nliteracy  to  the  masses invigorated the music industry, and as a result, music became more\nindividualistic, emotional, dramatic, and often filled with a narrative beyond just the sound\nof  the music. As new bright minds popped up all over Cannor, new music popped up with\nthem, inspired by all the great literature, art, and mechanical wonders of the period. It was\nalso often quite sarcastic and artistic; many older races found it very obnoxious."

She organized a conclave within the relative safety of\nElynáile  in  Salla Elyn, and summoned all clan leaders to attend regardless of alliances and\nrelations.  By  1442  AA, clan leaders and emissaries from all remaining clans had arrived.\nThe talks almost instantly led to infighting and bickering due to the tense relations between\nmany  of  the  clans.

In a risky gambit, Narawen tells Ceanna Alara Cenág\nabout   the   location   of   the  fugitives  and  of  Arun,  her  brothers  alleged  killer.  The\nconfrontation  led to Alara being convinced of Aruns innocence, the importance of keeping\nthe conclave going and that they should let Corin's party escape to defeat the Eldest.\n\n=== Verdant Pact ===\nWith  the support Alara Cenág, Narawen managed to salvage the conclave and the creation\nof  an  alliance  between all Sallas of the Deepwoods. This alliance was named the Verdant\nPact,  and  consisted  of almost all remaining Sallas.

It was an isolated\nnation  with  its  only  neighbours being Bjarnrik and Revrhavn. The Trolls were ruled by a\nmatriarch who governed from the old giant's fortress of Murtrhol.\n\n==The Chiefdom of Obrtrol==\n===Origins===\nThe  Trolls  that inhabited Obrtrol are believed to have been originally created by the Frost\nGiants  (or  so  they  claim) in a place they refer to as Hjyrrtsikki believed to be located in\nthe  Northern Pass in east Grombar however there is still scholarly debate over whether the\nTrolls  of Obrtrol are unique in that regard or share an origin with other Trolls. Regardless\nof  their  origin  the  trolls  served  the  Giants until the prehistoric war of the Dragons and\nGiants  which  resulted  in  the burning of the Giants mountain fortresses and the ending of\nThe  Ice  Age  on  Halann.  This also resulted in most of the Giants drowning in the newly\ncreated  Giants  Grave  Sea.  The  event  also  lead to an intense fear of the ocean in Fjord\nTrolls which lasted until around the 14th century.\n\n===Early History===\nFor  most  of  the  Trolls  early  history  they served as the retainers and servants of Giants.\nFollowing  the  prehistoric  war  between  the  Giants  and  Dragons  and the decline of the\npopulation  of their masters the Trolls quickly became the last defenders of Gerud's realm.\nThis  was  until  Jormir  Once-Thawed  brought back the rule of Frost Giants over most of\nGerudia  in  570BA. Jormir was feared by Castanoth however his reign was peaceful and it\nwas  not  until  Jormir  was slain by his brother Kranmas that the wars of Giantsbane broke\nout  with  ended  in  the  giants  defeat  in  357BA.  By 373BA the Castanorian legions had\nbegun   invading   Gerudia   and   slaughtering  many  Giants  and  Trolls.  Afterwards  the\nGerudians  began  colonising  much  of the Trolls former lands such as the Dalr Valley and\nall along the river Rafn this was until The Day of Ashen Skies. The Day of Ashen Skies saw\nmuch  less  destruction  in  Gerudia than most of the world however it was recorded by the\nGerudians  as  the  bloodiest  Troll  invasion  since  the  reign  of the Giants.

This Troll\ndominance   over  Western  Gerudia  ended  sometime  between  882-907  when  Bera  the\nfounder  and  first  queen  of Bjarnrik united the Gerudians tribes against the Trolls forcing\nthem back to the Dalrfjall Mountains.\n\n===Modern (Work in Progress)===\nInvasion by Bjarnrik?\n\nInvasion by Northern League?\n\n===Culture===\nThe  Trolls  of Obrtrol were distinct from their Forest troll and Swamp troll siblings by the\nfact  that  they  were  more  organised.  They even differed from many other Frost Trolls in\nthat  regard, as they were a union of numerous clans. They were the only force of organised\nTroll  resistance  against  Gerudian  colonisation  and  had a rather primitive but organised\nsociety.  There  were  also attempts by the Fjord Trolls to mimic human culture by wearing\nfurs  and  jewellery  however it is not know how much they understood the meaning behind\nit.  The  most  significant hallmark of Fjord Troll culture was slavery which served as a way\nto  acquire  food  to  eat  and  a  way  to acquire fresh workers for the mines. Most of these\nslaves were captured Gerudians from raids. (Also they had mammoths)\n\n===After Occupation (Work in Progress/May not be Canon)===\nAfter  the  trolls  subjugation  by Bjarnrik they were treated brutally with a mass purging of\ntroll  masters  with  only  some  surviving,  after  the initial conflict however the Gerudians\nfound  a use for the remaining trolls as wardens and masters of prisoner colonies and mines\nin Dalrfjall."

Originally the\nGebahiri,  Harimar's  rise  to power in 35 AA would bring about a wake of exile's escaping\nthe  rise  of  his  Harimraj  and  its  wars.  Fleeing  south, to the northeastern coastlands of\neastern  Sarhal,  the Raheni exiles fled to their longtime trading parts of the Gebahiri cities\n(some  of  which  were even founded by Raheni merchants ages ago). Through centuries of\nintermingling,  the  Ofehibi  were  born,  a culture known for their philosophically-minded\ntendencies and openness towards new ideas.\n\n== Slavery ==\nAmongst  the  Mengi  the  Ofehibi  were  in  a  particularly  advantageous  position  as  the\nmiddlemen  of  the  greater  slave  trade.  Beginning  with gnollish caravans bringing slaves\nfrom  places such as Tijarikhet, Bulwar, or occasionally even faraway Fangaula and Cannor\nwho  then  sell them to Ofehibi traders, the Ofehibi slave-traders in turn act as the primary\nsource  for  slaves  bound  for  sale  to the rest of the Mengi (whose economy is built upon\nforeign slaves) and across the gulf to Rahen.\n\n== Military ==\nThe  Ofehibi  were  known  for their extensive military, notably their defense, both on land\nand  on  sea.  Likely  stemming from their location on the forefront against the Yezel Mora\nShadowswamps,  the  Ofehibi  were  the  first  line  of defence and frequently known as the\nguardians against the primary threat to the "holy kingdom" is the Mengi.\n\nRiverforts are one particular strategy utilized by the Ofehibi due to the vast amount of trade\nthat is conducted along the river. These forts excel in protecting the waterways and crossing\npoints  that  line their rivers along with being able to function as tollways for passing vessels\nand marketplaces for visiting merchants.\n\nIn regards to the piracy that was rampant across the Gulf of Rahen, due to both pirates and\nRaheni  privateers,  Ofehibi merchants outfitted their dhow vessels with sets of swivel guns.\nTheir  little weight allowed a quick placement anywhere needed on the ship. If a dhow was\nengaged,  it  often  used  its  small  size  and  superior  maneuverability  to  score effective,\ndisabling hits on an enemy's sails and rigging, allowing a quick escape."

It  is  well  believed by the Ofehibi that simply wearing the\nturban assists to ingratiate oneself to the native Raheni merchants they often deal with.\n\nA favourite, if morbid, folktale among the Ofehibi is that of the gnoll who was a young and\neager  slaver  with  a  mind  set  to  make a fortune. After his first successful slave raid, the\ngnoll  ordered  his  caravan’s  navigator  to plot a route to the Ofehibi and upon arrival was\nfurious at the sight of the “roundheads”, who he mistook as Raheni.

 page_events.1065.t: "Ogre 1 / 3"
 page_events.1065.d: "\nOgres  are  a  humanoid race primarily located in the Ogre Valley of the Forbidden Plains,\nand the Demon Hills of Yanshen. Physically they appear similar to humans, albeit standing\nan  average of 3 meters tall. Befitting such a stature, Ogres are renowned for their strength.\nThey   are   most  known  for  their  voracious  appetites  and  willingness  to  eat  anything\n(including  each other). Emulating their giant forefathers, civilized ogres tend to congregate\nin large fortified settlements.\n\n==Origins==\nKnowledge  of  Ogres  extends  back into the Cannorian Creation Myth, wherein they were\ncreated  by  the True Giants alongside the trolls to assist with the shaping of Halann. In the\naftermath  of  the  giant's defeat in the Inheritance War, the ogres turned against their gods,\nhunting  and  eating  them  for sustenance. After this betrayal, the ogres would splinter into\nthe various ethnic groups known today.\n\nAlthough  both  trolls  and  ogres  were  created  by the true giants, recent studies have cast\ndoubt  on  the  idea  that  the  three  are biologically related. In particular, the inability for\nogres  and  trolls  to  produce  viable  offspring  together  suggests  that  they  descend from\ncompletely  different  ancestors.  Furthermore,  the  ability  for  ogres  and orcs to produce\nviable  female  offspring  lends  credence  to the theory that ogre biology contributed to the\ncreation of the orcs.\n\n==Ethnic Groups==\n*Fathide  Ogre:  The  Fathide  are  the most numerous of the ogre cultures, centered in the\nstate  of Maghargma in the Ogre Hills of the eastern Forbidden Plains. Their skin typically\ncomes  in lighter flesh tones, though some are born with tinges of gray or green. Among the\nogre groups, the Fathide are on average built the largest and most muscular.\n*Horned  Ogre:  More commonly referred to as the Oni, the Horned Ogres stand out from\ntheir  peers  on  account  of  their  red  skin  and  pupil-less  eyes,  which local superstition\nattributes  to  demonic  possession.  Their  population  is  centered  in  the  Shirgrii  of the\nDemon  Hills  in Yanshen. At its height, The Command subjugated the Oni and used them\nto  garrison  any  temples  that  fell under their control.NOTE: The official position of the\nOrder  of  Chroniclers regarding the Rending of Realms is that the Oni who contributed to\nthe  event  were  independent  actors  unaffiliated  with  the  Shirgrii.  The  written records\npossessed  by  the Horned Ogres dating back to potentially before Precursor civilization are\ninvaluable,  and  chronicler  access  is  predicated  on  good  relationships  with  the record\nkeepers."

With leaner builds and prominent tusks, ancient Bulwari art depicts\nthem  as  possessing  an  appearance  more  similar  to  Halessi  ogres than any northern or\nwestern  varieties.  They  are  frequently  referenced  as  being  used as slaves to the Djinn,\nprimarily  tasked  with  enforcing  Djinni rule over the humans of the region, earning them\nthe  name  of  Ašigallu,  or  man-eater  demons.  In  addition  to their servitude, they were\nmagically   fortified   to   be   near-impervious   to  physical  effects.  Nearly  all  traces  of\nDjinnbound  ogres  vanish  at  some  point  in  the mid-17th century BA. Historians of the\nregion  point  to  the  folk  tale  of  “Ninarzeg,  the  Bringer  of Death,” wherein a vengeful\ngod-queen  unleashes  a pestilence against an ancient foe. She succeeds, but at the cost of a\nquarter of her subjects\n*Mossmouth Ogre: The Mossmouth Ogres originally called the flooded swamplands of the\nSerpent's  Vale  Vale  home;  however,  many can also be found in Maghargma following a\nmass  exodus  after  the collapse of a short-lived Kingdom of Ghavamregh. It is commonly\nbelieved  that  the  Mossmouth  Ogres  descend from the last remnants of the Swamp ogres\nthat  were  able to flee the purges instigated by Castan VI Giantsbane. They typically stand\n1-2 feet smaller than their Fathide cousins, and possess green-toned skin.\n*Sandmaw  Ogre:  An extinct variation of Ogres that were once found throughout the south\nof  the Forbidden Plains. Following mass starvation in the wake of the Day of Ashen Skies,\nthey were driven to attack the centaur population for food out of desperation. The resultant\ncentaur  retaliation  would  lead  to  the  complete extinction of their culture. Though once\nbelieved   to   have   lived   exclusively  in  nomadic  hordes,  Triunic  archaeologists  have\ndiscovered  artifacts  suggesting  the  early stages of Sandmaw permanent settlements on the\nbanks  of  the  Upper  Serpent’s  Gift. What few records and histories exist suggest that the\nSandmaws possessed darker flesh-toned skin.\n*Swamp  Ogre:  Another  extinct variation of ogres that lived in the forests and boglands of\nCannor,   mostly   surrounding   Bal  Mire.  Following  the  Giantsbane  War,  Castan  VI\nGiantsbane  instigated  a purge of trolls and ogres within his domain. What written records\ndo  exist of the Swamp Ogres are highly skewed to portray them as monstrous, but it can be\nsurmised  that  the  typical  Swamp  Ogre  possessed  green skin. There is no evidence of a\nSwamp Ogre civilization, and most probably lived alone or with immediate family."

It is additionally a major supplier of iron and\nother  metals  to  the  rest  of  the  Forbidden  Plains. Pre-industrial Ogrish society heavily\nutilized  slavery,  but  slavery  on  a  large  scale  fell out of use as the Valley industrialized.\nOgrish   customs   of   congregating   in   kelaktars   contributed   to   an  abnormally  high\nurbanization rate, which made the region ripe for industrialization.\n\n==Demographics==\nThe  population of the Valley is overwhelmingly Fathide Ogre, and has been for millennia.\nA  sizable  minority  of  Mossmouth Ogres exists within the region as well, having migrated\nfrom the Serpent’s Vale en masse.

Consequently,  what little centaur tribute that Magharagma still controlled fell\nto  a  centuries-long  low.

In  response,  the  Mengur’m  issued  a\nproclamation  granting  full recognition and royal support for any ogres who would migrate\neast and settle the frontier. The promises were empty ones, intended to thin the population\nof  Mahargma  proper,  but  nonetheless  effective.  Starving and desperate ogres manage to\nestablish  fortified  settlements  under  constant centaur attacks, surpassing all expectations.\nImpressed by their fortitude, the Mengur’m grants their leader the name “Strongrock.”\n* The already-established Stoneheart tribe remains steadfastly loyal, and plays a crucial role\nin  protecting  the  northern  border  of  Maghargma  proper  from roving bands looking to\npillage  the  more  developed  capital  region.  Furthermore,  they  were  entrusted with the\nprotection of the Valak river, being granted the trading Kelaktar of Krotushtef.\n*  The  Steelgrinder  family  within  the wealthy kelaktar of Olkhalebur seize control of the\nmajority of mining and smelting operations within the city amidst the chaos. Where before\nindividual   firms   were  supplying  weapons  to  whomever  had  the  coin  for  them,  the\nSteelgrinders  were  quick to sign an exclusive arms deal with the capital in exchange for an\nexpanded domain and monopoly rights on Olkhalebur iron.\n*  The  Chainlords  of  Onathalkir  would  similarly  seek to carve out their own monopoly\namidst  the  flames;  but  instead of iron, they would make their fortunes from flesh. While\nmany   of  the  other  ogre  tribes  were  busy  fighting  each  other,  the  Chainlord  family\nconstructed  a  massive  slave  trading  scheme.  Tribes  low  on  manpower  could  buy the\nservices  of  the  many  slave  armies  of  the  Chainlords  in  exchange  for transferring the\nownership  of all the buyer’s slaves to the Chainlords. The land allotted to Achtejardon was\nnot  conquered  by  the  Chainlords  during  the  Bloodletting,  but  instead  was purchased\ndirectly from the crown in the aftermath.\n*  The  kelaktars  in  the  northern reaches of the kingdom faced near total depopulation as\ntheir  food  supplies  continued  to  dwindle.  When  it  seemed  as if all would be lost, the\ntypically   reclusive  and  outcast  tribe  of  zealots  known  as  the  Doomhungers  made  a\nproclamation  to  the surrounding kelaktars; their stores and silos would be open to all who\nwould accept their authority and rededicate themselves to a life of piety and preservation of\ntheir  souls.

When Korgus died, orcs across the world\nlost  this  ability,  even  those  unaffiliated with Korgus himself such as those brown orcs in\nHaless.

This  even  extends  to gender roles; orcs do not care\nabout gender regarding one's role in society's hierarchy or rulership. In the end, strength is\nwhat matters.\n\nDue to their respect for strength, many orcs can be seen following non-orcish leaders, such\nas  powerful  warlords  or  mages  -  perhaps  not out of loyalty or love, but out of fear and\nobedience:  if  anything,  it is the orcish people's overwhelming respect of strength that can\nkeep them in line. On the other hand, non-orcs can sometimes be seen within orcish tribes\nand  clans,  especially  since  the  decline  of  the  orcish  clans  in the 17th century, as any\nindividual  strong  enough  to  earn  a  place  in  the tribe is welcome and is said to have an\norcish soul.\n\n\n===Honor, and adversity against Trickery===\nContrary to popular belief the orcish people are a people of honor, or at the least, honor to\ntheir  own  code of ethics. In general, they are known to abhor trickery and deceit (as their\nracial  deity,  the  Great  Dookan,  was  deceived  and  imprisoned  by  the other gods) and\ngenerally avoid actions such as slaying of non-combatants, assassinations or intrigue."

 page_events.2520.d: "\n\nDepending  on  the orc's interpretation of this tradition, moral compass, or subservience to\na  certain  leader's  ethos,  the  slaying  of  non-combatants  can and have resulted in widely\ndifferent  outcomes.  Some  stories in the Greentide talk of orcs showing mercy to even the\nmost  reviled  orc-hunting  adventurer for simply throwing down their weapon, whilst other\naccounts   talk  of  more  severe  circumstances,  like  a  subjugated  town  being  razed  by\naffiliation due to the actions of rogue guardsmen.\n\nAmbushes   and   other  under-handed  military  tactics  are  tolerated,  but  regarded  as  a\nnecessary evil and only utilized against willing or identified combatants such as soldiers.\n\nOddly  enough, theft in form of pillaging does not constitute as trickery, as it is seen simply\nas  the  strong  taking  what  is  rightfully  theirs.  This broad idea extends beyond material\npossessions,  such  as titles, mates and territory. Thievery through guile and trickery, on the\nother  hand,  is  frowned  upon  greatly,  and,  if anything, were left to the goblins that were\nsubservient to the clans.\n\n===Wealth and Materials Goods===\nStrength  is  such  an  important  matter  that  it  affects  ownership  in  orcish society. As a\ncommon  saying goes "An orc owns only what he can fight for" and it is not uncommon for\norcs to challenge each other for holdings, luxury goods or even partners.\n\nOrcish  clans  survived  on  a  subsistence living and were not very capable of creating their\nowns  works,  such  as  settlements  or  weapons. Most orcish goods were taken from other\ncivilizations  or reforged from ruins and scraps. Overall, orcs did not care for luxury goods\nbut instead preferred practical and battle-ready items.\n\nThe right to loot enemies is dictated by whomever killed them, with the one dealing killing\nblow  getting  the first pick. Overall, looting of the equipment and belongings of those who\nfall in battle is encouraged, as leaving them there is considered a waste."

 page_events.2521.d: "\n\nHistorically  orcs  kept  bone  trophies  of  their  defeated foes on them, and for their early\nhistory even used bones as currency (before adopting dwarven coinage).\n\n===Views on Magic===\nOrcs  view  most  types  of  magic  as  a  form  of  trickery,  as  it was magic that helped to\nimprison  their  god.  Shamanistic  spirit  magic is accepted as it is seen as divine gift from\nDookan, though rightly feared.\n\n===Warfare and Death===\nWar  is  a  natural  way  of life for orcs, with some shamans even saying they have an innate\ndesire  for  it  derived  from  their  creator, the Great Dookan, who wishes for the death or\nenslavement of all other gods for the wrongs inflicted upon him.\n\nIn  war,  orcs  will fight to the very last and rarely ever flee (which they often view as being\ndishonorable).  The  bodies  of  orcs  are  often  left  to  rot  where  they  fell  in  battle, as\nbattlegrounds   are  considered  somewhat  sacred.  Those  who  die  outside  of  battle  are\nconsidered  cowards,  and as such their bodies are desecrated in a variety of ways, including\nbeing fed to pigs.\n\nDue  to  their  conflict-driven  nature, scars are seen as a badge of honor for an orc and are\noften expanded upon to create ritualistic scars across an orc's skin.\n\n===Notable Members===\nKorgus Dookanson\n\n\n\n\n"

These people made up\nthe  majority of artisans, merchants, tradespeople, farmers, and functionaries for the orcish\nkingdom, and often served as the economic foundation of these kingdoms.\n\nThe  Ozdan  (‘’''freefolk’’'')  refers to orcs who remained within their tribal and clan social\nstructure,  generally  on  the periphery of the Orcish Kingdoms geographically but still very\nimportant  both  culturally and militarily. While nominally under the rule of a given orcish\nkingdom, the Ozdan maintained significant independent rights in return for military service\nunder the settled state.\n\n== Legitimacy and Structure ==\n\nLegitimacy   in   the  orcish  kingdoms  was  derived  from  the  perceived  strength  of  the\nmonarch.  A  monarch  who  was  seen  as  weak  could  be challenged under a traditional,\npre-settlement  rite  known  as  Ozarm’Chadash (‘duel for honor’). While most challengers\nwere of the freefolk ruling class, theoretically any orc could issue such a challenge.\n\nRegardless  of  individual strength, most orcish monarchs still had to deal with the realities\nof  governing  a  kingdom  made  up  of  recently  settled  peoples  who  were adapting to a\nsedentary  lifestyle  in  and around urban centers, and the complex world of tribal loyalties,\nbloodlines,  and  feuds. The pivotal role the Ozdan played in the orcish kingdom's military\nstructure  meant  they  held  an  outsized  amount  of  power  in  politics compared to their\noverall population."
 page_events.2522.t: "Orcish Kingdom 2 / 5"
 page_events.2522.d: "\n\n== Economy ==\n\nLike  most  monarchies  located  in  Escann  the early orcish kingdom model was based on\nlarge  scale  agrarian  production.  Cities,  acting  as  regional centers, and towns, acting as\nsatellites  to  the  cities,  would take these raw resources and in turn produce manufactured\ngoods which would be sold by merchants, often between cities within the kingdom, but also\nto external political entities that were on trading terms with the kingdom.\n\nWhat  was  harvested and what was manufactured was largely based on the local conditions\nof  a  given  kingdom.  Since most of the major Orcish Kingdoms were located in what had\nbeen  Escann,  the  fallen  kingdom's  economy  was  in many ways reforged by the new orc\nmajority  and  that  culture's  sensibilities.  One  major  difference  involved was the orcish\npropensity  to welcome in outside settlers, especially skilled ones. While the semi-nomadic\norcs  made  up a majority of the population, it was by learning from these migrants that the\norcish  kingdom  truly began to transition from the semi-nomadic wanderers they had been\nto a fully settled society.\n\nOne  unique  aspect  of  the  orcish economy was the tension held with the freefolk and the\ncities  of  the  kingdom.  While  nominally  part  of  the  same  state,  the Ozdan both held\nthemselves and were held apart from the settled peoples, and while less common then some\nwould  suggest,  it  was  known  for  Ozdan  tribes  to  attempt  to  loot what they saw as an\nundefended city. The economic effect of one of these raids could be felt for decades, and in\nseveral  cases  have  been  suggested  to  be  a  major  cause  for the failures of some orcish\nkingdoms to persist through the\n\n\n\n''Ed.

If the king is seen\nas  weak,  they  were  subject to the orcish rite of Ozarm'Chadash, the challengers of which\nwere  usual  the  tribal  chiefs of the Ozdan.

So this means Military = here's how military in\norcish  kingdom  worked.  Ozdan  was  majority  of  army  with tribal levies. Dargom held\nstanding army and elites\n\n\n==Society==\nSociety in an Orcish Kingdom is divided into two, strongly distinctive groups:"
 page_events.2524.t: "Orcish Kingdom 4 / 5"
 page_events.2524.d: "\n\n*The  'Dargom'  (meaning  ''settled  people'') are orcs who abandoned their tribal heritage\nand   settled   in   conquered   human   cities   and   towns.   They  adopted  roles  thought\nuncharacteristic  in  a  stereotypical orcish tribe, like farmers, craftsmen, bureaucrats, even\ntraders  and artists - often being thought of as a 'civilized orc'. They formed the foundation\nof  the  orcish  kingdom's  economy and government, as well as legitimized the kingdom to\noutsiders in diplomacy.\n*The  'Ozdan' (meaning ''freefolk'') are orcs who retained their tribal identity and lived in\nthe  rural  countryside of orcish kingdoms. As they are an continuation of traditional orcish\nclans,  they  were  heavily  militarized  societies  and lived mostly through hunt and animal\nhusbandry,   though   they   also   performed  subsistence  agriculture  to  make  themselves\nself-sufficient  from  the  state.  In  general  the  Ozdan contributed very little to the state's\neconomy and development, however in return they formed the core of the orcish armies, as\nits  chieftains  are bound by their honour to provide their clansmen to the king during war.\nWhile  the Ozdan are often described as a group, they are in fact divided along ancient clan\naffiliations  and  lineages, and conflict among the Ozdan is not uncommon to the point that\na large role of the Dargom and central state is to be a mediator between these clans.\n\n\n==Dargom==\nThe  basis  of  Orcish  Kingdom's  economy  is  based  around  cities, where Dargom live.\nOrcish  towns,  in most cases, are rebuilt Escanni cities, which suffered after the Greentide\nand  warfare  between orcs and adventurers. The first orcs that lived in these cities squatted\nin  them  as their counterparts did to the dwarven holds of the Serpentspine Mountains, but\neventually  the  consolidation of the orcish clans under one larger clan led to the formation\nof  a  unified state (an orcish kingdom), which led to the repair and rebuilding of the cities\nas centres of power for the most powerful of clans.\n\nAs  the  orcish  kingdoms gained tentative peace with their adventurer counterparts (who in\nturn  made  their  own kingdoms and nations) trade opened up again and humans and other\nraces  came  to  live  in these rebuilt cities, filling in the initial void of craftsmen and other\nskilled  workers.  Eventually  the  orcs  would  learn from these migrants and form the first\nDargom, creating their own guilds and manufactories."

 page_events.2525.d: "\n\nHowever,  unlike  rest  of  Cannor,  the  prosperity  of the city strongly relied on the king's\nauthority  and  sensibility.  Many  cities,  if  left  without  king's protection, were raided by\nneighboring  Ozdan  tribes  despite their pledge of loyalty to the king. Despite the Dargom\ngoing  into  other  professions, these cities came to have a strong martial tradition like their\nancestors,  forming citizen militias if the Ozdan tribesmen came for war. The Dargom also\nserved  in  the army proper, forming the bulk of the standing army of the country, while the\nOzdan  provided  large  amounts  of  tribal  levies  that would consist of the majority of the\narmy during wartime.\n\n==Ozdan==\nOzdan orcs chose to keep their tribal ways in this changing world. Whether it was conquest\nby  stronger  orcish  nations,  threat  of  adventurers  or  enslavement, the Ozdan eventually\nchose to submit to the settled orcs and their kings in return for protection against the rising\nadventurer kingdoms of the time.\n\nIn  return  the  Ozdan  were  granted  privileges  to  maintain their traditional way of life in\nexchange for serving as levies in the orcish army when the time came. While their weapons\nwere often outdated, the Ozdan retained the rough martial upbringing of orc life, especially\nwhen  the  Dargom  were  at  their  height at the later stages of the orcish kingdoms, and as\nsuch were skilled warriors.\n\nHowever, that came with its downsides. Having such militant societies often posed a threat\nto  the  government  who  had  to juggle between demands of being a diplomatic nation and\nthe  demands  of  orcish  tribal law. If they prove themselves as too weak, Ozdan chieftains\ncould  challenge  the  orcish king to Ozarm'Chadash for the leadership over the country. In\ncase  they  refuse  to  accept  this duel, a large army of Ozdan started a civil war against the\n'weak ruler', aiming to bring rule into the chieftain's hands.\n\nKnowing  this,  orcish  kings  tried  usually to be respectful with the Ozdan, and keep them\nsatisfied,  to  avoid civil war. Ozdan were usually favored in disputes with the Dargom, and\ngiven freedom in their internal affairs. All these facts did not contribute well to the stability\nof the kingdom."

They gain their namesake from Aldresia, the heroine who saved Cannor in the\neponymous  Aldresian  Crusade  against  the  undead.  The  order  is most famous for their\narcane  knights,  who wield magic using their swords as a spellcasting focus using the art of\nDiranbe.\n\nThe   Orda  Aldresia  forms  the  second  magical  body  within  the  Empire  of  Anbennar\nalongside the Magisterium, which they have a deep rivalry with.\n\n==History==\n===Aldresian Crusade and Founding===\n\n===Bodyguards of the Emperor===\n\n===Greentide Schism===\nWhen  the  Greentide  struck  in  1424 the order was embroiled in the Lilac Wars, serving\nofficially  in  the  defense  of  the Emperor despite the holder of the Dove Throne changing\nfrequently. Due to the order's original goals to defend Cannor from evil, many in the order\nsaw  the Greentide as a calling to their old ideals, petitioning the leadership of the order to\nabstain  from the war and send their forces to Escann to help defend against the Greentide.\nHowever  the  order,  like  their  rivals in the Magisterium, forbade any intervention in the\nGreentide, and focused their efforts on fighting in the Lilac Wars.\n\nIn  response  to  this,  many in the order disobeyed their superiors and left anyways forming\nadventuring  bands  such  as the Sword Covenant. This schism nearly broke the order, with\nthe majority of its younger members leaving the Orda Aldresia for Escann.\n\nDespite  this  many returned after the Greentide, and just like their Magisterium rivals, the\nnext  generation of the Orda Aldresia were inundated with idealistic zeal gained from Corin\nand  her efforts. This was much more apparent in the order than their magister equivalents,\nwith many in the order becoming devout adherents of the Corinite faith that rose later."

During this time\ntheir  loyalty  was tested both within and without. Some believed that regardless of religion\nthat  they  were  to  serve the emperor, whilst others believed Corin's calling to be a higher\npurpose.  It  was  during this time that they were officially stripped of any martial duties to\nthe emperor.\n\nBy  the  end  of  the  Corinite  Wars  the  order's  role was partly restored and they became\nbodyguards  in ceremony only. The order went into general decline during this time, losing\nall their holdings except for their fortress of Arca Aldresia.\n\n===Defenders of the Ravelian Church===\nBy  the  rise of the Ravelian Church in the 18th century the Orda Aldresia was a dwindling\norder that had long abandoned its original purpose to defend against evil and the undead as\ntheir  founder  Aldresia  did.  By  this  time  their  role  as  bodyguards  of  the Emperor of\nAnbennar  had  waned  and  only  a  token  force  stayed  in  the  Dove  Palace  in a largely\nceremonial role.\n\nDuring  this  time  the early Ravelian Church, in their bid to gain legitimacy and followers,\nquickly  began to declare many gods of the Regent Court as saints within their religion, but\nin  this  they  also  declared  many  non-deities as saints, and first among them as Aldresia.\nThis  renewed  the fervour within the order, and the order itself declared a new purpose: as\nthe martial arm of the Ravelian Church, and renamed itself as the Order of St. Aldresia."

Originally  they  were  the\nVacyntassi  Temple  Guard,  but  they  pledged  loyalty  to Jaher after he was recognized as\nSurael Reborn by the Kašra. The Surnabari quickly became an elite group of Sun Elves and\nBulwari who acted as guardians and agents of both Jaher and Jaerel.\n\nDuring  the  rule  of  Jexis, the Exemplars mostly accompanied Jexis to Cannor, where they\nbecame   an   exclusively  elven,  zealot,  and  supremacist  group.  After  Jexis’  death,  the\nExemplars  settled  in the lands that became the kingdom of Elizna where Vulzin welcomed\nthem  and  built  them  a  headquarters.  Following  the  death  of  Vulzin,  the  Exemplars\nreformed  themselves,  rejecting  elven  supremacism  and  opening  their ranks to Humans\nagain.  Outside  of Elizna, they use the local temples as headquarters. They were supported\nfinancially  by the clergy and by donations made by the Sun Elf kings, the Bulwari Akals or\nother wealthy individuals.\n\nAll  Exemplars  followed  the tenets of the New Sun Cult, mostly fulfilling a role similar to\nthe  Cannorian  adventurers by protecting the populace from monsters, keeping an eye over\nthe   Elven  Magi  and  hunting  the  rogue  Bulwari  Magi.  However,  they  also  acted  as\ninquisitors  and  actively searched and fought heretic groups they deemed dangerous, except\nin Irrliam where Taelarios dedicated the Order of Zenith to this task.\n\nAfter  the  discovery  of  the Elven homeland, many Exemplars followed Ecaris to Aelantir,\nwhere  they founded the Empire of Rezankand.

''On Time Travel''\n\n==Early Life ==\n===Birth and Pact===\nMuch  of  Oubblig's  early  life  has  been lost to time. He was born sometime in the early\n1400s  AA  into  Clan  Brambleskinner.  Sometime in 1430 AA he managed to negotiate a\npact              with             a             powerful             Archfey             known             as\n[https://anbennar.fandom.com/wiki/Archfey#The_Prince_of_Fools  the  Prince  of Fools],\nsecretly  breaking  the  customs  of  his  clan.

These quick and\nsudden  victories  earned  him  fame  and  he started to gain followers. By 1433 AA he had\nmanaged  to  seize  a  part  of  the  Verdant  Link from Salla Cenág, almost the entire Bone\nGrove  as well as subjugating his former clanboss of Clan Brambleskinner. That same year\nOubblig  consolidated his newly conquered territory and declared himself clanboss of Clan\nOubbligsband,  initiating  raids  against  the  nearby  wood  elves  of  Salla Cenág and Salla\nDrennen shortly afterwards in 1434 AA.\n\n==Fall of the Verdant Veil ==\n===Defeat and Capture===\nLeading  his  army  through  the  Gladeway,  his  patron  used the magical properties of the\nGladeways  to  transport  Oubblig  and his army forwards in time by six years, to 1440 AA.\nThe  exact reason for this remains unknown, but the most accepted theory states that it was\nOubblig's  arrogance  and  over-reliance  on  use  of force and violence instead of guile and\ncleverness, that offended the Prince of Fools. They quickly came across the army of the orc\nclan  Cursed  Howl. With both sides looking for a fight, the two armies immediately began\nhostilities.  However,  before the two armies could clash, the Oubbligsband army suddenly\nvanished from thin air leaving only Oubblig behind.

 page_events.2535.d: "\n\n===Freedom===\nHis constant escape attempts and theatrics started to amuse the Cursed Howl chief Gordak\nand  the  two  struck  up  a  friendship.  This  mutual respect soon led to Gordak releasing\nOubblig  from  his  captivity  in  late  1440  AA.  Oubblig, without the support of his clan,\nopted  to  stay with his new friend for the time being. During the orcish wars and conquests\nagainst  both goblin and elves, Oubblig discovers that the orcs are being manipulated by an\narchfey  patron  of their own, The Prince of the Blackened Branch as well as the Ashentree\nFey,  and  would  be  a considerable future threat to both his people and his clan. In 1443,\nOubblig  left  Cursed  Howl  in search of his own clan, to find a way to defeat the orcs. He\ndiscovered  that  his  entire  clan had been destroyed and scattered during the six years he's\nbeen  absent,  that his name was being used as a curse and finally that he had been dead for\nseveral  years. Desperate for any way of defeating the orcs, he turned to his former enemies\nof the wood elves.\n\n===Meeting Corin===\nOubblig  suspected  that  he wouldn't be trusted due to his race, and used magic to disguise\nhimself  as  a  wood  elf.  Just  before  Oubblig  arrived at Salla Drennen, Queen Narawen\nDrennen  had  called  the Conclave of Elynáile to discuss the recent orc and goblin attacks.\nMany  elves  were  arriving  and  leaving  allowing  Oubblig  to  sneak  in  undetected. The\nConclave was interrupted by the arrival of Corin and her party asking for assistance against\nthe  Greentide  in  Escann,  and  Oubblig  decided  to  join  forces with them as their goals\naligned.  He  revealed his true form once they had left Salla Drennen. As he had suspected\nearlier,  his  new  companions  didn't  trust  him  until Corin convinced them he was to be\ntrusted.\n\n===Facing the Eldest and Returning to the Past===\nThe  party  planned  on lifting the Verdant Veil so Corin could get wood elf reinforcements\nfor  Escann,  while  Oubblig  wanted  a  way  to  defeat  the  orcs.  The  Verdant  Veil  was\nmaintained  by a powerful Archfey called The Eldest, and the only way to break it would be\nto  kill  him.  Oubblig  led  the  party  through the Feyrealm, until they faced the Eldest in\nbattle.  There  Oubblig  saw  his  own  decaying corpse, and the wounds he had managed to\ndeal  the  Eldest  before  presumably  succumbing.  The  group  defeated the Eldest, in part\nthanks  to  to  wound  Oubblig  dealt  they  arrived.  As the Eldest was killed, he released a\npowerful  magical  surge,  which  Oubblig  used to transport himself and his previous army\nback  to  the  past,  in  1434 AA. In doing so, he revealed his pact with an archfey and was\nquickly  shunned  by  his  clan.  Before  he  could start his plans for saving his clan, he was\nalmost killed in an assassination attempt."

Those  wounds weakened the Verdant Veil for a short period, allowing his clan to\nescape  the Deepwoods. As Oubbligs sacrifice became apparent to his former clan and they\nunderstood  what  had  transpired,  they named themselves to Clan Oubbligschild to honor\nhim.  Oubblig's  sacrifice  also  allowed  Corin and her party to leave the Deepwoods with\nWood  Elf  reinforcements,  which  were  crucial  for  Corins  final  victory against Korgus\nDookanson.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

They  were prolific raiders and considered a\nmajor  threat  during  their time. Oubbligsband fell apart once it was revealed that Oubblig\nwas  using fey magic, something that was considered taboo according to their beliefs. It was\nlater  reformed  into  Oubbligschild Clan after Oubblig sacrificed himself to allow the clan\nto escape the Deepwoods by temporarily weakening the Verdant Veil in 1335 AA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

 page_events.1109.d: "\nOwen  Kayman  was a high ranking human mechanist prominent in the Gommo, most well\nknown for his contributions to the Korashi Drills.\n\nBorn  in  the  city of Portnamm, Owen demonstrated an affinity for artificery from a young\nage.  As  he  progressed  through  his  education,  going  to  high  ranking  Gommo-funded\nschools,  he  was  often  taunted  for being a human in advanced artificery classes that were\nmajority  gnomish.  Even  then, he found himself a teacher to his peers and would often be\nasked  to  check  and  fix errors in their works. Graduating as a mechanist, Owen would go\non  to  become  a professor at a college for artificery before being recruited by the Gommo\nas  a  researcher.  Here Owen truly found his passion, errors. He was known to obsess and\nscrutinize  every  detail and error in others' works, being assigned project to project simply\nto  fix  the  works of others. Writings say once a malfunction was reported to him he would\nwork  for  days  on  end,  rarely  taking breaks if at all, to fix it. After the testing of the first\nKorashi Drill MK1 Owen was called in to fix the problems preventing the drill from being\nable  to  be shrunken. Many reports say it was thanks to his efforts that the drill was able to\nachieve the MK5 in the time that it did.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

 page_events.1110.d: "\nOzarm'chadash   (from  Orcish  -  duel  for  honor)  is  an  ancient  and  respected  Orcish\ntradition.  It  is  the  duel  between  a  clan  chief  and a member of his clan who considers\nhimself more fit to rule the clan.\n\n==Role in society==\nIn  orcish  society,  where  strength is the key to your social status, duels are not rare. Orcs\nfought  over  food,  water,  property  and even partners. And of course, the right to rule the\nclan can also be contested in such tradition. That is why the stability of each orc clan relies\non  the  martial  abilities  of their leader. If he proves himself as one of the best warriors in\nclan,  his rule is relatively peaceful, the tribe may even accept their child as a successor, but\nonly until the moment they consider them worthy of their parent's name.\n\nHowever, when a chief shows signs of weakness, mighty and ambitious orcs of the clan will\nimmediately  begin  to estimate their chances against the current ruler. If they believe their\nchances  are  high  enough,  they  will  gather  the  whole tribe and challenge the chief for a\nduel.  When  that  happens,  the  chief  can  either  give  up  the throne, be humiliated and\nbanished  from  the  tribe, or they can accept the fight and try to protect their right to rule.\nAs  orcs  see it, both outcomes are good for the tribe - if the chief loses, that means that he\nwas  a  weakling,  unfit  to  rule  their  clan.  And  if  the  chief wins, he proves that he was\nunderestimated and earns the respect and the trust of his tribe.\n\n==Development==\nAs  orcs  changed,  so  did  their  traditions.  After the appearance of the first organized orc\nstate  in Escann, the new government began to limit this tradition. It was consider barbaric,\nand  was  prohibited in Grombar, as theses duels were threatening the stability of the state.\nOther  orcish  states  tried to put it under strict control, to prevent the ozarm'chadash from\nhappening too often.\n\n\n"

This page lists all the Pantheonic Councils of the Regent Court and\ntheir known dates.\n\n== The First Pantheonic Council - Who We Are ==\nIn  600  BA,  the  First  Pantheonic  Council  gathers the Castanite and Dostanite tribes of\nCannor  to  collect their knowledge of the divine. They canonize the gods Castellos, Nerat,\nFalah,  Yshtralania,  Halanna and the other Primordials, as well as establishing the concept\nof  the  ‘Spawn’,  which  are  evil  creatures. The ‘Before Times’ and Primordial War of the\nCreation Myth are canonized and recorded.\n\nThe  council  agreed  that  gnolls  and  other bestial races were included among the Spawn.\nThis  is  widely  attested  to  be  a  political  move  by  then-Emperor  Castan II, known as\nBeastbane,  who  later  launched  the  Second Great Cleansing. During this time, Castanor\nstruck against its bestial neighbors and invaded the gnoll-controlled lands of the south. It is\nlikely  that  one  of  the  major  factors of the Cleansing's success in wiping bestial races to\nnear-extinction within Cannor proper was the religious fervor and backing gained from this\nCouncil.\n\n== The Second Council - Gods of the Alen ==\nFollowing  the  expansion of Castanor to include new tribes, the Pantheon was expanded to\naccommodate their gods.\n\nAdean was decreed to be the son of Castellos and Halanna. Agrados was named the brother\nof  Castellos,  establishing  him  as present for the Primordial War. Following the war, the\ntwo  brothers  come  into  conflict,  with Castellos being victorious. He forgave his brother\nand offered him a place at his side as he ruled Halann.\n\nThe  Milcori  death god was determined to be the same as Nerat, and so was not canonized\nas a new god."

His  portfolio encompasses crafts, construction, and\ninventions.\n\n== The Fourth Council - A Court of Regents ==\nThis  Council established that kings and rulers acted as the will of the divine, thus defining\nthe  Pantheon  as  the  Regent Court. The nature of its counterpart, the Infernal Court, was\nalso defined, and aspects of the Creation Myth were further clarified.\n\n== The Fifth Council - The Court Realigned ==\nEstablishing  a formal recognition of Castellos’ Godly Decrees and the Godswar that led to\nthem,  the  Fifth  Pantheonic Council also provided rationale for the prior council's claims\nof  regency  via the Inheritance War, which barred the gods from future action. Esmaryal is\nrecognized as divine and further identified as the spouse of Castellos, with Adean and Ryala\ntheir children. The bestial creatures of the Spawn are declared the offspring of Agrados.\n\n== The Sixth Council - Minara Deified ==\nThe  Pantheonic  Council  recognizes Minara as an avatar of Ryala, deifying her as goddess\nof lesser love, joy, and celebrations.\n\n== The Seventh Council - Munas Deified ==\nIn  1015  AA,  the  Seventh  Pantheonic  Council  established that Munas Moonsinger had\nascended  as  the  first  Elven  member  of the Regent Court and was now the patron god of\nmusic  and navigation.

Known as the Lotus Sisters, these three women transformed\ntheir  private  fief,  originally  a small country villa, into a place of luxury and high society.\nThe  remote  palace would become known for its tranquil halls and well-kept grounds, and\nits  first  masters  would  lay  the foundations for the grandeur that would become the Ruby\nGarden, a wonder that would not be considered complete until over a thousand years later,\nin 1229.\n\n===The Eleven Kingdoms Period===\nWith  the death of Jarael in 1136 the Phoenix Empire collapsed and Rahen descended into\na  warlord  period. During the Eleven Kingdoms Period, Parusad Bhola would enter into a\nstruggle  with  Endhuvi  over  the  Maharaaja  plains.  After  30  years  of slowly escalating\nskirmishes,  the  conflict would finally come to a head in 1169 when Endhuvi would gather\na  large  army  and  march  to  Parusad Bhola itself. The attack would be halted by Anipari\n“the  Roaring  Tiger''.  She  would lead a valiant cavalry charge into the front of the enemy\narmy,  shattering  it  in  the  process.  When  Anipari  tried  to initiate a counter attack the\ncampaign  would  end  in  failure  after  she was crushed by a rampaging elephant in 1173,\nduring  the  siege  of  Endhuvi.  Following  that,  the  conflict would become a stalemate of\nskirmishes,  though  the  conflict  would  weaken  both  sides  and  enable  the Kingdom of\nDurasidehni  to  capture  the  region  and later establish the second Raj.

Parusad  Bhola  would  also  be  granted a boon by the second Raj\nwhen  it  was  elevated to a Senapti in 1304, mostly due to their family ties to Harimar and\nthe prestige of the Ruby Garden itself.\n\nDuring  the Brothers war of 1399 Parusad Bhola would side with Amanapurna the Bloody,\nbecause  of  the friendship between Atikayar of the Ruby Garden and Amanapurna. Parusad\nBhola  was located near the heaviest fighting of the war and was heavily devastated by rebel\narmies ranging out from their stronghold in nearby Dhujat.\n\nThe  Smothering  Sickness  of  1414  would also reach Parusad Bhola, but due to the Ruby\nGarden and the large amount of botanical knowledge that came with the gigantic collection\nof  different  plants,  the  Senapti  was able to organize a more effective response than many\nother  realms.  Only  an  estimated  13%  of its population would succumb to the sickness,\ncompared to the average of 20% across Rahen.\n\nThe  peace  between  Endhuvi and Parusad Bhola established by the Rajas would be broken\nin  1432  when Miyana of the Ruby Garden ascended to the throne of Parusad Bhola, after\nRamnath, her regent and later husband, abdicated in her favour. The first woman to rule in\nover  a  century, the neighbouring Senapti of Endhuvi declared the ascension of a woman to\nthe  title  of  Senapti  illegitimate  and  pressed  their  claim to the Maharaaja plains. After\nmultiple  small  skirmishes,  Raja  Indranayar  I  interfered  and  sided with Parusad Bhola,\nallowing  the  Senapti  to  continue  being ruled by a direct descendant of the Lotus Sisters.\nThis  decision  brought peace but was highly controversial, further undermining the already\ndeclining  central  authority  of  the  Lotus  Throne, as many disagreed with the decision to\nallow a woman to rule a Senapti."

The  league  would be formed with multiple neighbours with the\naim  of  halting  the rising influence of Bhuvauri’s trade empire. The league would hold out\nduring  the fall of the second Harimraj, continuing their activities under the auspices of the\nJadd Empire until the advent of the Great Dhujat War.\n\nThe  Great  Dhujat  War,  also  known  as  the  War of the Triple Alliance, began with the\nCommand’s  invasion  of  Dhugajir  in  1572.  In  1580,  Bhuvauri, Vanrahar and the Jadd\nEmpire   gathered  in  Parusad  Bhola  to  plan  a  counter  attack  and  rescue  the  city  of\nKhisrapid,  which was then under siege. In the end the triple alliance succeeded and halted\nthe advance of the Command. Despite guaranteeing their freedom from Hobgoblin rule the\nwar  would  end  the  independence  of  Parusad  Bhola,  as Bhuvauri managed to establish\ncontrol over the Senapti at the end of the war. This control would weaken in the late 1600s\nwhen  the  Jadd  Empire  took ownership of the lands of the former Senapti. Parusad Bhola\nwould  remain  under  the  control  of  the  Jadd Empire throughout the Deioderan and the\nRending  of  the  Realms, although the long-coveted Maharaaja plains were once again split\nbetween Hobgoblin ownership and the Nahana Jadd by the late 1700s.\n==The Ruby Garden==\nThe  Ruby  Garden  is  one  of  the  most  elaborate  and beautiful gardens in Haless. First\nplanted  by  Harimar,  the gardens would be officially established by the Lotus Sisters in 74\nin  the  memory  of  having  gardened  there  with  their  father.  The gardens went through\ncountless iterations, expansions, disasters and reconstructions over its millenia of existence.\nAn  ambitious  project  that  would  be  the pride of the Senapti, the gardens were declared\nfinished  in 1229, although minor alterations continued to be made whenever possible over\nthe coming years.

The gardens even had a grotto,\nwhich  contained  multiple  types  of  serpentsbloom.  Most  of  the exotic plants would be\ngathered  by  expeditions  sent  all  over Haless, with the most notable expedition being the\n525  Azka-Sur  Grand  Circuit. This expedition, written about in many Bulwari sources for\nits  extravagance  and  generosity, brought back many treasures of the west, including major\narchitectural inspirations from the hanging gardens found by merchants sent out in advance\nby  the  caravan  in  Gelkar.  The  expedition  to Bulwar certainly wasn’t the only one of its\nkind,  expeditions  would  also be sent towards Sarhal via the Rahenic colonies and towards\nthe   deepest  parts  of  the  Lupulan  jungle.  The  most  notable  acquisitions  from  these\nexpeditions  were  flesh-eating  plants  from  Lupulan and bell stapelias from Sarhal. These\nexpeditions  were  large  and  organized,  but  they  weren’t  the  only  way  plants  would be\ngathered.  Plant-hunters  would  be  paid  well for any exotic plants, along with their seeds,\nthat were brought to the Ruby Garden.\n\nThe gardens would be used by the upper castes of Parusad Bhola for recreation and debates\non  a wide range of topics. The Ruby Garden dynasty would also use the garden to impress\nand  soothe  foreign  diplomats  and  emissaries,  which  allowed  them to make favourable\ndeals.\n\nThe  Ruby  Garden  would  be  partially  lost  during  the Rending, when parts of it burned\ndown.

True to its name, the path\nconstituted the Ynn's primary source of gold for most of its history.\n\nIts  Epednar  name,  Path  of  the  Peoples, likely refers to the Harafic Ruinborn and Ynnic\nRuinborn  peoples  found  at  the  ends  of  the  path,  as  well as the Epednar people living\nthroughout its length.\n\nThe   Haraf'ne   were   also   aware   of   the  path,  which  they  considered  the  'Epednar\nConnection',  welcoming  the  Epednar  as eastern cousins whenever they braved the desert\nand mountain passes to come trade in Haraf.\n\n==History==\n===Origins (350s AA - 625 AA)===\nThe  Epednar  migrated  to the Ynn River Valley over the course of the fourth century after\nAsh,  claiming  the  western  region  that became known as the Epednan Expanse, including\nthe  territory  between  the Ynn proper and Haraf. It is hard to say when exactly the Path of\nGold  came  into  being,  however  a trade route existed by the time of the formation of the\nYnnic Empire in 625 AA.\n\nThe  settlement  of  Selocshana,  meaning 'Wayside', is said to have received its name from\nthe  Path  of  Gold  and  to  have  served as the last civilian settlement before entry into the\nEpednan Expanse."

While on campaign, any Epednar tribe who did not cooperate with the\nhunt would be captured or evicted from their territory, and the Ynnic Empire built fortified\noutposts  called  ''prealtac''  to  keep  surveillance  over  said territories. The Path of Gold\nespecially was lined up with several ''prealtac'' which doubled as waystations, and the trade\nroute was re-inaugurated for public use.\n\nMost  ''prealtac''  would  be  destroyed  during  Hubinach's  Invasion  in  1076,  when the\nEpednar  united  in  defiance  of  the Ynnic Empire. Hubinach was defeated at the Battle of\nKonyrhrada  in  1078, and while Emperor Carodin I agreed to abandon the ''prealtac'', the\nEpednar  tribes  living  in  Selocshana's surroundings became Ynnic vassals and agreements\nwere  struck  so  that Ynnics and Epednar would join forces to repair and maintain the Path\nof Gold.\n\nA  century  later,  the  Third  Ynnic  Civil  War  broke  out.  In  1152  the region of Sarda\ndescended  into  anarchy  after  the death of Emperor Varamel at the Battle of Arganjuzorn,\nand  the  Epednar  nomads,  including  some  previously  subjugated  tribes, launched raids\nagainst  many  of  the  Ynnics' western territories, including Selocshana, which was relieved\nby the arrival of Adrjon Orderbringer."

Nonetheless  some  limited land trade continued to be performed by the\nEpednar living along the route.\n\nWith  the  Rediscovery of Aelantir, numerous Cannorian adventurers made their way to the\nYnn.  Of these, the Shining Circle, Plumwall Expedition and Menibór Free Company took\nto  living  in  the  territory the Path of Gold coursed through. The Menibór Free Company\nsettled  closest  to the Ekyunimoy Mountains and struck many gold veins, founding the city\nof  Tiru  Móine which became a regional center for mining and gambling. Long convoys of\ncaravans  would  travel the Epednan Expanse, connecting people and settlements on the old\nPath of Gold, while many Epednar were integrated as riders, scouts and couriers, patrolling\nthose routes and helping Cannorians get acquainted with the local geography.\n\nAs  to  Selocshana,  its  rulers  of  House yen Nizel were able to regain some of the ancient\nluster   by   proposing   themselves   as   one  of  the  main  intermediaries  for  Cannorian\nhomesteaders  looking  to trade with the Ynn. Cannorian influence was felt in 1568 already\nwhen  Lord  Talvynn  of  Selocshana converted to the worship of Begga. While this act sent\nshockwaves  through  Ynnic  Ruinborn  society,  with  most neighbouring lords denouncing\nTalvynn's  conversion,  Selocshana's  inhabitants  thought  little  of  it,  placing  trust in the\nCannorians for the following centuries.\n\nThis  trust  would  be  challenged  by  the  events  of  the  Red Year in 1787, which gave an\nopening  for  Plumstead to invade Selocshana. Besieged by a modernized army and with no\nreinforcements  in  sight,  the  ancient  lordship  quickly  surrendered,  being  annexed by a\nCannorian  power  and  losing  the  local sovereignty House yen Nizel had long enjoyed.

In a Phoenix Estate the monarch, who\nowns a large amount of farmland, lends these lands to other Sun Elves, who become part of\na landowner nobility dependent on the king in order to maintain their wealth.\n\n== Origin ==\nThe  Phoenix  Estates  have  their  origin  in  the  governorates  of the Phoenix Empire that\nbecame independent after the death of Jexis. The dissolution of the Empire put the Bulwari\nakalates  and  republics  in a dilemma. Most of them joined Jaher voluntarily, and with the\ndeath   of   Jexis,   according  to  the  Bulwari  traditions,  they  had  the  right  to  become\nindependent.  To  avoid  this,  both  the  Sun Elven kings and those Bulwari who desired to\nkeep  the status quo started to work on keeping the old governorates intact. In exchange for\nloyalty  and  taxes,  the  Sun  Elves  negotiated  and  granted special rights and autonomy to\nsome  city-states, while absorbing those who had less political power into their estates. And\neven  in  those  cases,  the  city-states  kept  a degree of autonomy, compared with the areas\npopulated by Sun Elves, the core of the Successor Kings’ domains.\n\nIn  some cases, the transition was smooth. For example cities in Sareyand, Birzartanšes and\nRe’uyel,  didn’t have such a strong tradition of autonomy, as they were used to being part of\nlarger  political  units,  such  as  the  kingdoms of Yametšes and Akalšes. Added to this, the\ngovernors who ruled these regions had been increasing their influence for a century through\nalliances with the Bulwari nobility.\n\nThe  disintegration  of  the  Phoenix  Empire and subsequent wars saw the concentration of\nland  in  the  hands  of  the Phoenix Successors kings, and to capitalize this great amount of\nland  that  was  difficult  for  the  royal  family  to directly exploit, they lent it to other Sun\nElves,  who  became  a  new type of nobility that depended directly of the monarch to keep\ntheir wealth.\n\nThe  system  was  not a completely new institution in Bulwar, but a variant of how the land\nowned  by  the  temple  was administered, with the clergy lending land bought or gained by\ndonation,  either  by  particulars  or  by  the  state,  to  landless  people,  in many cases the\norphans raised by the temple."

Contrary to Cannorian and Moon Elven\nnobility,  the  Ralkadezim’s  land was worked by paid farmers, both Bulwari and Sun Elven;\nand  their  power was purely based on their riches and their relation with the king, contrary\nto  Cannorian nobility that had the capacity of mobilizing armies, as that was a power given\nby the king to the governor of the province.\n\nThe power of this new nobility varied from kingdom to kingdom. Those in the lower Suran\nplain  were  generally  poorer and were forced by law to pay their employees a decent wage,\nbut  in  Sareyand, were the Ralkadezim owned large amounts of lands and the law generally\nbenefited  Sun  Elves,  they became wealthier than in other regions, and built grand manors\nnear the lake Naza.\n\nDuring  war, the Ralkadezim formed a heavy cavalry unit that acted as elite cavalry and the\nmonarch's guard, similar to the Jaher Kadezim, the Jaherian Companions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

There  used  to be a theory that they were\ncreated  during  the  Day  of  Ashen  Skies,  with  the  Prime  Material  being  the balanced\noutcome  of  the  catastrophic  event.

 page_events.1137.d: "\n''“…no  matter  how  many  prayers  are  made  or  how  many  rituals are cast, a prince or\ngeneral is just as likely to be born a planetouched as a cattle herder or slave.”''\n\n-  Ngolo  Modibo,  "Secrets  of  the Planetouched”, 1895 AA Planetouched are individuals\nwho  possess  ancestry  from  the Elemental Planes via genie heritage. Each planetouched is\nattuned  to a specific element, which can be seen in their physical appearance, such as blue\nskin  for  those attuned to the Plane of Water or flaming hair for those attuned to the Plane\nof  Fire.  The  process  of  becoming a planetouched is not hereditary. It is believed to be a\nrare   occurrence,  triggered  by  prolonged  exposure  to  elemental  energy  in  areas  with\nsignificant  amounts  of  genie  relics.  Although Planetouched appears almost at random in\nvarious places, some places are not even strongly connected to elemental magic.\n\n=== Appearance: ===\nPlanetouched   individuals  often  exhibit  physical  traits  associated  with  their  elemental\nheritage.  For  example,  a planetouched attuned to the Plane of Earth might have skin that\nresembles stone, or a planetouched attuned to the Plane of Air might have hair that billows\nas  if  it  were  wind.  These  features can be subtle and not impede their ability to blend in\nwith  other  races.  However,  in  moments  of strong emotion or the use of their elemental\npowers,  their heritage becomes more apparent. For others, their elemental heritage is very\nclearly visible at all times.\n\nAdditionally,  planetouched  often  exhibit  an otherworldly quality in their eyes, which can\nglow  with  the  colors  of  their  elemental  plane. Some planetouched also have distinctive\nmarkings on their skin, such as tattoos or scars, that reflect their elemental ancestry.\n\nIt  is  important to note that the appearance of a planetouched is unique to each individual,\nand  may  not  always  align with common preconceptions of what a planetouched "should"\nlook  like.  This  variability  further emphasizes the individuality of each planetouched and\ntheir connection to the elemental forces they represent.\n"

 page_events.2549.d: "\n==== Types of Planetouched ====\nPlanetouched  individuals  are  characterized  by  their  connection to the elemental planes,\nresulting  in unique physical attributes and abilities. The following are the most commonly\nrecognized types of planetouched:\n\n===== Fire Planetouched =====\nThese individuals are associated with the Plane of Fire and possess a fiery appearance, with\nflaming  hair,  fiery eyes, and red or orange skin. They can control and manipulate fire and\nare known for their passionate and impulsive personalities.\n\n===== Water Planetouched =====\nThese  individuals  are  connected  to the Plane of Water and have blue or green skin, gills,\nand  webbed  fingers.  Their  hair  can  be flowing as if underwater, or like tendrils of solid\nwater. They can control water and are known for their calm, collected demeanor.\n\n===== Earth Planetouched =====\nThese   individuals   are   linked  to  the  Plane  of  Earth  and  have  a  sturdy  and  rooted\nappearance,  with  features  such as stone-like skin, crystal-like protrusions, rocky features,\nand  an  earthy  aura.  They  can  control and manipulate the earth and are known for their\npracticality and stability.\n\n===== Air Planetouched =====\nThese  individuals  are  linked  to  the  Plane of Air and have a wispy, ethereal appearance,\nwith  features  such  as  misty  or cloud-like hair and skin that shimmers like the sky. They\ncan control and manipulate air and are known for their agility and swiftness.\n\n===== Merged Planetouched (Disputed) =====\nThese  individuals  have  only been encountered in exceedingly rare cases, and exhibit traits\nfrom  two different elements. A combination of water and air might have ice and snow-like\nattributes,  or fire and earth might be more outright metallic. Since these individuals are so\nrare,  there  are  no  sources  apart  from  oral recollections. In truth, it is believed that the\nmerged  do  not  exist  at  all  and  are  pure  myths  since  none  have been encountered in\nrecorded history."

 page_events.2550.d: "\n\n=== History ===\n\n==== Persecution of Planetouched ====\nThe  history of planetouched and their treatment by society is complex, with a notable shift\nin  recent  times.  In  the  past,  many rulers were planetouched themselves, having risen to\npower   by  defeating  their  non-planetouched  predecessors.  However,  the  regulation  of\nplanetouched  by  the  second Fangaula Empire led to fear among some rulers, who saw the\nold days of planetouched domination as a threat to their power. This fear led to the hunting\nand  killing  of  the  planetouched by some. In situations of persecution, the most common\napproach  is  to kill planetouched while they are young or to hunt them down with the help\nof   magic   users   or  allied  planetouched.  This  is  because  it  is  believed  that  once  a\nplanetouched  has  matured,  they  will become too powerful to be stopped. In the past, the\nFangaula  Empire  hunted  down  planetouched who did not work with the empire, but this\norganization died with the collapse of the empire.\n\nFor  those  employed as anti-planetouched, a common approach is to keep track of rumors\nof  strange  babies  and  send  guards  to  investigate  the  city  or  village where the child is\nlocated,  to  kill  it.  This  is seen as a way of "nipping it in the bud." Finally, it is believed\nthat  planetouched  have  a  sense  of  "Divine  Right" in that once they have matured, they\ntypically  become  great  heroes  for  their  monarch or choose to kill the ruler and take the\nthrone for themselves.\n\n==== Theories on Inheritance and Creation ====\nThe  exact process by which a person becomes a Planetouched is still not fully understood.\nSeveral  theories  attempt  to explain the creation of Planetouched and its inheritance. One\ntheory  is  that  the  creation  of  Planetouched  is linked to the presence of genie relics and\nelemental  energy in specific regions. It is believed that exposure to this energy, particularly\nover  a  long  period, can cause a latent gene to awaken and change a person fundamentally,\ngranting them powers over a specific element."
 page_events.2551.t: "Planetouched 4 / 5"
 page_events.2551.d: "\n\nAnother  theory  suggests  that  Planetouched results from interbreeding between genies and\nhumans.  This  theory  is  based on the belief that genies can take human form and interact\nwith  humans,  which  could result in the creation of Planetouched offspring. The origin of\nthis  myth  can  be  traced back to the “Epic of Aro” in which Aro founds the first Fangaula\nEmpire,  as  the  son  of  a  bound  Dao.  Making  him a powerful earth planetouched. No\nrecords  have  been  able  to  be  produced to support this story, putting it into the realm of\nmythology.   The   inheritance   of   Planetouched  abilities  is  also  the  subject  of  much\nspeculation.  Some  believe  that it is passed down through generations through a dominant\ngene, while others think that it is a random occurrence that can happen in any family.\n\nThe  few  genies  asked  about  Planetouched origins have been either entirely dismissive or\nindifferent. Offering no real insight or explanation.\n=== Secrets of the Planetouched Excerpt ===\nExcerpt  from  the 1895 book "Secrets of the Planetouched” by the Kuino master poet sage\nNgolo Modibo\n\nPlanetouched in Sarhaly Culture\n\nWhile  the  nature  of  being a planetouched can occur amongst the civilized peoples of the\nworld,  the  people  of  Western  Sarhal  have  a  higher  than  usual  prevalence  of all four\nelements  of  planetouched  amongst  them.  Within  Western  Sarhaly  culture, and indeed\nmuch of Sarhal as a whole, those who are born with the strange attributes (an arm of stone,\nblue  skin,  gills,  flaming  hair) are either killed at birth due to fear or grow up to do great\nthings, be it a great warrior, cattle breeder, healer, mystic, warlord, artist, thief or poet.\n\nInheritance Theories\n\nWhy  is  the  blood  of planetouched most thick in the people of West Sarhal? It is said for\nevery  one  planetouched  elsewhere  there  can  be  three  or  more  in the Western Sarhal.\nWhatever  causes  a planetouched to to be "born", planetouched can not be “bred”, though\nmany  kings and queens have tried. The child of a planetouched does not inherit powers or\nappearance  of their planetouched parent but superstition believes the offspring will have an\ninnate  affinity  of  their  parent:  a  daughter of a water planetouched would be believed to\nbecome  an  amazing  swimmer  or  a  son  of  an  air planetouched may be more nimble or\nquick.  Despite  this, no matter how many prayers are made or how many rituals are cast, a\nprince or general is just as likely to be born a planetouched as a cattle herder or slave."
 page_events.2552.t: "Planetouched 5 / 5"
 page_events.2552.d: "\n\nStill  the  most  popular  theory  is  still  ancient  “inheritance”  within the bloodline of the\nWestern  Sarhaly  peoples.  It  is  said  that West Sarhal was a nexus of genie activity in the\ntime before time when the world was young and the Salahad desert was more green. We do\nnot  know  why  it  was  such a hotspot. Perhaps it was a gathering place for genies to settle\ndisagreements?  Or  simply  a  vacation  spot  for  powerful  elementals?  Or perhaps West\nSarhal's  position  between all four elements might have something to do with it. Whatever\nis the case Western Sarhal does have the highest density of genie artifacts and ruins from all\nfour   elemental   planes   (compared   to   the  Salahadesi  Desert,  which  has  mostly  air\ngenie/djinn   artifacts)  and  many  myths  and  stories  of  the  Sarhal  peoples  involve  an\notherworldly   helper,   villain,  patron  or  a  powerful  otherworldly  outsider  founding  a\nchiefdom's  dynasty.  Which  stories  are more fact than fiction is hard to judge but it gives\ncredence  to  planetouched  having  the  blood  of  these elemental elemental in their veins.\nSome  priests  have  alleged  that  planetouched are created by the lost spirits of the ancient\ngenies  unable  to  return  to  their  elemental  planes  who bind themselves with newborns.\nScholars  on  the  other  hand  suggest  that genies interbred with the ancient humans of the\nregion, and thus a latent gene more prevalent in the Western Sarhaly peoples is what causes\nthese  rare outbursts of planetouched. Whatever the case may be we will likely never know,\nas  even bound genies when asked are give contradicting answers or are largely uninterested\nof how the planetouched came to be.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

 page_events.1140.d: "\nPorcelain  is  a  ceramic  good  originating  from the aptly name Porcelain Cities along the\nKharunyana  in  Haless.  Porcelain  is  sometimes  referred to as 'Yana', after the river that\ngives its creators their home.\n\n== History ==\nWhile  the original inventors of porcelain were the artisans of Sempherong, they have since\nbecome  eclipsed  by their sister cities both in quality, like the masters in Khirapsid, and in\nquantity, like the burgeoning workshops within the slum-city of Sarisung.\n\nBy  the  17th  century  porcelain  exports  to  Cannor reached an all-time high due to safer\ntrade  routes  in  the  Serpentspine  and the reconstruction of the Golden Highway. Perhaps\nlearning  from  the  "borrowing"  of  silkworms by the Zanbari in 500 BA, the practices of\nporcelain-making  had  long been a guarded secret by the cities, and as such was naturally a\ntarget by Cannorian spies. One such incident ended with an execution of a Lorentish spy in\nKeyattordha  in  1699,  which  led  to Lorentish colonial officials to bribe the slave-state of\nBhuvauri  with  exclusive-trading  rights  and  crowns to abandon their protection contracts\nwith  the  cities,  leading  to  mass  sacking  of  the porcelain cities (and more importantly,\nporcelain guild workshops) in what is known as the Typhoon of Broken Vases. Luckily, the\ncity of Sempherong, the grandfather of porcelain, was being protected by other mercenaries\nat  the  time,  and  avoided  the  catastrophy,  causing  a  short  resurgence  in Sempherongi\ndominance in the porcelain trade.\n\n== Magical Storage ==\nDuring  the  Age of Witch Kings Porcelain became popular in the usage of magic, as it had\nbeen  discovered  and  confirmed  that  porcelain,  moreso  than  any  other  material,  was\nstrangely resistant to magic. Unlike Black Damestear, which nullified magic, porcelain was\nfound to be adept at storing it.\n\n\n"

The   majority   of  this  period  discusses  the  war  between  Aul-Dwarov  and  the\nPrecursors, including Ducaniel's continued campaign after the war ends.\n\n=== Civil War ===\nOne  of  the most pivotal events in Dwarovar history prior to the Aul-Dwarov war with the\nPrecursors  is  the  War  of the Bloody Gem in the year 6500 BA, a civil war erupting with\nthe addition of the Ruby gem to the Dwarovkron....\n\n=== War With the Precursors ===\nDeclared  in  6300  BA,  the  Precursor Empire and dwarven Empire of Aul-Dwarol would\nofficially go to war, with Precursor Fleets sailing from Aelantir.\n\nAs  Precursor  forces  shipped  over,  in 6284 BA the hold of Dûr-Vazhatun fell for reasons\nunrelated  to the war. These astronomers, fascinated by the precursor's creations, had spent\ndays  at a time gazing at the sky to catch glimpses of them. This fasciation quickly turned to\nmadness,  a  sickness known as Astral Terror. The hold fell to ruin, with the sane Sapphire\nDwarves  fleeing  to  Kar  Durghoir  ('Citadel  of  Dark  Ice', though present day known as\nHardy   Hole),   the   citadel   guarding  the  entrance  to  Giant's  Anvil  Mountain.  After\nregrouping they'd continue to Krakdhûmvor.\n\nWith  the  arrival  of  the  Precursor  fleet  in 6276 BA, Arethon, Precursor Emperor at the\ntime,  and  Aldan  blockade Ovdal Tûngr and encircle it. Sabotaging the hold, they create a\nlarge underwater explosion near it, flooding the mines before moving on to Shazstundihr. A\nyear  later  Ducaniel  marches  through  the  Harpy  Hills to the hold of Hul-Jorkad, laying\nsiege  to  it  with  his  own  forces.  After  a 47 year siege, in 6229 BA Mhoki Brightbeard,\nchampion  of  Shazstundihr,  slays  Emperor  Arethon  during  the  siege, routing Precursor\nforces.  Aldan  calls  for  peace  and breaks off the siege as a result of the Emperor's death.\nAlthough  Precursor  forces  stagnated  after the loss of the Emperor and the call for peace,\nDucaniel  had  managed  to  beach  Hul-Jorkad  in  6210  BA,  establishing  it  as  the first\nPrecursor  foothold  in the Dwarovar. The stagnation wouldn't last for long, as in 6200 BA\nthe  Precursor forces, save Ducaniel, would withdraw from the rest of the world and retreat\nto Aelantir."

Combining  magical  blood  with  their  rune magic, yielding what would be seen as\nboth  great  and  terrible  results.  The blood rune magic was unstable, causing the death of\nmany, dwarf and precursor. Despite it allowing the dwarves to push back Ducaniel's forces\nwith  ease,  the  costs  were  far  too  great  for  the  other holds of the Dwarovar, including\nAmldihr  and  High  King  Magni  IX,  Due  to Gor Dûrgheled claiming it was a necessary\nsacrifice  to  ensure  the  war was won and refusing the High King's demand in 6174 BA to\nabandon  blood  rune  magic,  Aul-Dwarov  would  cut  off contact with the hold until they\nwere no longer preoccupied with the war and could be dealt with.\n\nBy 6100 BA, without reinforcements, Ducaniel has been pushed back to the fourth level of\nHul-Jorkad  with  dwarven forces having had retaken the upper three floors. Ducaniel, now\ntrapped,  begins  his  orc  experiments.  The  Precursor  threat subdued, and Ducaniel now\ntrapped, Aul-Dwarov is able to turn their attention to the Obsidian Hold. In 6068 an army\ncomposed  of many of holds marched onto the Obsidian Hold. The Obsidian King, known\nfor  his  mastery of rune magic, and who's name has been lost to the ages, had prepared the\nlargest  runic circle recorded for one final spell. Gathering the entire hold in the circle, the\nObsidian  King  enacted  the  spell,  leaving but an empty hold for the Aul-Dwarovi forces.\nTransported  to  the  Underdark,  a  level  deep below where no dwarf had gone before, the\nObsidian King had been turned to a husk by the spell. Now regarded as the Runefather, he\nbecame the object of their worship, kept alive through faith and magic. This period, known\nas  "The  Harrowing  Times"  for  them,  was  one  where they would care a new home for\nthemselves in the Underdark. The other dwarves, witnessing the devastation brought by the\nspell,  abandoned  and  considered the hold unsafe. It was left to crumble over time and be\nforever  lost.  Even today, debate still follows who was truly the traitor, with many claiming\nAul-Dwarov  didn't  appreciate  the  Obsidian  Dwarves'  sacrifice,  and  others calling the\nblood rune magic immoral and unethical."

It\nwas  decentralized,  with  republics and kings all owning territory, but all acknowledged the\nPrecursor Senate. Venaan was elected as, officially, Rial(Ruler), but as the position was for\nlife,  it  was  technically an elective monarchy. The great city of Aesades was commissioned\nto  serve as a capital for the Empire around this time. It was completed around 2,000 years\nlater,  and  was  then  flown  around  the  continent, as to keep the government close to the\npeople.  c.  44,000  BA,  Venaan's  only  son,  Arethon,  was born. 4,000 years later, right\nbefore Arethon is considered an adult, Venaan dies, and Arethon ascends to the throne. He\nreformed  the  Empire,  creating  the  Precursor  Legions c. 38,000 BA, and centralizes the\nEmpire,   c.   35,000.   Kings   becoming  princes,  and  republics  become  election-based\ngovernates.  This  is  when  the  Precursor  Empire  is  truly born.

In 27,000 BA, contact with the Dwarovar is made, but\nrelations  rapidly  turned  hostile.  Precursor records claim that the Dwarves attacked first,\nwhile  Dwarven  records  claimed  the  Precursors  attacked  first.  Modern  scholars  have\ndetermined  it  was  Ducaniel.  Conflict began, resulting in the War of Ages. The war went\non for 2,000 years, until King Arethon perished in battle, in 25,000 BA.

The  blade themselves were crafted mainly from precursor steel, which\nwas  said  to  be  a  combination  of  mithril  for  its  flexibility,  steel  for  its strength, and\ndamestear for its spell-absorbing properties.\n\nEach  spellblade  is different due to the varied and bespoke requirements of its creators and\nwielders,  but  the  one  quality  that ties them together is that structurally, spellblades were\nweaker  than  ordinary blades or blades made of precursor steel in general due to its role as\na  spellcasting  foci.  To  achieve  this, the most common way was to in fact make the blade\nhollow   and   filled  with  a  pure  damestear,  which  was  then  strengthened  via  magical\nenchantments to make it on par with mundane blades.\n\nEach  blade has a unique Maker's Mark distinguishing them from other spellblades, though\nthere are few today who can identify these Marks.\n\n==Usage==\nAs  with  their  namesakes,  the spellblades were used as a casting aide, allowing the user to\ncast  and  direct  spells  with  the  blade, along with absorbing magical spells with the blade\nitself.  While  also  serving  the  practical  purpose of a regular blade, particularly powerful\nones were enchanted with unique properties enhancing their abilities.\n\nNotable  examples of their use include Calindal, "the Gleaming Blade" and Kongren, "the\nVoid's  Edge".  Calindal  is  not  only  seemingly  indestructible  and incredibly sharp, but\nflashes  bright  magical light when hit (the harder the hit, the brighter the light). The blade\nwas  used  as  a symbol of the Blademarches kingdom and had substantial influence in their\nhistory,  even  forming  an  Order  of the Blade Stewards who heralded a unique succession\nusing  the  "Test  of  the  Gleaming  Blade".  Kongren,  opposite  of  Calindal, didn't hold\nenchantments  but instead was made of Black Damestear and so holds the abillity to nullify\nmagical  items  and  spells  in its presence. The blade is capable of cutting through magical\nspells  to  dispel  them.  Due  to  this  unique power it is held under the stewardship of the\nJianxusi  in  Xianjie,  used only in the defense of the Xia. Another notable example, though\nnot  direct usage, is the unidentified spellblade in the head of Malenvijer, the Bladed Beast\nof   Mocvare,  which  has  created  a  Ynnic  legend  centered  around  it  despite  its  exact\ncapabilities  being  unknown.

It is known to be a very exact science, in that you can't\nmerely  melt  it  down and reforge it again. The techniques used to initially craft it must be\nreplicated  in  order  to  remake  a  spellblade  that  has  been  melted down. Exceptionally\npowerful  spellblades  were  crafted  using  damestear as a quasi-battery, capable of holding\nenchantments  such as Calindal's ability to produce light. Though they can be melted down\nfor precursor metal, their enchantments don't carry over in the process.\n\n==Bladedancing==\nThough mildly disputed, it is commonly agreed that Precursor spellblades were made prior\nto  the  art  of  Bladedancing,  or  Diranbe.  However,  many  do argue that it is the spirits\nteachings of Bladedancing that truly brought out the full potential of the spellblades.\n\n==Legacy==\nWhile  for  thousands  of  years  rare  artifacts after the fall of the Precursor Empire, by the\nAge  of  Gunpowder  owning  a  precursor  spellblade  has  become  more  so a ceremonial\nmilitary  ritual,  or  an  artifact  collected  by  a  wealthy  noble. Much of this is due to the\nre-colonization  of  Aelantir, the abundance of Precursor spellblades and relics found about\nthe  continents,  and  the  decline of mages on the battle-field. Many Cannorian companies\nsuch  as  the Vanbury Guild would come to export these blades back to Cannor, along with\nEordandi   and   Taychendi   Ruinborn   natives   trading  them  to  Cannorians  for  proper\ngunpowder  weaponry.  These  factors  lead  to spellblades becoming far more accessible in\nCannor.  Although  old  spellblades  recovered  from  Halcann  still had their old prestige,\nmany  of  the  amassed  Aelantiri  spellblades  were  as  good  if  not better in quality (with\nexceptions  such  as  Calindal).

 page_events.1174.d: "\nThe Predyvens System was a system of land division established by Arverynn in the decades\nfollowing  the  War  of  the Bacaran Succession. A ''Predyvis'' was a grant that temporarily\ntransferred imperial fiscal rights to an individual or institution.\n\n===Grant Types===\n\nPredyvis  fiscal rights were most commonly taxes or incomes from cultivated lands (such as\nthe  imperial  vineyards  of  Horpanas, or the fertile lands on the banks of the Moon Field)\nbut  they  could also be other income streams such as water and fishing rights, and customs\ncollection.  The various rights to a specific piece of geography could be granted to separate\nindividuals,  where  one  individual  could  have  the  rights  to  all revenues from the local\nstream, while another had the lumber rights of the forest on the same land.\n\n===Duration===\n\nGrants were for a set period, usually lifetime, and revocable at will by the Emperor. When\ninstitutions,  such  as  temples,  received grants they were effectively in perpetuity since the\ninstitutions  were  ongoing.  The  most  well  known  example of this was the Trom Throm\nRanch,  which  had  been  granted  all revenue from tolls along the Tromseloc Way. Grants\nwere  not  transferable or hereditary; a Predyvis gave the grantee possession, not ownership,\nwhich  remained  Imperial.  In  rare cases, Predyvis were granted to a house rather than an\nindividual, in which case it effectively became hereditary.\n\n===Usage===\n\nBuilt  upon  the  Zalagon  Pananek,  existing  feudal  land  laws,  and  experience  handling\nPomentere   Estates   since  the  formation  of  the  Veykodan  Guard,  the  system  was  an\ninnovation,  but  still  firmly feudal. It allowed Arverynn to frequently reorganize estates or\nrights  when  needed.  Often times, a Predyvis able to support a single Ynnic Knight would\nbe divided to support several infantrymen instead."

As\nthe  orcs  debated  which  route  would  be  most  prudent,  the  Blackened Prince made an\nappearance  glamoured  as  an  orc  and  managed  to  convince  some  clans  to  enter  the\nDeepwoods  as  a means to get around the fortress. The clans of Blackmoon, Cursed Howl\nand  Silentblade  along  with  some  minor  clans  formed the expedition to find this route.\nThrough the intervention of the Blackened Prince, the orcish host crossed the Verdant Veil\nand into the lands of Salla Myna.\n\nAfter initially succeeding against Salla Myna in open field, the orcs were left at a loss when\nthe  elves  barricaded themselves in their citadel capital, Ciranmyna.

The still\ndisguised  Prince  then  showed  Troknar  Silentblade,  the reigning chief of the Silentblade\nclan  the  gladeway  into  Salla  Fealgarn  which  brought  prestige to Troknar and solidified\nTroknar’s  trust  in  the  Prince.  From  his  position  as close advisor, the Prince leveraged\nTroknar  as  a  means  to  maintain orcish unity as the host rampaged through the groves of\nSalla Fealgarn and Salla Scotha.\n\n=== Attempt To Take Over The Greentide ===\nDespite  the  Blackened Prince's interventions, the countless and vicious battles around the\nDeepwoods combined with the knowledge that the orcs were trapped in behind the Verdant\nVeil  like  the  elves and goblins eroded the Greentide host's cohesion. Soon, even Troknar\nbegan  to  resist  the  Prince  by  questioning  the  still glamoured fey's advise. Tired of the\ninfighting,  the  Prince  magically dominated Troknar to challenge Gordak Cursed Howl to\ntake  over  his  clan.  As  the Blackened Prince was scheming, the Prince of Fools, another\nArchfey  commanded  one  of his followers, Oubblig, to ruin the Blackened Prince’s plans.\nThis  intervention  took  place  when  Troknar  challenged Gordak to Orzam’Chadash. The\nresult  was, instead of fighting to the death, the combatting orcs instead reveled and partied\ntogether.  With  the  duel  forgotten,  Cursed  Howl  left  the  Greentide and the infuriated\nBlackened Prince."

 page_events.1190.d: "\nRakhadesh,  once  known as the Land of Small Kingdoms, is a region of Haless and part of\nits sub-region, Rahen. Rakhadesh is mostly an arid and rugged region with the exception of\nsmall grassy areas surrounding the Dhenbasana and the Kharunyana rivers.\n\n==Etymology==\nRakhadesh  is  believed  to come from Ragha- meaning kingdom, and -desh meaning West.\nCombined,  the  meaning  ‘West  of  the  Kingdom’  refers  to  the region being the western\nregion of the Rahenraj.\n\n==History==\n===Early===\nOver  time  the  plains surrounding the Dhenbasana grew settlements which then developed\ninto  princedoms  before  submitting  to  Tivara  Svrinrangam  in  956  BA,  being  the last\nterritory  of  Rahen  he  obtained  before  forming  the  Rahenraj.  In 200 BA the Rahenraj\ndissolved  into  regional warlords. In 84 BA the neighboring dwarven Hold of Grôzumdihr\nwas abandoned, and the Peridot Dwarves therein dispersed into Rahen.\n\n===The First Harimraj===\nIn  the  year 1, the Day of Ashen Skies caused the ascension of the Harimari. Shortly after,\nin  35  Harimar united the fledgling Harimari and began a great conquest of Rahen. By 44,\nHarimar had conquered all of Rahen and founded the First Harimraj.\n\n===Warlords Period===\nBy  795  Jagaddipendra, the Black Bowman, Warlock of the West, had consolidated power\naround  his  palace near Saddathar and controlled most of Rakhadesh. He declared himself\nKing  of  the  Hills  and Plains and marched on the capital to usurp the Raj. Jagaddipendra\nsuccessfully  slew  the raja in 811, but this drew the ire of the lords of Rahen leading to his\ndemise.  The  death  of  the  raja  dissolved  the  Harimraj and led to a period of warlords.\nStarting  in  the  820s,  the  Siadanlen Queendom led by Ishtara Ivoryfeather conquered the\nGhankedhen  foothills up to lands bordering the Marutha using this as a staging ground for\nraids  into Rayavhashapal and Dhenijansar. In the 870s however, the Ghankedhen managed\nto  break  free  of  Siadanlen.  In  1038  the  Phoenix  Empire led by Jaher invaded Rahen,\nsweeping  along  the  coast  before  turning  North  toward  Rakhadesh  in  1051.  Prior to\ninvasion  in  1049,  the  tribes  of  Ghankedhen submitted to the growing Phoenix Empire.\nMost of Rakhadesh along with the rest of southern Rahen was conquered by 1059. The last\npart  of Rakhadesh around Bubhagama was conquered shortly thereafter as Jaher turned his\nfocus  North. Jaher died in 1127 following his conquest of Yanshen causing the collapse of\nthe  Phoenix  Empire’s  hold  over  Rahen  through  The  Sunset  Wars,  rebellions  by  the\ninhabitants of Rahen and Haless, and reverted Rahen back to a period of warlords."

By 1297 the kingdom had control\nover  the  plains  of  Rakhadesh  and  southern  Rahen.  Ramapalar  I  of  the  Lotus Claw,\ninheriting  the  kingdom  in  1297,  continued the conquest and over the course of 15 years\nhad  subjugated  the  remainder  of  Rakhadesh,  the  Ascension  Peninsula,  Dhugajir, and\nDhujat.  In 1312 Ramapalar proclaimed the founding of the Second Harimraj, at this time\nthe citadel of Bubhagama marked the northern extent of the Raj. From 1331 to 1340 there\nwere  failed  conquests  by  the  Raj  of city states to the South of Rakhadesh. In 1414 The\nSmothering  Sickness swept across Rahen killing off approximately a fifth of the population\nat  the  time,  including  the reigning Raja, Amanapurna II. In 1448 Manava of the Bloody\nClaw  died  in Rakhadesh while investigating corruption in a ministerial estate. Later in the\n1400s,  the  dwarven  hold  of  Grôzumdihr was restored, and the Peridot Dwarves created\nnew  tomes  to  record  the  treaties  that  were  since forged. 1481 marked the start of The\nWars of the Vizierate in which Amtujsaat and Rabhidaraj fought over the position of vizier.\nIn 1487 Guru Suhan started teaching his Praxis which denounced the caste system, creating\na rift in the theology of High Philosophy.\n\n===The Arrival of the Jadd===\nDuring   the   1520s   a   new   force  was  entering  Rahen  in  the  form  of  missionaries.\nMissionaries  of  The  Jadd  entered Ghankedhen and made significant work converting the\nGhankedhen  and  forging alliances between the tribes and the neighboring Jaddari Legion.\nThe  Jadd  quickly  became  the  predominant  religion  in  a  united, and Bulwar-oriented,\nGhankedhen.  In  1561  the  Dhenbasana  Uprising  fueled by Ghundagar as an attempt to\ngrab  power  provided  an  opportunity  for the rising power of the Jaddari Legion to invade\nRahen.  The  Jaddari  captured  Rayavhashapal  while  the  Raj’s  armies were busy with the\nrebellion.  In  1562 the armies of Rabhidaraj betrayed the Raja, allowing the Jaddari access\ninto  Dhenijansar. This led to the complete victory of the Jaddari and the dissolution of the\nRaj once more. Shortly after, the Jaddari subjugated the rest of Rakhadesh and declared the\nJadd  Empire.  In the 1680’s the Ghankedhen started to urbanize and started to build up an\niron  industry.  Later  on,  coal  was  found  in  the  Ghankedhen  town  of Sheramvi which\nbrought  on  increased  industrialization  with the help of dwarven engineers and Cannorian\nartificers."

Two other localities of note are Dhurasidheni and Bubhagama, both locations of a\nHigh  Temple  Complex.

Meanwhile,  Roose  found  no secrets but an old Ynnic\npriest  and  a  grim  prophecy:''"Flame cannot burn water. Sarda will fall. But not by your\nhand. And it will re-emerge. Stronger than ever."''\n\n==Consequences==\nEmperor  Calrodiy  VII  lost  hope  in  victory  against Corinsfield after the Red Night and\nproposed  an  armistice  that  the  Corinsfielders  swiftly accepted as they felt overextended\nwith  their  conquests. As Adbrabohvi fell and the spread of Ravelianism and its discoveries\ngrew wider in the Ynn, the native Ynn River Worship faith was further shaken.\n\nThe  Empire  of  Arverynn started to be seen as in decline, which made many Ynnics in the\nempire   lose   faith   in  the  Vyrekynn  leadership  of  Sarda.  Meanwhile,  the  victorious\nCorinsfield was nonetheless exhausted, and the weakness of both former belligerents would\nnot go unnoticed in New Havoral.\n\n===Plumstead's Opportunity===\nPlumstead   took   advantage   of   the  distracted  Arverynn  and  besieged  the  fortress  of\nSelocshana  during  Roose's  campaign,  an important stronghold of strategic importance to\nthe  Empire.  Not only was this the first time the fortress faced a modern Cannorised army,\nbut  the  Auvukonyr  mercenaries  it  relied  upon defected to the Plumsteader forces at the\npromise of full integration into their society."

 page_events.1205.t: "Redfoot Halfling 1 / 1"
 page_events.1205.d: "\nRedfoot    is    a    term   used   to   broadly   describe   the   halflings   who   live   in   the\nLorentish-influenced  southern  half  of  the Small Country, derived from the association of\nred with Lorent.\n\n==History==\nPrior  to  the  consolidation  of  what  would  become  the Redfoot lands under Lorent, the\nhalflings  of  the  southern  Small  Country  were  divided  into  three  cultural  groups: the\nRoyfoot  Halflings  of Roysfort and Bigwheat; the Ciderfoot Halflings of Appleton; and the\nHillfoot  Halflings  of  Thomsbridge  and  Coppertown.  Over  time,  Lorentish hegemony\ngained in these lands in the Tall Wars would meld these disparate peoples together, leading\nto the eventual emergence of the Redfoots as a distinct people by the First Lilac War.\n\n==Cultural Traditions==\nFrom  their Lorentish overlords and the mounted skirmishers of the Royfoots, the Redfoots\nhave  developed  a  reputation  for  being  skilled  pony  breeders.  Though diminutive, the\nponies of the south are sturdy, obedient, and swift. Redfoot ponies make up the bulk of any\nhalfling cavalry as well as draft animals throughout the Small Country.\n\nCastles  and  keeps  dot the countryside. The oldest of these are of Gnomish origin like the\nRoysfort;  newer  castles  are  done  in  the  Elven  style in imitation of the famous castle of\nAelcandar,  albeit  built  to  accommodate  their  defenders’  much  smaller size. Call them\ncraven, but Redfoots are skilled in castle defense, packing their keeps with traps, boltholes,\nand killzones while securing food and supplies for long sieges.\n\nThe  Applelords  of  Appleton  imprinted  Ciderfoot  customs  into  the  newer  culture  by\nindulging  in  the  extravagant  courtesies  of  Lorentish  nobility, an act quickly imitated by\nthose  in  Copperton  and  Thomsbridge.  As such, Redfoots are known for being charming\nand  unfailingly  polite,  generous  to  guests and friends alike with their hospitality, even as\nthey plot one’s demise with a pleasant smile on their face.\n"

 page_events.2592.d: "\n\n==History==\n===Origins===\nMany deities within the Regent Court draw origins from the early human tribes and settlers\nof  Cannor.  These  deities  often  had  different backgrounds and different names but what\nstayed  constant  was their portfolios (their sphere of influence, for example the portfolio of\nfire deals with all things relate to flame). For example, while several tribes and peoples had\ntheir  own  seemingly  separate  gods  of  war,  it  is  proposed  that  during  the  rise of the\nhegemonic  Castanorian  Empire  they all eventually merged into one dominating deity and\ndogma, in this case, the former god of war Agrados.\n\n===Castanite Exodus and Worship of Castellos===\nThe   foundations   of   the   pantheon   was   established   by   the   Castanite   peoples,  a\nconglomeration   of   slaves   fleeing   northwards   into  Cannor  proper  from  Sarhal  and\nKheterata.  The  group  was  not  so  much  a  people  in terms of ethnicity but in terms of\ncircumstance,  and  as  such were already a diverse group with already differing beliefs used\nto  working  together  for  the  common purpose of escaping slavery. It is suggested that the\nlarge  aggregation  of  deities  within  the pantheon derives from the diverse peoples already\nbearing the Castanite name.\n\nDuring  the  Exodus the Castanite people witnessed two miracles, the first during the Battle\nof  Burning  Hill in which the Castanites were trapped upon a burning hill by their gnollish\noppressors  and  saved  by  a gust of wind, blowing the flames back at the gnollish host and\ntheir  ruler,  the  demon-marked  Xhazobine. The second was during the The Lost Years in\nwhich  the Castanites found themselves lost within the Deepwoods forest, only to be shown\nthe  way  by  a  sighting  of the Silver Dragon of Castanor, said to be the avatar of Castellos\nhimself.\n\nDuring  this  period the worship of the deity Castellos began, which scholars claim to draw\norigin from the various law and war gods of the Castanites as well as the gods of their local\nEscanni allies (make up a random god here so I can name a province after him!)."

 page_events.1212.d: "\nThe  Rending  of  Realms,  or  "the  Rending"  for  short,  was a large-scale spiritual event\nspanning  the entirety of Haless from ~1751-1783 brought about by the Oni of Azjakuma's\nmagic and Cannorian adventurers drilling out the hearts of High Temples.\n\nAs   these  Temples  were  rendered  defunct,  their  wards  weakened  and  ultimately  fell,\nallowing  spirits  to  roam free. Although it was previously unknown, evidence collected by\nadventurers  and  chroniclers  who entered these Temples showed they were originally built\nby the Precursors in order to suppress Haless' spirits, most importantly the Great Spirits.\n\n==The Fall of the Temples==\nEven  prior  to  the Rending, Haless was in disarray due to the continued campaigns of The\nCommand and the arrival of Cannorian adventurers and imperial powers who had rounded\nSarhal, both of which would play significant roles in starting the Rending.\n\nThe  Command,  who  owned  from  North  Dhujat  and  Ghavaanaj  in  Rahen to most of\nYanshen  in  Haless  Proper,  including  virtually  all of Xianjie, was becoming increasingly\nthreatening,  and  increasingly  preoccupied  with  these multi-front campaigns. While The\nCommand  saw  no  benefit  from the High Temples and disregarded them, their loyal Oni\nsubjects  offered  their  mystical  knowledge  to  help  with  any  issues  that  these  Temple\ncomplexes   may  cause.  With  the  Command's  unprecedented  expansion  an  increasing\nnumber of High Temples coming under their control, and as such Oni's.\n\nHowever, thanks to their millenia-long tradition of deception, the horned ogres hid the fact\nthey  were  not  stabilizing them but secretly corrupting them to drain them of their power.\nThese  Oni  rituals  would tamper with and eventually "corrupt" the hearts of the Temples,\ngranting  the  Oni  the  power  of  the  contained  spirits  but  in return wearing away at the\nsuppressing wards.\n\nCannorians,  such  as  the  famous Indiboddo Jonesonn, on the other hand often sought the\nvaluable relics and artifacts within these Temples, breaking through defenses with the novel\ninvention  of the "Korashi Drill". These black damestear tipped drills allowed adventurers\nto breach the inner walls of the Temples and reach the hearts, without need for Oni magic.\nThe  Cannorians  gained access to a number of the High Temples through force, bribery of\nlocal   lords,   extortion,   and  various  other  techniques.  These  adventurers,  noting  the\nimmense  worth  of  the  Temple's  damestear  cores,  would  take  and  sell many of them,\ndestroying these Temple's wards and rendering them useless."
 page_events.2595.t: "Rending of Realms 2 / 4"
 page_events.2595.d: "\n\nThis, in tandem with the Oni's corruption, would continue to weaken the grid which barely\nstood  thanks  to  some  of its cornerstone temples; Smaraya, Tughayasa, and Tianlou. After\nSmaraya's  fall  in  the  Typhoon  of  Broken  Vases  in  1699/1700 came Tianlou in 1751,\nwhere  a local rich man's son who gambled away his money hired a party and a drill to raid\nthe  temple  during  the peace talks between the Command and Tianlou in Shengdao. With\ntwo  of  the  three  corners  destroyed,  Tughayasa was blasted open to eventually cause it to\nfully  break  down the grid and allow countless previously suppressed spirits to awaken and\nwreak havoc, much like water from a dam bursting.\n\n==The Rending==\n\nWith  the  destruction  of  the  High  Temple's warding grid, a violent shake was felt across\nHaless  which  left  most of the few remaining pristine temples damaged. In addition, what\nwould   come  to  be  known  as  Great  Spirits  began  to  awaken  across  Haless  in  now\nunprotected  zones  without  the  High  Temples'  warding,  each  one  capable  of  causing\nimmense  damage  along  with  bringing  waves  of  lesser  spirits  with  them. These Great\nSpirits,  previously either unknown or whose feats had been attributed to some other source\nnatural   or   supernatural,   now   appeared  in  corporeal  form,  legends  made  manifest.\nMountains such as Tughayasa are one such example of Great Spirits.\n\nMany  saw  this  as a sign that the barrier between the mortal plane and the spirit plane had\nbeen  "rend"  apart,  forcing  the  two planes into each other and giving the event its titular\nname.  It  wouldn't  be  long  before  a  connection  was  made between the destruction, or\nsurvival  of  Temples, and the frequency of spirit related events was made and the Temple's\ntrue purposes were realized.\n\nFor  regions  such  as  those  under  The  Command,  the  Rending  would be catastrophic.\nWithout  any remaining Temples to protect them the lands were quickly overrun by hostile\nspirits and the destruction brought about by Great Spirits, Kaloyan noted one such example\nin  his  writings such as the Great Catfish Spirit Kharunyana causing floods. Some, such as\nfollowers  of  the  High  Philosophy,  saw  this  as a sign that the chi of the world had come\nunbalanced  due  to  the  plundering  of  the high temples, while others such as followers of\nMystic  Accord saw this as a good advent. Of course, regions that had preserved their High\nTemples saw relative safety from these events but other nations turned to quick responses."
 page_events.2596.t: "Rending of Realms 3 / 4"
 page_events.2596.d: "\n\n==The Reaction==\nPrimarily,  affected  nations  were  forced  to figure out ways to ward or suppress the spirits\nthat  had  risen  about  their  land. Those with non-ruined Temples, as in those not in total\ndisrepair  or  had  their  hearts  tampered  with,  focused  on  repairing  the  Temples  after\ndiscovering  the  correlation  between  the  Temples  suppression and the rise of the spirits.\nWhen  the  Temples  were  repaired and restored, their wards were able to function in their\nrespective  zones  and  provide  local protection, though the Haless-wide grid would not be\nrestored   so   easily.   Another   option   available   to   these   nations   was   the   rise  of\n"spirit-hunters".  In  sufficient  numbers  these  mystics  were  able to suppress spirits, and\nsometimes even Great Spirits, to a degree that the grid would be able to restore itself in the\nparticular region so long as stability is maintained.\n\nFollowers  of  the  Mystic  Accord  however, saw the Rending in an entirely different light.\nThese  followers  believed  it  was  only  natural  for  spirits to live alongside mortals in the\nworld,  and  that  beings  such  as  the Great Spirits were simply a larger part of the natural\norder.  Many  of  these  followers,  who  were  focused in the Lupulan Jungles to the south,\nopted  to instead attempt to appease or strike up accords with these Great Spirits. Yinquan,\nas  written  firsthand by Chronicler Aleyissa Wu, was famous for both having had a positive\nrelation  with  spirits  and  having  come  under the leadership of the Great Spirit Huszien,\nreorganizing  itself  as Lingyuk ("Spirit Domain"). Those able to make accords with Great\nSpirits found themselves largely unaffected or even positively rewarded by these spirits.\n\nFinally,  as  they  had  prior  to the Rendering, the Oni and other followers of the Lefthand\nPath  sought  to  scour the remaining temples for their hearts and corrupt them. The rise of\nthese  spirits  also  allowed  for  more  sources  of  power  for  them,  as  they  were able to\nmanipulate  and  twist  the  spirits  that  rose as fuel for their magic. It is believed that they\nthought  by  corrupting  the  entirety of a Great Spirit's domain's Temples, the Great Spirit\nitself  might  be  harnessed by them and subdued to their whims. This could not ultimately\nbe   tested  or  seen,  as  despite  the  various  different  approaches  others  took,  all  were\nadamantly against such "hostile" practices."

 page_events.1218.d: "\nBayvic  (a Gerudian corruption of the Old Castanorian ''Baywic'', meaning ''Settlement by\nthe  Bay'')  is  a  major  city  in  the  Alenic  Reach.  Following  the Greentide, it took in a\nsignificant quantity of goblin refugees, which eventually led to its revival.\n\n==History==\n===Origin===\nBayvic  gained  independence  from  the  Kingdom  of  Adshaw  in  1001  during  the Blue\nReachmen Wars of Independence.\n\n===Goblin Immigration and Integration===\nBeginning  in  1463, Bayvic began to receive an influx of goblins migrating westwards from\nEscann.  While  many  Reachmen  viewed  them as monsters, Bayvic accepted them into its\nsociety  and  permitted  them  to  settle  in  the  city.  Over time, the goblin element within\nBayvic  grew  until  they  comprised a sizable minority within the Republic. Their efforts to\ndefend  the  city  alongside  their  human  counterparts were recognized in 1584, when they\nwere formally granted citizenship and the right to vote.\n\nGoblin  leaders  grew  increasingly  commonplace,  with  a  Bayvic-born goblin, Reb of the\nWestflowers,   attaining   the  [highest  office  in  the  city]  in  1602.  Under  Reb  of  the\nWestflowers   and  his  successors,  Bayvic  -  known  to  the  goblins  as  "Bayvek"  -  grew\nconsiderably,  both  as  a  mercantile  power and as a centre of goblin artificery. During the\n17th  century,  the  goblins  of  Bayvic  gradually assumed control over the city via repeated\nvictories in its elections, forming a powerful upper-class.\n\n===Bayvek===\nUnder  the  goblins,  Bayvek  became one of the richest cities in the Giant's Grave Sea and\nserved as a critical obstacle to the ambitions of the rising Gawedi Empire and its successor,\nthe  Northern  League. Bayveki industrialists clashed both in battle and business against the\nmagnates of the league, who were predominantly human purists.\n"

By the 17th century, the city was dominated by goblins, who\nslowly  took power in the elections of the republic. This new type of goblin, called the City\nGoblin,  went on to represent a civilized and mercantile type of goblin that assimilated into\nCannorian culture.\n\nBayvic  has long been a centre for traders and the leader of one of the most influential trade\nleagues  in  the  Reach. With the recent orcish invasion of the eastern Reach many refugees\nhave  fled  from  their homes and are moving into Bayvic, creating for us a large workforce,\nand  allowing  our  city ensure its place as the largest in the Reach. After all, if we are truly\nthe  example  of  what  a true Reachman city aspires to be, we must open our brethren with\nopen arms.\n\nThe process of making paper in Bayvic is no simple one, without any form of press or other\ntool  each  page  must  be  hand crafted, and the process is long and laborious. Despite this\nthe  profession  of paper-making has caught on in Bayvic, and thanks to the difficulty of the\nprocess  we  hold  a monopoly on the paper production in the Reach, and our reams can be\nseen from the Alen to Gerudia.\n\nThe  Gawedi,  famed  for  the  endless  armies  and  their great bravery, and the Grombari,\nfamed  for  their  ferocity and iron discipline, have both tried their hand at invading Bayvic,\nand both have been repelled.\n\nThe  Gawedi  found  them themselves harassed at every step by men all over the Reach (by\nour  guidance, naturally!), and while their soldiers outnumbered ours 10-ti-1, they were far\nfrom  home  and  their  resolve  did  not  match  our  own.  They were bled out slowly, but\ncertainly,  with  each passing day their forces dwindling until finally, unable to sustain, their\nlosses they were forced to withdraw."

Some Towerfoot, mostly among the rural population, felt\nthat  they  were  no  longer represented by their ruling class and decided to found their own\nrepublic  instead.  Following  a farmer by the name of Alvar Daxwell, they travelled up the\nBoek  river  until  they  reached  a  human  town,  established  on  the  site where the Boek\nruinborn of the western Trollsbay did their last stand.\n\nWith  the  halflings  being  much  more numerous, they quickly absorbed the small human\ncommunity  into the town of Rimsby, and proclaimed a republic named after their founder,\nthe state of Daxwell.\n\n=== Struggle for independence ===\nThe  proclamation  of  Daxwell's  independence  wasn't  received well in the Great Tower,\nwhich  offered  them to reintegrate Thílvis as an autonomous part of the country two weeks\nlater.  The  offer  was  rejected,  but  Thílvisan  tax  collectors  came  to  collect their dues\nnonetheless;   Daxwellian   settlers   forcefully   kicked  them  out  and  several  diplomatic\nincidents took place in the following years.\n\nAs  Thílvis  threatened  military  force,  Daxwell  received  military aid from the Lorentish\ncolony  of  Núr  Ionnidar,  sent  through the neighboring republic of Spoorland, which was\nestablished  at  the  same  time as Daxwell. The Spoorlanders also pledged to provide their\nunconditionnal  support  to  form  a  common  front  against  the  Thílvisans. After several\nskirmishes,  it  was  clear  the  new  republics  would  stay  independent  save  for an actual\ninvasion,  and  Thílvis  did  not  want  to risk Lorentish intervention. The independence of\nDaxwell was thus secured.\n"

They are infamous for their historic\npractice of piracy and their axe-men.\n\n==History==\nIn  825,  Reaverking  Askel arrived at Reaver’s Landing, seizing the northernmost provinces\nof  the  Kingdom  of  Iochand.  They  would  go  on  to  take  the  Gnomish Pass from the\nKingdom  of  Eaglecrest,  founding  the  Kingdom  of  Reveria.  While  the Dalric Reavers\nadopted  the Cannorian Pantheonic faith and the Common tongue of their native Iochander\nsubjects,  Reverian  peoples  retained  more  of  their  old Gerudian customs than the other\nReaver-descended Derannic and Pearlsedger cultures did.\n\nThe  Reverians  extended  across  much  of  the  southern Dragon Coast over the following\ncenturies,  assimilating  the  remaining Iochanders north of the Portroy River following the\nSack  of  Iochand  in  1264.  The  Portroy  Agreement  signed  with  Lorent  halted further\nReverian  incursions  south  of  the river. This period of dominance would come to an end,\nhowever,  when  they  were  driven  out  of  the  Gnomish  Pass  by  the  Cliff  Gnomes  of\nNimscodd in 1396 with the aid of Gawed.\n\n==Society==\n\nReaver blood runs strong among Reverians, and they are proud of it; beyond a close affinity\nwith  the  western  seas  where  many  fish  and  trade, they also historically maintained the\npractice  of  raiding  and  piracy.  Reverian  captains were often hired as privateers by other\nnations  to  wreak  havoc  on  their  rivals’  trade,  while their mercenaries worked as shock\ntroop units with their ferocity and courage.\n\nAxes  have  long  been  the  preferred weapon of Reverian soldiers, their footmen famed for\ntheir   skill.  Even  when  cavalry  innovations  led  to  their  axe-men  becoming  obsolete,\nReverians  developed  the  poleaxe  to  answer the growing use of cavalry charges. Later on,\nthe axe-pistol would become an infamous symbol of the Reverian armies and as a reminder\nto all of their Gerudian elite huscarl heritage."

Reverians supplement the crops they have\nreaped  with  freshly-caught saltwater fish and imported Lorentish wine; when feasting, it is\nnot  uncommon  for  them  to tell tall tales of adventure and ancestral exploits in a manner\nakin to the Skalds of Gerudia.\n\nThe  Reverians  maintain  a  friendly  disposition  with  the  halflings of the Small Country,\nespecially  those  of  Appleton,  welcoming  them  as  laborers and farmhands in peace and\nhiring  their  mercenaries  in  times  of  war.

According  to  local  residents  she would gained the nickname "Crone" due to this,\nbeing  a  secluded  girl in the woods she was teased using this name by the other kids of the\ntown  she  lived  nearby.  As  she  grew,  the name stuck with her and she would even begin\nusing  it  herself  as  a badge of honor, using it to separate her from those of that town. The\ntown itself being a logging town she was often at odds with the residents, wanting to protect\nand preserve the woods along with the animals within it.\n\nMuch  of  her life would change at 12 years old, when returning from a trip to the forest at\nnight  to  see  adventurers  confronting  her  father  in front of their cottage. She writes that\nthese  adventurers  had  come  for  her  mother,  who  as  it turns out was a werewolf, these\nadventurers  quickly  slew her father who attempted to stop them and broke into her house,\nkilling  her  mother  too  who  had  been  supposedly  chained  in the basement for the full\nmoonA Life On The Hunt by Robyn "Crone" Wolfden .\n\n==Activism==\nMany of the years after her parent's deaths being lost, her name would re-emerge in reports\nby  several  magnates  in  regards  to  her  spreading  general  unrest and discontent in their\nlands.  She  is  rumored  to have caused the collapse of several coal mines although no case\nwas proven along with starting a petition against adventurers in forests such as Wolfden's.\n"

 page_events.2629.d: "\nIn  her  later  years  she  would  turn to writing as an outlet for her opinions, writing works\nsuch  as  "The  Beasts  of  Cannor" and "Along the Alen". These, her most famous works,\nwere  generally  regarded negatively due to the popularity of adventurers along with the fact\nthat  the  Northern  League  was quickly rising in power in Cannor. She would continue to\nhold protests until she retired to her childhood cottage in 1873.\n\n==Rumors of Lycanthropism==\nIt  was  widely  spread  and  suggested  by  her  opponents  such  as  adventuring guilds and\nmagnates  that  she was a werewolf herself, explaining her concern for the environment and\n'beasts'  such  as  werewolves. Her mother being a werewolf swayed many to believe this to\nbe true and discredit her work to these believers. Others took her writings with more truth,\nbelieving  her  to  hold  a  first-hand  perspective  that  they  had often not considered, only\nthinking of these 'monsters' as animals.

After  leaving  Dameria,  he\nestablished  the  Sons  of Dameria adventurer company, and fought alongside Corin against\nthe Greentide. The Escanni kingdom of Rogieria, established by the Sons, was named after\nhim.\n\n== Early Life ==\nBorn  in  1406  as  the  third  son  of  Grand Duke Adénn Silmuna and his wife Calassa síl\nDeranne,  Rogier’s  early  life  was  defined  by  the  Lilac  Wars. From an early age he was\ntrained in combat by Ricain "the Brash" Silistra, considered one of the greatest warriors of\nhis  time.  After  training,  he  spent  his  free  time reading treaties of warfare and military\norganization, knowledge which proved useful during his later life in Escann.\n\nAt  the age of 12, he accompanied his father to Verne, where he met Trystan sína Redcoast,\nthe  son of a member of the lower Vernman nobility. Both became friends and kept contact\nwith letters.\n\nIn  1422,  when Rogier was 15, his grandfather, Emperor Vincen “the Old Owl” died, and\nin  the  same  year  during  the  Battle  of  the  Moon Council, his two older brothers were\nkilled, leaving Rogier as the oldest living child of Adénn.\n\n== Lilac Wars ==\nDuring  the  4th  Lilac War, he served as a squire to Alvar IV, the Duke of Verne, and was\nknighted  by  him  in  1427.  As the war progressed, he became known as a skilled warrior\nand a decent military commander, winning several minor battles in the Eastern Dameshead\nagainst the imperial members of the Rose Party.\n\nIn  Verne  he  was  reunited  with  Trystan, and both fought and were knighted together. At\nsome point between 1427 and 1443, Trystan became Rogier’s lover.\n"

 page_events.2630.d: "\nIn  1443, Rogier was injured after a battle against the Cestiranders in Verne when the news\nof  the fall of Anbenncóst and the death of his family arrived. The newly crowned emperor,\nLothane  síl Wex, offered the remaining Silmuna loyalist safe passage through the empire if\nthey  agreed  to  go into exile in Escann, and put a bounty on Rogier’s head. With Dameria\ndestroyed,  Rogier  decided  to  try  to  find  the  last  surviving  member  of his family, his\nyounger  sister  Eílis,  who  was  in  Castellyr  as  a  lady  in waiting at the beginning of the\nGreentide.\n\nFaking  Rogier’s  death,  the  Silmuna  army led by Trystan and Laurenne sil na Damesdale\nmarched   to   Arbaran,   followed  closely  by  Wexonard  troops,  until  they  reached  the\nencampment of the Marcher Lords. Once there, Rogier used the few remaining contacts he\nhad  to find information about his sister, to determine if she was still in Escann or was able\nto escape with other refugees.\n\n== Fighting the Greentide ==\nOnce  safe  in  Escann, Rogier revealed himself and founded the adventurer company of the\nSons of Dameria, formed by his soldiers and other Damerian exiles.\n\nThe  victory at Rottenstep cemented Rogier’s ability as military commander, since the Sons\nof  Dameria  hold  the  left  flank  against  the  orcish  horde.  This  success attracted more\nDamerian exiles to the Company.\n\nLothane  was  already famous between the Marcher Lords when he met Rogier. He was the\nson  of  Eílis, Rogier's younger sister, and after their meeting, Rogier decided to legitimace\nLothane as a member of the Silmuna family, and named him his heir.\n\nAfter the battle of Castonath, Rogier led the Sons of Dameriaback to the west, and in 1447\nmanaged  to  conquer the city of Taranton from the Grasshopper Muncher goblin tribe. He\nmade  the  city  his center of operations, since it was relatively intact, including the walls of\nthe  citadel.  In  the  following years, the Sons managed to conquer the central Taran plains\nand  eastern  Rohibon  from  the  orcs and goblins. The city proved to be key, as Taranton’s\ncitadel  gave  the  Sons  a safe base of operations from which to pursue the fight against the\nremnants   of  the  Greentide.  From  there  Rogier  proved  to  be  a  good  administrator,\nestablishing  trade  routes  with Cannor and other marcher lords, with the Sons keeping the\nroutes open and free from orc raidings."

 page_events.1268.d: "\nThe  Roilsardi  are  a  Lencori  human  people who live in the region of Roilsard along the\neastern  Bay  of  Wines. As a people that straddled the borders of Lencenor and the Empire\nof  Anbennar,  the  Roilsardi  have  historically  used  their  position  of  mediacy  to  their\nadvantage, often to the detriment of the Lorentish crown.\n\n==History==\nThe Roilsardi descend from an ancient Lencori tribe of the same name, though centuries of\ncontact  with  other  Lencori peoples and Damesheadic nations like Dameria have left their\nheritage  more  mixed.  Like  the  other  tribes  of  the  Western  Dameshead,  for much of\nantiquity they were vasalans under the Damerian Republic, adopting the Common language\nduring  this  time.  When  its  successor, the Lencori Empire, collapsed in 480, the ancient\nRoilsardi were unable to unify and claim a kingdom of their own, their fractured chiefdoms\nsubjugated  under the Tretunic Kingdom. The Tretunic Kingdom and its western neighbor,\nthe  Lorentish  Kingdom,  had a cordial relationship, as seen through their joint invasion of\nthe  Carnetori  Kingdom.  This  would  change  with  the  Era  of  Black Ice, when Henrik\nDivenscourge  seized  the  eastern  half  of Tretun, establishing the Kingdom of Pearlsedge.\nDrastically  weakened,  Tretun could no longer keep its Roilsardi vassals under control; the\nRoilsardis  dynasty  united  the  lands  and  declared  the Petty Kingdom of Roilsard. With\nReavers  wrecking havoc in Lencenor and Lorenan’s descendants fighting one another in the\nWar  of the One Rose, the Roilsardi experienced a 21-year period of peace, later called the\nregion’s silver age.\n\nLorent  was  eventually reunified and began a long series of campaigns trying to incorporate\nthe Roilsardi into the kingdom against their will. Though Lorent triumphed in the end, the\nnobles  and  commoners  alike remained belligerent towards their new overlords. Frequent\nuprisings  led  to military reprisals, which spawned more acts of revenge from the Roilsardi\nand  thus  more  heavy-handed  actions from the Lorentish, on and on in a vicious cycle. It\nwas  this intermittent violence that caused so many Roilsardi to participate in the Aldresian\nCrusade.  While some did simply wish to end the White Pestilence, many more were eager\nto  gain glory and lands of their own in the Borders, far away from Lorentish rule.

Among themselves they are a quarrelsome people, eager to\npick  a  fight  and  spill  blood.  In  spite  of this, the Roilsardi of the Eastern Winesbay are\nsavvy enough with diplomacy to pit the rivalries of Lorent and Dameria against one another\nto maintain their privileges and autonomy.\n\nIn  regards  to  warfare, Roilsardi had a martial tradition of maintaining polearm regiments\nthat  were  highly  effective  against  the cavalry units used by their long-standing rivals, the\nLorentish.  For  much  of  their  history,  this anti-cavalry sentiment bled into the Roilsardi\nthemselves,  eschewing  mounted  warfare  in favor of spearmen. Later, mixed regiments of\ngunmen and pikemen would form the bulk of their armies.\n\nAs  a  passionate  and  hot-blooded people, they are notable among the Lencori as for their\nadventurous  spirits,  lusting  for  glory,  fortune, and more carnal pleasures. Child-making\nwas  not  as  taboo  in  Roilsard  as  it  was  in  other  locations  in  Cannor,  leading to the\nstereotype  of  Roilsardi as debauched. Unsurprisingly, the Roilsardi venerated Minara and\nAra especially among the Cannorian Pantheon due to their ties with luxury and excess. The\nRoilsardi   penchant   for   having  large  families  was  in  part  the  reason  why  so  many\nRoilsardi-descended  communities  grew and retained their customs so readily. In addition,\ndue  to  their  closer  political  ties  with Dameria, they would also count the Dame among\ntheir key religious figures.\n"

The  ruler  of  Gor  Dûrgheled,  the  Nameless  King,  refused to allow the\nmassacre  of  his  people  and gathered the holds population into a giant runic circle he and\nhis  fellow runesmiths created, and cast a spell that sent them into deepest parts of Halann,\nthe  Primeval Serpentdepths. The Nameless King's mind and body were broken, and where\nhe  stood  was  only a husk that the Obsidian Dwarves called the Runefather. His body was\nset  atop  the  Obsidian  Throne,  kept alive through faith and magic, waiting for the day he\ncan once again lead his people to the surface world.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

 page_events.1285.d: "\nRyala  is  the  Regent  Court  virginal  goddess  of  true  love, beauty, and purity. She is the\ndaughter  of  Castellos  and  Esmaryal  and the sister of Adean. It is said that Ryala has the\nhighest  count of avatars to this date and that many wars have been caused under her name.\nRyala  is  also the creator of the deity Minara, who was originally an avatar of hers who she\nturned into the goddess of lesser love and celebrations.\n\n= Appearance =\nRyalas classical depiction is of a beautiful woman, clad in an almost glowingly white dress.\nGolden   rings,   flowers,   and  the  Ryalan  Heart  symbol  usually  accompany  her.  Her\nappearance  frequently varies between different regions and times, as she is representing the\nideal   beauty.   A   depiction   of  Ryala  in  a  pre-landing  temple  in  Esmaria  will  look\nconsiderably different from a depiction in a contemporary temple in Cestirmark.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Cannorian Myth ===\nAccording  to  the Cannorian Creation Myth, Ryala was created by Castellos and Esmaryal\nfrom  the  massive  energies  released  during The Godswar. Immediately taking the side of\nher  father  Castellos  in  the  war, she inherited part of the fallen goddess Hedine's former\npowers, and domains, sparking an eternal rivalry between the two.\n\n=== The Interregnum ===\nThe  Order  of  The  Unblemished Maiden was established in the year 1208 by Leithia the\nFirst,  to  spread  the virtues of Ryala across Esmaria. Initially formed to aid the defense of\nthe  Duchy  of  Ryalanar, the order gained land in Loveswood and became the militant arm\nof  the  Ryalan  Temple.  In  1270,  after  Ryalanar  fell  into  the  hands  of  the  Duke  of\nThemarenn,  the  order  joined  forces  with  the  temple  in  a  revolt  that  resulted  in the\noverthrow  of the Duke. Since then, the order has served as the standing guard and military\nforce of the Ryalan Temple.\n"

 page_events.2640.d: "\nFollowing  the  Temple's  sovereignty, a statute called "The Ryalan Privilege" was enacted.\nNegotiated  by  Priestess  Kerstie  of  Tretun,  it  granted  the  Temple  the  right to govern\nRyalanar  Proper  and  Loveswood  in  exchange  for  blessing  all Emperors' weddings and\nproviding   final   authority  on  matters  of  marriage  legitimacy  and  divorce  among  the\nAnbennarian nobility.\n\n=== Era of Greentide ===\nDuring  the  Era  of  Greentide,  Ryala  gained  a significant following in the newly formed\nnation  of  Ravenmarch  and caught the attention of The Sisterhood of Ryala's Smile. They\nwere  a  religious  organization  that  was  dedicated  to upholding the tenets of Ryala, even\namong orcs and goblins, who were considered evil by most temples at the time.\n\nDuring  the  reformative  movement of Corinite beliefs in Ravenmarch, the Sisterhood had\nembraced  the  ideals  of Corin. However, their devotion to Ryala and the death god Nerat\nremained strong, forming a triarchy of faith that emphasized life, war, and death.\n\n=== The Lovelost Schism ===\nAs  the  discovery  of  Castellos  death,  and the Corinite Wars that followed raged through\nCannor  the  entire  Regent  Court  faith  was  divided.  The  Temple  of  Ryala  wasn't  an\nexception, and the Ryalan Temples were split between the Corinite and Adeanic factions.\n\nThe  schism  is  believed  to have originated as a dispute over the marriage rituals practiced\nby   the   Escanni  people,  which  were  deemed  invalid  by  the  Temple  of  Ryala.  This\ndeclaration  by  the  temple  was  seen as a dismissal of decades of established tradition and\nceremonial practices.\n\nThe crux of the disagreement lay in the stark contrast between the viewpoints of the Temple\nof  Ryala  and  the  Escanni.  The temple advocated for strict adherence to formal and rigid\nmarriage  rituals,  emphasizing  the  importance  of  following prescribed procedures. They\nargued  that  deviating  from  these rituals would undermine the sanctity and significance of\nmarriage."
 page_events.2641.t: "Ryala 3 / 10"
 page_events.2641.d: "\n\nOn  the  other  hand,  the  Escanni  population, driven by a desire to prioritize genuine and\nauthentic  love,  felt  that  the  existing rituals were excessively austere, lacking warmth and\nemotional  connection.  They  believed  in  celebrating  love  in its truest form, valuing the\nessence  of  the  relationship  over  adherence  to  rigid  ceremonial practices. To them, the\nrituals  seemed impersonal and detached from the genuine experiences and emotions of the\ncouples involved.\n\nThe schism developed into a deep divide between the nobles and urban, wealthier followers\nof   the  Empire  of  Anbennar,  and  the  more  rustic,  rural  population  of  Escann.  The\nurbanites,  who  were  generally  more  traditional  in their outlook, sought to maintain the\nexisting  social  order,  where physical beauty was predominantly associated with those who\nhad the means to conform to societal beauty standards.\n\nIn  contrast,  the  rural  followers  held  more  progressive views, seeing beauty as a quality\naccessible to anyone regardless of their social standing or material resources. They rejected\nthe  notion  that  beauty  should  be  confined  to  external appearances and emphasized the\nimportance  of inner beauty, such as kindness, integrity, and compassion. For them, beauty\nwas  a  journey  of self-discovery and personal growth, open to all individuals, regardless of\ntheir  background  or  economic  status.  They  argued  that the traditional Ryalan doctrine\nmade  sure that “beauty” was exclusive and limited to those who could afford it, reinforcing\nexisting hierarchies and granting privileges to the elite.\n\nIn  an effort to address the internal tension and division caused by the Lovelost Schism, the\nTemple  of  Ryala  undertook  a  significant  step  towards  reconciliation.  Recognizing the\nvalidity  and  value  of  the  Escanni  traditions  and  philosophies,  the  temple  decided to\nincorporate them into its broader teachings.\n\n=== Temple of Heavenly Matrimony ===\nAs  the Ravelian faith started gaining ground in both Cannor and Aelantir, some temples of\nthe  Regent  Court  converted wholly to the new faith. One of those temples would become\nthe  main  branch  of converted Ryalans, and renamed themselves The Temple of Heavenly\nMatrimony.  It  is  considered  a sacred institution within the Ravelian faith. It upholds the\nsanctity  of  marriage  as  one  of the highest expressions of devotion to both God and one's\npartner."
 page_events.2642.t: "Ryala 4 / 10"
 page_events.2642.d: "\n\nWith the transition of some Ryalan Temples into the Ravelian faith and the canonization of\nRyala  as  a  saint,  the  high  priesthood made a significant decision to rename the temple.\nThis   renaming  emphasizes  the  profound  significance  of  the  act  of  matrimony  itself,\nredirecting the focus towards the devotion and commitment shared between spouses, rather\nthan solely on the former goddess Ryala.\n\n=== Contemporary Criticism ===\nOne  of  the  central  issues  raised  by  modern critics is the expectation imposed on young\nwomen  to  conform  to  specific  beauty ideals. The Ravelian Valorman professor Eduardo\nMorellsi  argues  in  his  1895  essay  "Body  and  Soul",  that  the  emphasis  on  physical\nappearance    within    the    temples    of    Ryala    can    contribute   to   what   he   calls\n“dysmorphophobia”.   A   condition   characterized   by  an  obsessive  preoccupation  with\nperceived flaws in one's appearance. The relentless pursuit of physical beauty, as promoted\nwithin  these spaces, can lead to an unhealthy obsession with attaining unrealistic standards\nof attractiveness.\n\nThis,  in  turn,  can  contribute  to  the development of depression and other mental health\nissues.  Eduardo  argues  that  the temples' focus on outer beauty detracts from recognizing\nand  valuing  women's  diverse  qualities  and  achievements  beyond  their appearance. By\nexcessively   emphasizing  physical  attractiveness,  the  temples  perpetuate  a  narrow  and\nlimiting  view  of  womanhood, disregarding the multifaceted nature of individual identities\nand experiences.\n\n== Relationships ==\nRyala is the daughter of Castellos and Esmaryal, and the brother of Adean. This familiarity\nalso extends to her mortal followers and temples, and they all maintain close relations.\n\nThis  is  equally  true  towards Minara, as she is a part of Ryala herself. Even though many\nassume their temples are opposed in their teachings, they both recognize they represent two\ndifferent  sides  of  the  same  whole  and  choose  to  work  in tandem, united against their\ncommon enemy."
 page_events.2643.t: "Ryala 5 / 10"
 page_events.2643.d: "\n\nRyalas  most  ancient  enemy  is the archdevil Hedine, the fallen former goddess of joy and\ncelebration,  turned  Mistress of Lust. She thrives on corrupting and defiling the purity and\nbeauty in the mockery of Ryala and Minara both.\n\n== Religion ==\n\n=== Avatars ===\nRyala  would  split  her  powers  with  a  mortal  Avatar  known  as  Minara.  She took the\nresponsibilities of celebrations, and joy, and lesser love so that Ryala could dedicate herself\nto beauty, true love, and purity.\n\nThe  second  most  famous  Avatar  of Ryala, second to Minara, was Laurenne Ryalan. She\nwould  trigger  an  all-out  war between several nations due to her otherworldly beauty. She\nwould  commit  suicide  by  falling on her dead husband's sword, suffering total heartbreak\nafter finding him slain in battle due to the war.\n\nOther legends of the avatars of Ryala also reveal that men have gone to great lengths to win\ntheir  favor.  In  a  notable  conflict  between  the  Duchies of Cestirande and Istralore, the\nEmperor  intervened  and  declared  a  contest  of  affection to settle the matter. The avatar\nherself  would  choose her suitor, marking the first diplomatic solution to a conflict for the\nhand of a Ryalan avatar.\n\n=== The River Ryal ===\nThe  springtime  floods  of  the  Ryal  River  in old Ryalanar hold a significant place in the\nreligious  and  cultural beliefs of the region and are also believed to be a source of many of\nRyalas avatars. It is a natural phenomenon that occurs during spring thawing when the Ryal\nRiver  overflows  its  banks,  reaching  heights  nearly  twice  as  high as nearby rivers. The\nconsistent  and predictable nature of these floods has led many to consider them more than\njust a natural occurrence but a holy event."
 page_events.2644.t: "Ryala 6 / 10"
 page_events.2644.d: "\n\nThe  significance  of  the  floods  goes  beyond  their religious connotations. The consistent\nnature  of  the  flooding  has  gained  the  attention  of natural scientists within the Empire.\nThrough  meticulous  observation  and study, they have been able to predict the river levels\nduring floods with remarkable accuracy, often within an infinitesimal margin of error. This\nscientific  understanding  has further reinforced the belief in the sacred nature of the floods\nand deepened the reverence for Ryala's influence.\n\nThe  villages  and  towns  that  line  the banks of the Ryal River have also been witness to a\nnotable  number of avatars of Ryala throughout history. Some attribute this to the increased\npresence  of  Ryalan  clergy  in  the  area  during the floods, as they gather to recognize and\ncelebrate  the  emergence of these divine manifestations. Others believe that the river itself,\nblessed by Ryala, plays a role in attracting and guiding these avatars to the region.\n\n=== The Temples ===\nTemples dedicated to Ryala reflect the divine essence of their patron goddess. These sacred\nspaces are adorned with lavish halls, exquisite decorations, and a serene ambiance. Clothed\nin  pure  white  fabric and adorned with fresh flowers in vibrant shades of pink and red, the\ntemples emit a subtle perfume or incense. The colorful windows allow bright light to bathe\nthe  interiors,  creating  an  ethereal  atmosphere.  Many  artworks  and  items symbolizing\nbeauty  are  displayed  in these temples, celebrating the divine manifestation in the material\nworld.  They  are  usually  designed so that you can always gaze upon the large depiction of\nRyala at its center. Symbolizing her ever present beauty in all things.\n\n=== Priesthood ===\nThe  Temple  of  Ryala  traditionally  only  allows  women to serve as priestesses. They are\nmost often dressed in pure white robes or habits, with red or pink accent colors. Many also\nwear  flowers  as part of their clerical dress. Their hair is uncovered, or covered with a thin\nwhite veil, and is made up in complex and intricate styles.\n"

 page_events.2645.d: "\nThe  Temple  of  Ryala  welcomes  all  women  who  wish to learn about Ryalan values and\ntraditions.  Ryalan  temples  often  function  as informal schools for aspiring courtiers, and\nthose who prove their beauty and purity may join in the ranks of Ryala's faithful. While the\npriestess's  primary  duty revolves around officiating marriages and blessing young couples,\ntheir  responsibilities extend beyond ceremonial functions. Ryalan priestesses actively strive\nto  ensure  the  longevity  and  strength  of  love  between  couples.  They serve as marriage\ncounselors,  offering  guidance  and  support  to  couples  seeking  to rekindle their love or\nnavigate challenging times. Additionally, priests provide similar services to individuals who\nhave  experienced  heartbreak  or  lost  hope  in  finding  love. Some temples even organize\ngatherings  of lonely or heartbroken individuals to foster connections and ignite love within\ntheir  community.  The Ryalan Temple is also traditionally the final authority on matters of\ndivorce and marriage legitimacy, especially amongst the Noble class.\n\nArt   and   beauty  hold  particular  significance  within  the  Ryalan  Temple,  as  they  are\nconsidered  the  creation  and  manifestation  of  the  divine in the material realm. Inspired\nmoments  of artistic fervor are often seen as gifts from Ryala, a way for her to infuse beauty\ninto  the world. Priestesses of Ryala are all accomplished artists in their chosen disciplines,\nand  aspiring initiates must create a single piece of "true beauty" as a final test before being\nordained  as priestesses. They must also be deemed beautiful and pure, from the inside and\nout.\n\nWhile  Ryalan  followers  value physical beauty, the priestesses of Ryala also emphasize the\ncultivation  of  inner  beauty.  They  assist  each  follower  in discovering and nurturing the\nunique qualities that make them beautiful. All priestesses are sworn to refrain from judging\nindividuals  based on appearance or behavior, as the Ryalan Temple views true beauty as an\nongoing journey rather than a static destination.\n\nThe  Temple  of  Ryala  acknowledges  that true love encompasses more than just romantic\nrelationships.  It  also  encompasses  the  passion  for  artistic  pursuits,  the  platonic  love\nbetween   friends,   and  the  love  for  one's  work,  among  other  manifestations.  Ryalan\npriestesses are encouraged to promote and cultivate these diverse aspects of true love within\ntheir followers. Though many see their primary divine calling as pure romantic love."

 page_events.2646.d: "\n\nPriestesses of Ryala are traditionally not allowed to marry or engage in physical intimacy as\nlong  as  they  serve  the  Temple.  While  love is encouraged, purity and beauty are also of\nequal  importance. It is therefore common for priestesses to graduate from their duties and\nstart  serving  another  temple,  most  often  the Temple of Esmaryal, as they start families.\nThis  isn’t  considered  sinful  or  shameful  by  either  Temple  but is regarded as a natural\nevolution of pure love.\n\n=== Followers ===\nWithin  the  followers  of  Ryala,  a  clear  distinction  exists  between  urban and wealthier\nadherents   and  their  more  rustic  rural  counterparts.  Urban  followers  often  prioritize\nexternal beauty and its enhancement, while rural communities emphasize inner beauty.\n\nTypical  offerings  to  Ryala are objects of beauty, like art pieces, gems, jewelry, or flowers.\nIncense and perfumes are also often offered at her altars.\n\nFollowers  are  expected  to  foster  and  nurture  love and beauty in everything they do. To\nspread  the  manifestation  of  Ryalas  divinity  across  the  physical  world.  They  are also\nexpected  to  hold  themselves  to  values  of  chastity,  temperance,  and purity. Defiling or\nviolating  something  of  beauty  is  looked  upon  very  harshly by the temples, and is often\ngrounds for punishment within the temples.\n\nThe  typical  follower  of Ryala is a young woman looking to maintain her beauty, courtiers\nlooking  to  stand  out  in  court, and couples in love. However, many Ryalan followers are\nartists,  sculptors,  and  performers  looking  for inspiration or a muse. You might also find\ngardeners or landscapers devoting their gardens to Ryala, or chemists making perfumes and\ncosmetics  to  honor  her.  Diplomats  and ambassadors are also known to follow Ryala, to\nensure love and peace between nations.\n=== Rites ===\n"

The Ryalan Vow is recited during the marriage ceremony,\ninvoking  the  blessings  of  Ryala.  Another  tradition  associated  with  Ryalan vows is the\ncustom  of  "binding  bands," which originated from Castanorian soldiers following Castan\nII  Beastbane.

Many  Old  Rzentur  were  settled  as second class citizens in\nVareynn's  northwestern  territories  where  they  had  to  swear  fealty  to the kingdom and\nconvert to Ynn River Worship. This eventually caused the cultural melting pot which made\nthe modern Rzentur culture.\n\n== Economy ==\nRzenta  accounts  for the majority of the Ynn's fur trapping business.

Of the Wood Elf clans, it was known for the intense kinship its\nmembers shared amongst each other.\n\n== Culture and Customs ==\nOf  all the salla, elves of Salla Cenág were known to value family, however close or distant,\nabove  all  else.  Family  units were characterized by the inclusion of not just grandparents,\nbut  also  cousins, uncles, and aunts. Additionally, crimes committed against clan members\nby  other members met with draconian punishments. An example of this is that punishment\nfor  theft  was  not  only repayment in the form of hard labor but also disownment from the\nsalla,  meaning the offending elf would be clanless - an effective death sentence in the Bone\nGrove.\n\nIndeed,  the  Bone  Grove  proved  to  deeply  shape the Cenága elves. Due to the constant\nexposure to death and bone in the aptly named Bone Grove, the elves of this clan were well\nknown  for a particularly dark gallows humor dealing with death. This casual view of death\nalso  lead  these  elves  to  be  more  open  to  new  ideas  compared  other clans. This was\nreflected   in   a  unique  Cenága  phrase  "''Yfel  Cenág"'',  meaning  roughly  "the  Bone\nStruggle."   Connotatively,   "the   Bone  Struggle"  is  a  philosophy  of  how  life  is  ever\nthreatened  to give way to death. Nothing is above this - no elf, nor no idea. Thus, it is key\nto keep fighting for as long as possible and to do whatever it takes to keep oneself withering\naway to just bone.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Founding ===\nOf  the  Wood  Elven  salla,  Salla  Cenág would be on of the last to find its roots. Its story\nbegan  when  Moon  Elf  scouts  arrived  in  the Bone Grove, some decades after the initial\nelven  arrival.  While  the  Forest Goblin clans had been on long decline on the whole, the\nBone  Grove was one of a few areas where goblin civilization had managed to reverse some\nof  this  decline.  As  a  result,  elven  expansion  into the grove would be more piecemeal.\nWhile  the  goblins would be pushed back eventually, they were not decisively defeated like\nthey  were  in  other groves.

When  the  Drennen  elves  refused  to give up the fugitive Arun,\nconflict erupted between the two clans, known as The Cousins' War.\n\nInitially,  Cenága  elves  were  able  to  find great success against elves of the Thorn Grove.\nThis  success  can  be  traced  to Belarion escalating the war beyond just traditional raiding\nand  instead  organizing a number of elves into an invading warband.

They were however not willing to go as far as to\nactively  support  the  Ashentree Pact in their desire of revenge against humanity, eventually\nleading to their demise by the hands of Blackened Prince and the orcs he led there.\n\n==Culture and Customs==\nThe  shadow  grove is surrounded by the Serpentspine Mountains and is covered by a thick\ncanopy  of  black  leaves  which  makes  it  pitch  black,  thus it allowed the elves complete\nsecrecy  of  any  matter  within.  The  Unseelie  Fey  were known to curse elves if they had\nfound  themselves  unwittingly committing slights against them which taught the elves to be\ncareful of what they said, as they could never know who was listening.\n\n==History==\n\n===Before the Greentide ===\nIn  1435,  the  high  noble  and  powerful mage Selusa Ghúl of Salla Ghúl raided the River\nGrove  for  its  magical  components which started a low intensity war between Salla Ahain\nand  Salla Ghúl. The raid was not sanctioned by the Ghúla leadership which caused Selusa\nto  be  exiled  in  1436  while the conflict still continued between the two groves with raids\nand  counter  raids. As the exiled Selusa left Ghúl, she had stumbled upon the small goblin\ntribe of Verminhusk where she charmed the chieftain.\n\n===The Greentide Invasion ===\nIn 1440, the combined might of the Sallas Fealgarn, Scotha, and Ahain were defeated when\nfighting the Greentide in the River Grove and warned Salla Ghúl about the orcs, asking for\nthe end of the war against Ahain as well as aiding the army. However, Ghúl refused to help\nand threatened to attack their troops if they set foot in their lands.\n\nIn  1441,  when  the  3 Sallas were trapped between Ghúl and the Greentide, they chose to\nflee  through  Ghúl and reached Vyr Trónna, deeming it the safest option even as they were\nharassed by Ghúla ambushes. As the army had escaped, the Greentide soon followed as the\nBlackened Prince had led Troknar Silentblade to the Shadow Grove, where the Ghúla elves\nfought fiercely against the orcs."

 page_events.1303.d: "\nSalla  Myna  was  a Wood Elf clan controlling the Mountain Grove within the Deepwoods.\nThey  were  widely  considered one of the strongest of the Wood Elf Sallas and the cultural\nhub  of  Wood  Elf civilization. Positions that were only further solidified under the rule of\nGalyndor Myna and his daughter Bricena Myna\n\n==Culture and Customs==\nAs  with  every  Wood Elven Salla, the defining cultural characteristics of Myna elves was a\nreflection  of  their  grove.  To  start,  they tended to be more stubborn and unyielding than\nother  clans,  much  like  the  mountain  they  live  on.  This,  however,  was entirely paled\nentirely to the attitude of dwarves.\n\nIn  addition,  due  to  Mountain Grove uniquely being the one place where the land breaks\nfree   from  the  oppressive  darkness  of  the  Deepwoods'  canopies,  the  general  cultural\ndemeanor  the  elves  tended  to  lend  toward  a  greater  levity and rely less on the gallows\nhumor Wood Elves were better known for.\n\nPerhaps the most notable hallmark of Myna elves was their pursuit of the arts. This is most\nevident  in  the  then  capital  of Ciranmyna. As a result of the Myna elves, the city today is\nuniquely  "woven"  into  the mountain itself with each district is uniquely adorned with the\npatterns in vogue at the time. And, throughout the city, mosaics of precious stones, sourced\nfrom  the  nearby  and  only  gem  mine  in  the Deepwoods, lead the city to sparkle during\nsunrise and sunset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

 page_events.1307.d: "\nSandworms  are  a  giant,  leathery  worm  species  native  to  the  Haraf  Desert in western\nAelantir.  They  are  known  as “Saii’ch’oosh” (Sandworm) and “Neiha Ek’elas’ne” (Gift of\nEk’elas) to the native Haraf'ne.\n\nA sandworm’s length can range from 1 to 50 meters. The age of the worm plays a large part\nin  its  size:  adolescent  worms  may be 1-2 meters long, adult worms 3-9 meters long, and\nelder worms, who express relatively rapid, remarkable growth, reaching 10-50 meters long.\nSandworms may potentially live exceptionally long lives; the oldest known sandworm living\n121  years  in  captivity.  Its  skin  color  matches  that  of its sandy habitat, although some\ndisplay  very  slight  color  variations.  When  fully agape, a sandworm’s mouth becomes its\nmost  distinctive  feature,  becoming  nearly  as  wide  as  its  diameter,  and  is  filled with\nhundreds of blade-like teeth that rend apart flesh, plants, and earth alike.\n\n== Diet ==\nSandworms are apex predators, omnivores, scavengers, and opportunistic detritivores. They\npredate  mostly  on  the fauna of the desert such as four-eyed goats, desert lions, hares, and\neven  smaller  sandworms.  They  will  hunt by rapidly approaching from beneath the sands\nand  breaching  the  ground  where  the prey waits, swallowing them whole. Sandworms are\nblind creatures, and therefore must find prey and navigate their surroundings through scent,\nsound, and miniscule seismic changes affected by other living creatures.\n\n== Reproduction ==\nSandworms  are  hermaphrodite,  egg-laying  creatures  and  any  two  worms  may  mate to\nfertilize the other’s eggs. Although sandworms are unisex creatures, a sandworm whose eggs\nare  fertilized  will  lay  and  care for the eggs until hatched, and be referred to as a “mother\nsandworm”,  especially  within  Haraf'ne  society. A mother sandworm will protect its eggs\nviciously  and  attack  anything that comes near, even other sandworms. While guarding its\neggs,  the  mother  sandworm will, uncharacteristically of normal sandworms, lie coiled on\ntop   of   where   their   eggs   are  buried  when  resting,  rather  than  burying  themselves\nunderground."
 page_events.2656.t: "Sandworm 2 / 4"
 page_events.2656.d: "\n\n== History ==\nSandworms  have  been  known  to the Haraf'ne Ruinborn people since the migration from\ntheir  mountain shelters to the deserts and flatlands of Northern Haraf, circa years 30-100.\nThe  sandworms  were  initially  viewed  by the ancient Haraf'ne as evil scavengers feasting\nand  burrowing  in  the  corpse of their dead god Ek’elas (believed to be the literal sands of\nthe  Haraf  Desert).  Hunting  the  worms  for  sustenance, sport, and religious ceremonies\nbecame commonplace with the rise of House Ch’oosh’marah (Worm Slaughter).\n\nBetween  years  855-870,  the  rise of House Leeti’haàt (Desert Watch) and the wealth and\nprestige  resulting  from  the  development  of  sandworm-taming, along with the decline of\nHouse   Ch’oosh’marah,   resulted   in  the  popular  and  religious  opinion  of  sandworms\nimproving  markedly.  Sandworms,  and Precursor relics scattered beneath the desert, were\ngradually  viewed  as the ‘final gifts’ of Ek’elas before his demise. This was canonized in the\nyears   928-934   with   the   rise  of  House  Hateil’ine,  (Singer)  whose  religious  impact\nstandardized many beliefs and practices between all Haraf'ne.\n\nIn  recent  history,  wild  sandworm  sightings  and habitat sizes have decreased rapidly in a\nstudy  conducted  from  1896-1900,  indicating  a  possible  endangerment  of  the species.\nTheories  for  this  include  increasingly  disruptive  relics  expeditions  encroaching on the\nsandworms’   habitat,   or   natural   reasons,   such   as   a  lack  of  food  sources,  forcing\nmass-migration.\n\n== Role in Haraf'ne society ==\nPrior  to the discovery of sandworm-taming, a sandworm’s practical use in ancient Haraf'ne\nsociety  was  accepted  as  and  limited  to  sustenance. After, however, sandworms steadily\ngained  religious  significance  as  one  of  Ek’elas’ primary symbols and tamed sandworms,\nalong  with  their  eggs,  were  some of the most valuable commodities throughout much of\nHaraf'ne history.\n"
 page_events.2657.t: "Sandworm 3 / 4"
 page_events.2657.d: "\nThe taming process begins with a party of Haraf'ne known as “egg-hunters” locating a wild\nsandworm  mother’s  nest  and  waiting  for  it  to hunt for food, leaving its nest unguarded.\nUpon  securing  typically  one  or two of the colossal eggs, they are then cared for either by\ntamed  mother  sandworms  (who  may  also  be  a source for new eggs) or by the Haraf'ne\nthemselves.  When  hatched,  adolescent sandworms are then familiarized with Haraf'ne to\nmollify  its  predatory  tendencies and subjected to lengthy behavioral conditioning in order\nto fulfill roles that are useful to the Haraf'ne.\n\nThe role of a tamed sandworm is dependent on its age.\n\n=== Adolescents ===\nAdolescent  sandworms  are  primarily utilized for discovering Precursor relics lost beneath\nthe  sands  of the Haraf Desert in a discipline known as “worm-watching”. Worm-watching\nis  the practice of observing the subtle differences in a sandworm’s behavior when presented\nwith   new,  underground  stimuli,  establishing  the  specific  sandworm’s  response  to  the\nstimulus  of  Precursor  relics,  and  using  said  response  to  locate  underground stores of\nPrecursor relics, where a marker is placed and excavated by a team of Haraf'ne diggers.\n\n=== Adults ===\nAdult  sandworms  are  primarily  utilized for transportation within the huge expanse of the\nHaraf  Desert,  as  a  sandworm is more efficient than a horse in such an arid environment.\nSandworm riding is not too dissimilar from horse riding in terms of directional navigation.\nTools  known  as  “wormhooks”  are used to painlessly latch onto the sides of a sandworm’s\nthick,  leathery  hide.  When  the  hooks  are pulled, it indicates to the worm that it should\nturn or stop, like a horse’s reins.\n\n=== Elders ===\nElder  sandworms  take  on  less  of  a practical role and instead are either released into the\nHaraf  Desert  to  be retired or, in times of plenty, kept as prestigious “religious icons” that\nare  the  center  of many festivities. In such festivities, an elder sandworm is usually draped\nin  an  equally giant, intricately designed, colorful cloth that takes a village many months to\ncomplete.  In  addition,  the elder sandworm is fed its most favorite foods and showered in\naffection and words of praise."

Its  inhabitants  are  simply  called  Sarda  as  well  and  they  are  the\nsouthernmost culture of Ynnic Ruinborn civilization.\n\n==Geography==\nThe  Ynn  River  divides  Sarda in two as it flows through it north-to-south, until it reaches\nthe Cliffs of Ruin where it forms the waterfall of Venaan's Tears.\n\nTo  the  east  and west are the lightly-populated lands of Veykoda and the Epednan Expanse\nrespectively,  which  were traditionally populated by nomadic or tribal Ruinborn before the\narrival of Cannorian settlers starting in the sixteenth century after Ash.\n\nThe  Sarda region is flat and covered by vast forests and farmlands, the two often coexisting\nthanks to the Sarda's ability with forest farming.\n\nDue  to  the  flatness  of  the  region, the Sarda Ruinborn have little natural defenses except\ntheir  forests. While in ancient times the Sarda had developed a tradition of skilled rangers\nwho  used  these  forests  to  stave  off  invaders,  modern  Sarda  have grown reliant on the\nprotection offered by knights and castles instead.\n\n==Economy==\nSarda  has  been  traditionally  the  wealthiest  of  the  Ynnic  regions, thanks to its warmer\nclimate  and  abundance of farmland. Sarda's farms produce both grain for sustenance, and\nspecialty crops such as berries and vegetables.\n\nAnother  factor  is the Ynn River Worship custom of sending funerary barges down the Ynn\nRiver.  This gave Sarda rulers plenty opportunities to enrich themselves by demanding tolls\nfor the passage of barges arriving from the upstream regions of Dolindha and Rzenta, while\nnot  suffering  as  many  tolls  themselves  due to their region's location near the end of the\nriver.  This  opportunistic  practice  has  earned  the  Sarda  Ruinborn the name of "Bridge\nTrolls" by their detractors."

 page_events.1319.d: "\nThe  Second  Ynnic Civil War or War of the Cousins was a conflict fought from 896 AA to\n898  AA  over  rulership  of  the  Ynnic  Empire.  The  reigning  Emperor, Calrodiy I, was\nchallenged by his cousin Ivranvit for the Imperial throne.\n\n==Prelude==\nWhile the Ynnic Empire had been formed by the Dolindhan conquests led by the Kingdom\nof  Vareynn,  Sarda's  warmer  climate  and  lively culture attracted many of the Dolindhan\nnobility  south,  where they took over the local principalities and married into Sarda ruling\nfamilies.\n\nThe Ynnic Emperor himself, Darastarad I, joined this process in 674 when he inherited the\npalace of Stanyrhrada through his wife princess Valyana and made it the seat of his court.\n\nThis   caused   outrage   among  the  traditional  northern  Dolindhans,  though  they  were\nnonetheless  appeased  with concessions such as increased autonomy. Tensions would come\nto a head two centuries later.\n\n==Belligerents==\nBy  896  AA  the  Ynnic  Empire  had  become  polarized  between  a  Sarda  faction  and a\nDolindhan  faction, who rallied behind the new Emperor Calrodiy I and his cousin Ivranvit\nrespectively:\n\n* Calrodiy I ruled from the Imperial capital of Stanyrhrada, and controlled much of Sarda.\n* Ivranvit's seat of power was in Drevkenuc and he had the support of much of Dolindha.\n\nThe region of Rzenta is not mentioned by historical sources.\n\nThe  war  lasted  from  896  AA  to 898 AA and saw great losses. Most of the fighting took\nplace  in  Dolindha,  however  Sarda wasn't spared: in early 898 AA two Veykodan hordes,\nled  by the chiefs Koda and Dmina respectively, exploited the absence of the Imperial army\nto invade Sarda."

The  keep  of  Arvezl  was  also  founded  as  an\nintermediate  to  fill  the  gap  between  the  two.  The  new  settlements  helped  ward  off\nincursions from the Veykodans of the east.\n\nArverynn  was  made  the  new  Imperial  capital. Its position between Sarda and Dolindha\nallowed   quick  intervention  in  case  either  region  rebelled  again.  Some  theorize  that\nArverynn's vicinity to Dolindha was a compromise with the defeated Dolindhan faction.\n\n==Aftermath==\nCalrodiy's  victory  cemented  the role of Sarda as the premier region of the Ynnic Empire,\nand  established  Sarda  Ruinborn as a military power in their own right, having bested in a\nbloody  conflict  the  more  numerous  and  war-ready  Dolindhans  who were traditionally\nregarded as the true defenders of the Ynn.\n\nThe Second Ynnic Civil War is commnly pinpointed as the start of the decline of the Ynnic\nEmpire.  Others  contest this, as the civil war's victor went down in history as Calrodiy the\nGreat,  founding  the Vyrekynn dynasty which ruled the Empire uninterrupted until its fall,\nand  the  capital  he  built,  Arverynn, experienced a golden age becoming one of Aelantir's\nmost populous cities and a cultural center.\n\nDolindhan subjects didn't remain completely compliant, as the Bostynn Incident fifty years\nlater  showed. Parts of Dolindha would rise up in the Revolt of 1146, and the Third Ynnic\nCivil   War   in   1151   AA  would  see  a  repeat  of  the  events  of  the  second,  with  a\nDolindha-based  claimant  challenging  the  ruling  emperor  in Sarda. This time Dolindha\ncouldn't  be  subdued,  and  the Ynnic Empire would remain a rump state in Sarda until its\nfinal collapse in 1205 AA."

In response, Sedoric and his two surviving brothers, Princes Bellac and Coreg, all\ndeclared  themselves to be King, starting a civil war. Though initially supported by nobody\nbut  his  fellow  mercenaries, having crowned himself a king in front of a barn in the Isle of\nTef  after  having  won  a border skirmish on behalf of a local count, Sedoric’s return home\nwould  be  accompanied  by  several  other  mercenary groups he hired using money he had\nsecretly kept for himself rather than send back to Akasik.\n\nHis  surviving  brothers  had by this point each consolidated themselves in a different city -\nCoreg  in Deshak and Bellac in Khasa - and began warring with each other. Sedoric would\nbegin his campaign by landing in Benirkes, on the west coast of Akasik, traditionally under\nthe  influence  of the Silver Republic of Ekha, a vassal state of the Kingdom of Akasik. The\nEkhani, admiring his connections with Cannor and hoping to forge commercial ties of their\nown,  would  not  only  permit  his  forces to pass through their territory but would secretly\ngrant  him  a  significant  loan,  in  exchange  for  future  repayment  as  well  as mercantile\nprivileges, allowing him to pay his mercenaries immediately rather than rely on promises of\nfuture pay."

Sedoric  would  march  into  Deshak  without  a  fight,\nreuniting  the  Kingdom  of  Akasik  under  his  rule.

They  first found fame as becoming the official bodyguards of Jaher,\nand  later on found infamy as traitors to the dwarven race for infiltrating and allowing Jexis\nto  conquer the hold of Seghdihr and disband the Segbandal. After Jexis' death in 1162 the\nSeg  Band,  in  a  surprise to many, peacefully relinquished control of the hold in return for\namnesty and returned to their mercenary roots.\n\n==History==\nGreater context to the Seg Band can be found in the history of the Segbandal.\n===Founding===\nIn  803  BA,  a  number  of  dwarves from Hehodovar, Seghdihr, and Gor Vazumbrog, had\ngrown  tired of fighting orcs and goblins had heard tales of Hyena-men from the merchants\nof  the  surface,  formed  the  Seg  Band, and began selling their services to Bulwari realms\nunder  threat  of  gnollish  raids.

Many warriors would adorn their armour with the pelt\nof their first slain gnoll.\n\n===Assisting the Castanorians===\nIn  666  BA,  the  world  saw  the  rise of the First Xhazobine. This forced the Seg Band to\nretreat  eastwards,  where  they  turned the Salahad into their base of operations against the\nXhazobine's  forces.  Despite their best efforts, their actions amounted to little in the grand\nscheme, though it is said they were among the first to make for the armies of Castanor, and\noffered  their  services  to Castan II “Beastbane” as mercenaries, beginning the long history\nof the Seg Band as a dwarven mercenary army.\n\n===Arrival of Jaher===\nWith  the  fall  of  Azka-Sur  to  the Jaherian Legions, many dwarves of the Segbandal were\nconcerned  with  Jaher  turning his blade to the gates of Seghdihr. However, in 1015, Jaher\nhimself  stood  before  the gates of Seghdihr and wished to speak with the four Kings of the\nSegbandal.

Under the guise of seeking\nnew  recruits  for  the Band, the Seg Band infiltrated the hold and overran the Gate guards,\nthrowing open the gates of Seghdihr and allowed her armies to conquer the hold in 1139.\n\nHer  plan  was,  for  the  most part, a success. The suddenness of it meant that, by the time\nmany  of  the  defenders  realized  it,  the  Hold was already occupied by Elven legionaries,\nBulwari  auxiliaries,  and  Seg  Band traitors. Using the Seg Band as proxy enforcers to her\nrule,  Jexis  effectively  used  Seghdihr's  influence as the leader of the Segbandal to put the\nrest  of  the alliance under her sway, going as far as to dethrone the sitting king of Seghdihr,\nand replacing him with a puppet, Morgrend az-Segh.\n\n===Sack of Gor Ozumbrog and Death of Jexis===\nTwo  years  after  the  occupation of Seghdihr, King Ombrindal az-Fiobmhor, King of Gor\nOzumbrog,  marched  with  a host to Seghdihr to ask for aid to reconquer Gor Vazumbrog.\nMorgrend  decided to ask Jexis about the plea for aid, however, this only ended up with the\nSeg  Band's  Commander  killing Morgrend as they opposed his desire to help Ombrindal,\nand  blamed  the  Topaz  Dwarf  King for the death.

This caused the Seg Band to\nconvince  the other holds and Jexisian legionaries and magi to journey to Gor Ozumbrog as\npart of a punitive expedition.\n\nWith   King  Ombrindal  occupied  in  the  Tree  of  Stone  fighting  goblins,  the  punitive\nexpedition  laid  siege on Gor Ozumbrog and broke through their gates using the combined\npower  of  the  elven  magi,  laying  waste  to  the  hold  and  pillaging  it. The Sack of Gor\nOzumbrog  was  some  of  the  most  devastating  violence in Dwarven history, with the Seg\nBand  themselves  encouraging  levels of violence and behavior in the soldiers of the rest of\nthe  armies  that  many  would  in  time  regret.

Despite\nthis,   the  religious  inclinations  of  the  population  slowly  begin  the  long  and  gradual\ntransition to modern Ancestor Worship and away from the Dwarven Pantheon."

Remarkably,  in  2781  BA,  a  dwarf named Krummul\nOrcslayer  joined  the  Dauvek  Veker  at 23 years of age, which was unprecedented for any\ndwarf  before  or  after  him,  proving  his  mettle  by slaying an entire nest of ancient Deep\nCrows, returning their feathers and heads as proof.\n\n=== End of the Golden Age===\n\n====Second Fall of Hul-Jorkad ====\nIn  2681 BA, disaster struck in Hul-Jorkad when a rich and powerful orcish warhost which\nhad  pillaged  Orlghelovar,  had  returned  to  take  Hul-Jorkad.  They believed their God,\nDrookani  was  held in the hold and assaulted the hold with an intense ferocity. The sieged\nthe  hold  for  two years which in turn led them to find a way into the lower hold levels due\nto  the neglect of internal reclamation by the Titanium Dwarves. This led to a two-pronged\nattack  as  the orcs fought in a frenzy while searching for their lost god, and sought to break\nhis  chains  with  dwarven  blood.  It  was  only  by  a miracle that the dwarves managed to\nretreat  thanks  to  the  arrival  of  Krummul  Orcslayer  and  his  500 strong warhost of the\nDauvek Veker's finest which helped the last living dwarves to escape Hul-Jorkad.\n\n====Orcish Incursion into Bulwar====\nWith  the conquest of Hul-Jorkad, the orcs could not reach past Bogig Vazumbrog, instead\ndeciding  to  leave  the  Dwarovar in 2673 BA. They were armed with maps and charts left\nbehind  by  the Titanium Dwarves, knowing that Seghdihr had opened up the headwaters of\nthe   Suran.   The  orcs  marched  through  the  Harpy  Hills,  following  the  Serpentspine\neastwards to Seghdihr as the details of their passing were lost to history.\n\n=== Relations with Surface Dwellers==="

The God-King, though technically capable of destroying\nthe  host  on their own, had encountered an issue that plagued many of his contemporaries,\nmanpower.  Whilst they could have used their bound Djinn and wish the host destroyed, it\nwould have opened himself to an attack by his rivals, who had directed the host to his lands\nwith  bribes  and  trinkets.  Consulting his advisors, one stated that he had heard a tale that\nthe  “Stone-carvers”  that  inhabit  the  mountains  and  trade  from  the  “Great  Harbour”\nupstream  of  the  Suran have been rumoured to struggle with nightmares from the bones of\nthe  earth.  Weary  of  wasting power that would risk leaving him open to his rivals, he sent\nhis finest warriors to request their aid in destroying the ones that plague his realm.\n\nThe  response to his call to aid was a legion of 16,000 of the Segbandal’s finest, with 3,000\nwarriors  from  each  hold,  and  1,000  of  the  Dauvek Veker, led by Krummul Orcslayer\nhimself. They met with Mušargil, and though most of the details of the exchange are lost to\nthis day, at least one passage from Krummul Orcslayer’s speech has survived intact.\n''“I  am Krummul, Son of Vlondir. To you, Mušargil, this day, I and these 16,000 souls of\nthe  Segbandal  who follow me swear to not leave this sandblasted realm until every last orc\nis  slain.  Until their filth no longer taints the lands you call your gardens. We swear under\nOath  to  Halanna  and our Ancestors, upon Dagrin and his Beard, upon Hehogrim and his\nmastery  of  every  Craft  known  to Dwarvenkind, and ancestors new and old, that we shall\nfight  alongside  your  soldiers,  clad  as  they  are in bone and copper. We shall teach your\npeople  to  craft  this into a harder metal, one that will not bend nor break as easily against\nthe black metal of the orcs.''\n''This  we  give  to  you  as  penance  for  our  failure  to  contain  them.  In return, we ask\npermission  to cross your realm and do battle together against them. In show of friendship,\nwe  shall  teach  your  people  to  hew  the  stone  with  the  tools they shall make with our\npenance.  In return, we ask yours and ours to break bread and beer together, as equals. For\nonly  as  equals,  can  the  orcs be defeated. Only together, only united, can this menace be\nstopped. I say this to you as Krummul, Son of Vlondir, also known as Orcslayer. This truth\nevery dwarven soul here swears.”''"

The\nhumans  fought alongside the dwarves as equals, and though it was not without struggle, the\ntwo  races  found  victory.  Though the dwarves would return to their mountain homes, the\nancestors of the Surani would find their lives changed within two generations. The Dwarves\nwould  meet  with  wise  men  and  tradesmen  within the walls of Logrod-Tûngr, and teach\nthem  the  secrets  of  forging bronze instead of simply trading for it from Shazstundihr and\nthemselves.  They  would  be  taught to determine what stone was best for building, how to\ncarve  bricks  and  blocks,  and  build constructions from it that stood three stories tall. As\nwell,  a  titanium  and  gold  crown  was granted to the God-King, set with carved pyrite, a\nflawless topaz, and a beautiful golden citrine that radiated light like no other.\n\nThis  was  the  promise  of  the  Dwarves of the Segbandal to the peoples of the Suran, and\nthough  in  time  it  would  be forgotten, though Mušargil's name lost to his people.

This migration continued for roughly 140 years\nand  saw  further  change  in  Segbandalic-Human  relations,  beyond just the Proto-Surani\npeoples, and as far south as Brasan.\n\n==== Rise of Seghdihr and Logrod-Tûngr====\nWith the gradual increase of surface trade between the Dwarves and the Humans, Seghdihr\ntruly  earned  the  name “Southern Gate” in 2000 BA, as the only fortified point of entry to\ntrade  with  the humans. Whilst Verkal Gulan retained a gate to the surface, it was a minor\npoint  in  comparison to the volume of trade leaving Seghdihr. With food supplies entering\nthe  Segbandal  controlled  by  Seghdihr,  the  hold  began  to gain considerable sway in the\npolitics of the alliance.\n"

The local ruling tribal king commissioned the\ndwarves  to  build  a  fortress  on a nearby hill from which to rule. This in time inspire the\nfirst  iteration  of  the  “Mountain Fortress” that most Human Bulwari texts refer to during\nthe earliest days of Azka-Sur’s history.\n\n====Arrival of the Qašnitu====\nThe  arrival  of  the  Qašnitu in 1537 BA and the foundation of the Karqašlu Empire led to\nmuch  chaos in Bulwar. Three decades after the arrival of the Horse Lords, concerns in the\nSegbandal  about these new arrivals resulted in a stripping of the garrison in Logrod-Tûngr,\nand  a  recall  of  all  but a few dozen dwarves as a token garrison as the Qašnitu horselords\nmade their way east along the Suran. When Logrod-Tûngr and its surrounding area, what is\nnow  known as ancient Azka-Sur, was seized by the horselords, pillaging the stonework and\nlooting  the trade depot. The Dwarves of the Segbandal responded to this insult by shutting\ntheir  gates  to  the merchants of Karqašlu until the Empire compensated the damages dealt\nto  Segbandal  property. These damages were however never compensated, leaving the gates\nshut.\n\n====Return to the Surface====\nBy 1390 BA, over a century since the seizure of Logrod-Tûngr, the Karqašlu Empire began\nto  lose grip over the upper Suran. When the Dwarves finally return to Logrod-Tûngr, they\nfind  much  has  changed. Where Logrod-Tûngr once stood was now a human citadel, built\nupon  the  structure and foundations where it once stood. Surrounding it, the small town of\ncraftsmen and apprentices had grown to a proper city. Acknowledging the fact that they had\nabandoned the structure, they requested from the local ruler the right to buy, sell, and trade\ngoods and property within the bounds of the city, which was granted.\n\n===War of the Two Brothers ===\nBeginning  in  873  BA, Seghdihr became embroiled in civil conflict due to a legal error in\nthe  inheritance  will of the late King Drurngir XVI az-Segh and his three sons. While such\nincidents were not uncommon, the scale of which was usually small. In this case, it led to a\n29  year  long  civil  war,  in which King-Claimant Hegomir IV did battle against his older\nlegitimate  brother,  King  Drurnir XIV. It was during this conflict that Hegomir stole away\nthe  Citrine  Gem  from  the  royal  treasury  in  a move to legitimize himself. All this only\nincensed  the  entirety  of  the  hold,  as  Drurnir’s  supporters  chased  Hegomir  out  of  it\nDiscovering  that  the  Citrine  Gem  was  not  in  the  areas  he  occupied,  an army under\nDrurnir’s command marched out to do battle."

Following  the  confirmation of their\ndeaths,  Drurngir’s third son, King Gormmor I ''“The Unexpected”'' az-Segh was crowned,\nand called the whole incident “completely avoidable” had anyone actually taken the time to\nwork things through.\n\n===Rise of the Seg Band ===\nIn  803  BA,  a  number  of  dwarves  from Hehodovar, Seghdihr, and Gor Vazumbrog had\ngrown  tired  of  hunting  orcs  and  goblins,  and  sook  a  different  prey.  Hearing tales of\nHyena-men  from  the  merchants of the surface, the Seg-Gnelh-Vekerbandal or ''Southern\nGnoll Hunter’s Alliance,'' later shortened to Seg Band, began selling its services to Bulwari\nrealms  under  threat  of gnollish raids. Recruits would usually end up being dwarven exiles\nor rarely even human warriors who joined their ranks after being liberated from slavery.\n\n===The Copper and Citrine Wars===\nWith  the  Fall of the Marble Hold of Shazstundihr, the two remaining sources of Dwarven\ninfluences  in  Bulwar  ended  up  being  Seghdihr  representing  the  Segbandal, and Ovdal\nTûngr.  Though the two dominated their respective regions of traditional influence, a series\nof  shadow  trade  conflicts  and  bidding  wars  led  to much rivalry between the two holds\nbeginning  in 270 BA, that will continue all the way to the arrival of Jaher and the blockade\nof Ovdal Tûngr.\n\n==History After Ash ==\n\n===Day of Ashen Skies===\nThe  Day  of Ashen Skies was devastating around Halann, with earthquakes ripping through\nthe  Dwarovar  as  Aelantir came to ruin. Bogig Vazumbrog collapsed and orcish warbands\nthat  are  displaced  due to the aftershocks were pushed into the Vazok Tunad. For the first\ntime  in  history,  Gor  Vazumbrog  itself  was threatened, as the garrison was put onto high\nalert   and   arms  were  mustered  all  across  the  Segbandal.  In  the  East,  towards  Gor\nOzumbrog,  many  defenses  that  were  put in place against goblin assaults suffered serious\ndamage  and  were  in  need  of  repairs. Hehodovar’s elaborate water transportation system\nsuffered  catastrophic  failure  as  the  entire  bottom  layer  of the was flooded and the next\ndecade was spent pumping the lower levels. Verkal Gulan was surprisingly unscathed in the\ninitial  damages,  however  much strain was put on the hold to support the others. Seghdihr\nmeanwhile  used  the  situation  to  centralize even more power, at the expense of the other\nholds,  as  well  as siphoning materials from other holds in order to see to both repairs and\nexpansion of infrastructure."

 page_events.2675.d: "\n\n===Desolation of Gor Vazumbrog===\nIn  year  10,  Gor  Vazumbrog  was  forced  to  engage  in  more active defenses as the area\noutside  its  hold  was under direct threat. Coordination with Hehodovar ensured a strategy\nof  hammer  &  anvil  tactics  that  sufficed  to  hold  off  the menace. However Seghdihr’s\ngrowing control and a stance of “Good enough” prevented the recapture and reconstruction\nof  Bogig  Vazumbrog  due to a stranglehold of supplies. The Segbandal was undeniably no\nlonger  an alliance of equals in 219, as Seghdihr assumed a “First among Equals” position.\nWhilst  the  holds  of  the  Segbandal  still  possessed  autonomy,  all  surface  interactions-\nincluding  trade  transactions,  were  officially  in  the  hands of Seghdihr as the Segbandal’s\nrepresentative.\n\nIn the deepest levels of the hold, many had for days reported the infrequent sound of distant\ntapping,  the  far off sounds of shifting stone that herald something digging. However many\ndismissed  it-  if  it  was  orcs  or  goblins,  the  sounds  would  be far louder and in greater\nnumbers.  Unfortunately  for  Gor Vazumbrog, it was neither. Six days later on the 19th of\nTearfall  472,  disaster  struck  Gor  Vazumbrog  as  a  massive  purple-hued  dragon  burst\nthrough  the  lowest inhabited reaches of the hold, spewing clouds of toxin that drove those\nwho  came  into  contact  with  mad.  As  it  did  so and tried to make its way into the hold\nproper,  out  of  the  tunnel  it  had  dug, it began to break open long sealed vaults, ancient\ntombs  that  had  held  cursed  relics,  artifacts,  and  people  since  before  the  time of the\nPrecursors.  As  it  flailed  about  and  continued  to  fill  the  bottom level with its gaseous\npoison,  the  dragon’s  magic  mixed  with  the  innumerable  artifacts  in the pit beneath it,\ncreating a glowing purple wound of toxic and cursed magic.\n\nEventually, the dragon that would later become known as the Hunter of the Deep, made its\nway   out  of  the  hole  fully.  Unable  to  even  approach  it  without  accruing  devastating\ncasualties,  it  was  at  this  time that General-King Grumni Titanfist ordered for the hold’s\nentire  force  of  golems  be  mobilized  to  attack  the dragon before it destroyed the entire\nfoundation of the hold, and for the rest of the hold to evacuate. This was seen as necessary,\nas  the  dragon’s  miasma  was  spreading  to  the more inhabited sections of the hold by the\nventilation  system,  twisted  by  the  dark  magics produced by the Dragon’s Wound. Many\nprecious  artifacts  and  relics,  secured during the Segbandalic Expeditions were saved, but\nmany more remained behind in the cursed miasma."

 page_events.2676.d: "\n\nBy  the end of the year, almost the entirety of the hold was filled with the dragon’s miasma,\nand  no  dwarf  could  enter and survive. Gor Vazumbrog had fallen- not to orcish warhost,\nprecursor  magic,  or goblin skullduggery, but one of the greatest creatures ever to stalk the\ncaves  of Halann, a Dragon. It would not be until 681 that the miasma would mysteriously\nvanish, and by then the surrounding area would be firmly controlled by Black Orcish tribes\nand beyond the ability of recovery.\n\n===Verkal Gulan and the Mašnsih===\nDespite  opening  up to the wastes of the Salahad Desert, Verkal Gulan found itself with an\nunexpected  trading  partner,  in the tribes of the Mašnsih in 602. Bringing wares along the\nroute  that  would  one day become the Golden Highway, the two groups were both eager to\nbreak   away   from  Seghdihr’s  monopoly  on  surface  access,  and  so  began  a  long  and\nprosperous agreement in regards to trade and exchange.\n\n===Devastation in the Middle Dwarovar===\nSince  Gor Vazumbrog's fall, the orcs had launched repeated attacks on Hehodovar and the\nsurrounding  area  in  an  attempt  to sack the hold. These were largely unsuccessful due to\nhaving to face the armies of the other Segbandal holds as well that blocked the rails outside\nHehodovar.  In  816, the holds of Seghdihr and Verkal Gulan had a quarrel over the usage\nof  the  gold  mined  in  Verkal  Gulan  and  where to best use it. Worried that this quarrel\nwould lead to military action, Verkal Gulan withdrew its forces from Hehodovar. Seghdihr\nfeared  that  Verkal Gulan was preparing to attack them and thus also withdrew their forces\nfrom  Hehodovar.  Now  missing  half its garrison, Hehodovar was unable to repel the next\norcish  onslaught.  The  remaining  Pyrite  and  Topaz Dwarves retreated into the hold and\nbarred the gates.\n\nWith  the  orcs  still  unable to actually besiege Hehodovar itself, they rampaged east along\nthe  now opened rails. The sudden appearance of orcs caught both the Citrine Dwarves and\nGold  Dwarves  unprepared  and  so  they  too  retreated  back into their holds, leaving the\norcish  host  free  to  plunder  the  rails  and  caves  as  they moved further east. The Topaz\nDwarves  of  Gor  Ozumbrog,  with many of their troops stationed in Hehodovar were also\nforced  to retreat into the safety of their hold. Unhindered, the orcs continued east into the\nTree of Stone leaving the Segbandal’s outer territories devastated."

Led by Gorrath the Wrathful, the warband seized Gor\nVazumbrog  from  its  remaining  orcish  garrison  and  proceeded  to  settle  into the hold.\nRather  than using the ancient fortification as a springboard to push further into the Middle\nDwarovar,  however, Gorrath's tribe fortified Gor Vazumbrog and made no sign of moving\nbeyond  it.  Instead,  Gorrath's  band built and developed the hold into a permanent home,\ntheir  warriors  seizing  tunnels  and  hunting the drakes that lurk in the Middle Dwarovar.\nCapturing  several  of  the scaled monsters, the tribe began taming and breeding the drakes,\nwhich  provided  the  orcs  with  food,  scales  for armor, and eventually served as mounts.\nWhen  Gorrath's  long  reign  ended  in  937,  the tribe took the name Skewered Drake for\ntheir clan, which has remained an example of a uniquely stable orcish tribe for hundreds of\nyears.\n\n===The Seg Band-Jaherian Contract===\nWith  the  fall  of  Azka-Sur  to  the Jaherian Legions, many dwarves of the Segbandal were\nconcerned with Jaher turning his blade to the gates of Seghdihr, but what occurred next was\nunexpected  to them. In 1015, Jaher himself stood before the gates of Seghdihr and wished\nto  speak  with  the  four  Kings  of  the Segbandal. A short while later, a meeting occurred\nunder  the  setting  sun,  where  Elf  and  Dwarf  for the first time in millennia sat together,\nbroke  bread,  drank  mead,  and  talked  to  each other as equals. Jaher himself sought the\nservices  of  the  Seg  Band  as  a  personal bodyguard, alongside shipments of weapons and\narmour  from  the  famed  dwarven smiths of the Four Holds to arm his legions for eastern\nconquest.\n\nThe  kings  in  turn  pointed  out  that  the  Phoenix Emperor had harmed the holds greatly\nduring his purge of dwarven influence in his newly forged realm, especially in the expulsion\nof  their people and the overturning of their debts. Despite this, the Kings of the Segbandal\nand  Jaher  spent the next two weeks negotiating compensation for damages, exclusive trade\ncontracts  with  the  Phoenix  Empire, and as well bribing Jaher to continue his blockade of\nOvdal Tûngr in order to secure their own economic dominance in Bulwar."

However, beyond that, she\nsaw  the  wealth  of  the mountains and figured that it could be made to serve her purposes.\nDevising  a  plan,  she  saw  to  it  that  the Seg Band would infiltrate and open the gates of\nSeghdihr  to  her  armies, who had at this time brought order to Azka-Sur. Under the guise\nof  seeking  new  recruits  for  the  Band,  the Seg Band infiltrated the hold and overran the\nGate  guards,  throwing  open  the gates of Seghdihr and allowed her armies to conquer the\nhold in 1139.\n\nHer  plan  was,  for  the  most part, a success. The suddenness of it meant that, by the time\nmany  of  the  defenders  realized  it,  the  Hold was already occupied by Elven legionaries,\nBulwari  auxiliaries,  and  Seg  Band traitors. Using the Seg Band as proxy enforcers to her\nrule,  Jexis  effectively  used  Seghdihr's  influence as the leader of the Segbandal to put the\nrest  of  the alliance under her sway, going as far as to dethrone the sitting king of Seghdihr,\nMorzad   az-Segh   and  replacing  him  with  an  exiled  distant  relative,  Morgrend  “The\nSpineless” az-Segh, to act as her legitimizing figure.\n\n====Ozumbroger Defiance====\nTwo  years  after  the  occupation of Seghdihr, King Ombrindal az-Fiobmhor, King of Gor\nOzumbrog,  marched  with  a  host  to Seghdihr. There, he met with Empress Jexis’ puppet\nking Morgrend. Ombrindal, long grown weary with Seghdihr and its increased stranglehold\nover  the  affairs  of  the  alliance  placed  forth  a demand that, if they are to be subjects of\nJexis,  that  Jexis  assist in the recapture of Gor Vazumbrog from the Skewered Drake Clan\nand  the reclamation of the Dwarovar. The Seg Band, interested in nothing more than their\nown  personal  power  and security, attempted to pressure the King Morgrend into rejecting\nthe demands. Despite their efforts, he refused to agree, leading to them killing him in front\nof Ombrindal, declaring that he had assassinated the King. Fleeing Seghdihr and infuriated\nby this betrayal from the Seg Band, Gor Ozumbrog withdrew from the alliance. Afterwards,\nKing  Ombrindal gathered an expedition and set down the Copper Road, to Ovdal Kanzad.\nHoping  beyond  hope,  he  found  the  hold intact and met with the ruling king, seeking to\ncreate  a  new alliance, and reclaim the Copper Road from the goblins and orcs of the Tree\nof Stone."

The Seg Band set down the\nDwarovrod to Gor Ozumbrog, and when it arrived, demanded that the hold submit itself to\nthe  authority  of the Phoenix Empire and turn over King Ombrindal for punishment. With\nKing  Ombrindal  and  a  significant  portion  of  the  Hold’s  armed forces out clearing the\nCopper  Road,  the  holds  remaining defenders denied the demands as they settled in for a\nlong  siege,  hoping  beyond hope that their king returns before the enemy could do serious\ndamage to the hold.\n\nThe  Seg  Band’s  decision  to  bring  elven  magi  was  the  chief  nail in the coffin for Gor\nOzumbrog.  Whilst  the  hold's  many goblin assailants before may have had magic users, it\npaled   in   comparison  to  the  organized  might  of  elven  magics  enhanced  by  dwarven\nknowledge  of siege craft. The main gate was breached within six months of the siege being\nput  into  place,  and  it  was through elven magic that it occurred. Despite this, the valiant\ndefenders  held  out  hope  for  relief.  As they held out, the Seg Band’s scouts reported the\nreturn  of  King Ombrindal’s army, and with fear of caught between a hold and a hard place\nthey  needed  to  make  a  decision  swiftly.  It  was  determined that the best option was to\nsimply  do  as  much  damage to the hold that they could, and so ordered an all out assault,\nwith full allowance for pillage.\n\nThe Sack of Gor Ozumbrog was some of the most devastating violence in Dwarven history,\nwith the Seg Band themselves encouraging levels of violence and behavior in the soldiers of\nthe  rest of the armies that many would in time regret. The damage however was done, and\nmany  valuables  are  stolen  from  their  owners-  living  and  deceased. After three days of\nbloody  violence,  the  Seg  Band and their forces retreated for Seghdihr, their bloody work\ndone. Afterwards King Ombrindal returned, to see the extent of the damages.\n"

Despite  quick  efforts to repair the\ndamages,  the  Seg  Band’s  actions  had  opened  wounds  that could not be closed in time.\nDespite  this, King Ombrindal led a defense that would last a heroic ten years, not yielding\na  single  inch without much bloodshed from the goblin horde. Heroes were forged, tested,\nand died- never knowing recognition or renown.\n\nThe  Dwarovar’s  Youngest,  an  underdog  by many, finally succumbed to the weight of the\nGoblin  warhost.  The  dwarves  and  their  defenders  were  pushed  into  the  inner  hold,\nseparated  by  barely  intact  defenses  and  one  single  gate.  Regardless, this is when King\nOmbrindal  made  the  agonizing  decision  to  abandon  the  hold,  and  ordered  a general\nevacuation.  Marshaling  the  last  of  his  honour  guard,  he  ordered  the hold’s miners to\nexcavate  exits  from  the inner hold that led beyond the camps of the goblins, which at this\npoint had been moved into the outer regions of the hold in order to pillage and plunder.\n\nWhat   occurred   next  was  a  23  day  long  sacrifice  in  1154,  where  King  Ombrindal\naz-Fiobmhor,  last  King  of  Gor  Ozumbrog, and the 155 surviving dwarves of his retinue\nthrow  opened  the gate of the inner hold, acting as a distraction to ensure the remainder of\nthe  hold  evacuated.  It  is said the last any saw the King, he was atop a literal mountain of\ngoblin  corpses  that  stood nearly thirty feet tall, with broken armour and a snapped sword\ngutting  a  goblin  like  a  fish.  The  refugees  ended up split into two groups, one of which\nmade  their way towards Verkal Gulan, and the remainder to Ovdal Kanzad. Unfortunately,\nthose  that  reached Verkal Gulan did not necessarily find safety, as those that could not pay\ntheir  way  past  the gate's guardians were turned away, and were forced to make their way to\nSeghdihr  instead.  Over  the  next  decade  bands  of refugees made their way towards both\nholds,  though  in  time  the  flow  of  refugees  would become a trickle, and then dropped,\nbefore ceasing altogether by 1167.\n\n==== Fall of Hehodovar===="

Suicides  were  common at first by those who\nengaged  in the violence, and those untainted by the madness began to flee to Verkal Gulan\nor  Seghdihr.  The  madness  that  had  afflicted  Hehodovar  by  this  time  had  reached a\ncrescendo.  Those  sane  enough  to  leave  had  long  done so if able, the remainder forced\ndeeper  and  deeper  into  the  hold as the insanity spread like a plague, seemingly infecting\nwithout  care  or  remorse.  One  day, the hold simply fell silent, and the survivors emerged\ninto a scene of bloodshed and brutality.\n\nEntire  sections  of  the  hold  had  been  demolished, caved in, defaced, or otherwise made\nunlivable.  Those  still traversable were uninhabitable, as a sickening miasma had begun to\nemerge  from  the  one commonality between every scene- that being dead dwarves. Forced\nout  of  the  hold lest they became sick, the survivors fled to Seghdihr and the first hold fell\nsilent after 28,175 years of continuous inhabitation.\n\n===Death of Jexis===\n\n====Dissolution of the Segbandal====\nWith  the  fall  of  Hehodovar,  and  the  influx of refugees, both Topaz and Pyrite tensions\nbetween  the remaining two holds are fierce, and for the Seg Band that remain in Seghdihr,\nnews  arrives at the worst possible moment. The Phoenix Empress Jexis Jaherzuir had been\nkilled,  and  the  rest  of  her  empire  was  in  rebellion  or  outright  collapse as Elizar the\nBlooded  attempted  to  hold it together. Forced with a collapsing alliance, discontent, and\npossible outright rebellion, the Seg Band quickly released the king who had originally been\ndeposed,  Morzad  az-Segh,  in  exchange  for  promises  of amnesty, compensation, and an\neternal vow to bear no arms in the halls of Seghdihr.\n\nKing  Morzad,  for  all  his  hatred  and rage at what the Seg Band had done, accepted their\noffer. He understood that punishing them would not undo the damages that had been done,\nand  slowly  set  to  work  on  rehousing the refugees. Seghdihr closed its gates to the fallen\nDwarovar  and  instead  became  increasingly  invested  in  the  goings-on  of  their  human\nneighbours  down the Suran. Verkal Gulan, in the meanwhile began to do the same, but no\nlonger  did the gates of the Citadel of Gold open to the Dwarovar, and rarely to the Hero's\nVale. The only exception being to trade with the occasional Mašnsih caravan seeking water\nand  gold  in  exchange  for  Raheni  or  Bulwari wares. This marked the dissolution of the\nSegbandal in 1162, with three holds fallen, and the two remaining, separated."

No longer did he care for ruling, only for increasing his wealth. The Goldlords\nof Verkal Gulan would not allow the hold to fall to the greed of their King and thus ousted\nThorar. Exiled from his home, Thorar turned to his people's long time friends the Masnsih\nfor  shelter,  leading  to  the  Goldlords  setting  up  a  republic  to  rule  the hold amongst\nthemselves in 1201.\n\nHowever,  a  century after the creation of the republic in 1316, the Goldlords had fallen to\nthe  same  curse  as  their  last  king.

The main goal of the expeditions were to reclaim Hul-Jorkad and beyond\nfrom orcish control and to strengthen their defenses past Gor Vazumbrog.\n\n==First Segbandalic Expedition==\nIn  5762  BA,  the  first  Segbandalic  Expedition  was  launched  with  the  goal to reclaim\nHul-Jorkad   and  the  Jorkad  Junction,  in  an  effort  to  link  up  with  the  still  stalwart\nSerpentreach.   The   expedition  was  delayed  due  to  many  issues,  primarily  with  food\nrationing and the threat of the Jade Empire to the East with their attempts to break through\nthe  defenses  of  Gor  Ozumbrog. Any travel and news to the Serpentreach had to be made\noverland  through  Genie  territory  which  was  risky,  due  to the nature of Genie politics.\nDespite  this,  Seghdihr  began trading with the Genie Sultanates to alleviate food shortages\nthat began with the loss of the Serpent's Vale.\n\nIn  5695  BA,  the  expedition  had  reached  Hul-Jorkad,  engaging  with the orcish hordes\nsquatting in the first level. But as progress was made to the west, the Jade Empire put more\npressure  against  the  Topaz  Dwarves  of  Gor  Ozumbrog,  forcing them to fortify rapidly\nagainst  them,  in an event known as the Great Restructuring in Ozumbroger history, where\ntheir  fortress  began  to  truly  become equal to its sister hold to the west. From 5650 BA,\norcish  warbands  started  moving  south  to  Hul-Jorkad, causing a tenuous back-and-forth\nover  the  Dwarovrod  leading  to  Hul-Jorkad  for over 150 years, with forces occasionally\ntrapped  in  the  hold  only  to  either  break  out  or  be  relieved  by forces sent from Gor\nVazumbrog.\n\nBy  5488  BA,  with  the  majority  of  the  holds in the West Dwarovar destroyed or under\nunrelievable  siege, the orcs finally made their way towards the Serpentreach in large forces,\nforcing  the Segbandalic Expedition to fail in securing Hul-Jorkad and the Jorkad Junction.\nHowever,  many  Jorkadi  artifacts  were  salvaged  from  the hold and vital knowledge was\nsaved  on  the  construction and maintenance of sanitation systems and piping, sending it to\nSeghdihr  for  safekeeping.  In  5400  BA, the orcs managed to slowly push the Segbandalic\nforces   towards   the   Vazok   Tunad   but  had  reached  Bogig  Vazumbrog,  a  seemingly\nimpenetrable  fortress  which held the orcs back for the next 780 years with much back and\nforth between the Titanium Dwarves and orcs."

Reaching Hul-Jorkad, the Expedition secured the first layer of the\nhold within the year, and began making inroads on the second layer. However, securing the\nJorkad  Junction  was  not  as  simple  a  task.  Orcish  warbands  moving  to and from the\nSerpentreach  and  the  North were constant threats, and often forced the dwarves to retreat\nback   eastward   towards   the  hold,  lest  they  become  crushed  between  two  migrating\nwarbands.\n\nThe  General-King  Thorgrim  Az-Bogig "The Reclaimer" of Gor Vazumbrog declared the\nSecond  Segbandalic  Expedition  a  success  in  4467  BA. Despite not securing the Jorkad\nJunction,  Hul-Jorkad had been reclaimed. The hold was under the military administration\nof  Gor  Vazumbrog and with a dire need for repair, efforts were made to restore the hold’s\ndefenses  before  a  warband  could  attempt  to  retake  the  hold.  Later,  the  Segbandalic\nReclamation made Hul-Jorkad a military colony, with sparse civilian settlement as much of\nthe hold lay in ruins, with resources constantly reallocated elsewhere and towards the active\nfrontlines  or  shoring  up  perceived  faults in the hold’s exterior defenses and the currently\ninhabited section’s defenses.\n==Third Segbandalic Expedition==\nThe  Third  Segbandalic  Expedition  was declared in 3720 BA, with the intention to occur\nafter  fifty  years.  Despite  this,  issues gathering manpower and supplies for the expedition\ncaused  delays  forcing  the  expedition  to  venture  out 18 years after it was supposed to in\n3652  BA.  It  was  launched  from  Hul-Jorkad  with the objective to march up the Jorkad\nJunction  to  Verkal  Kozenad,  marking  it  the  first  time  in  2000 year that dwarven feet\nmarched  in  the Northwestern Dwarovar. Despite this, the expedition met fierce pushback\nin  efforts  to reclaim the hold, and in the next 60 years the expedition saw a back and forth\nwhere the dwarves controlled only a sixth of the first layer of the hold. With the fall of Gor\nBûrad, many orcs found their way back north and found themselves behind the expedition's\ntroops  which  forced them to divert resources into simply keeping supply route open in the\nsouth."

With terrace farming and\nirrigation  from  the  mountain  rivers, they made the region very productive despite its soil\nnot being particularly rich.

Some   theorize   that   they   originate   from   the   Primeval\nSerpentdepths,  and  spread  with  Halanna's  Breath  over  time, to finally cover the entire\nSerpentspine Mountain cave networks.

Goblins, Orcs and\nKobolds  use Glowmoss as a natural light source, and it is also prized for its ability to filter\nand  purify  the  air  in  underground dwellings. It is also edible, although with a foul taste,\nand used as a “last resort” food for the poor, outcasts, and prisoners.\n\n\n\n===Serpentvine===\nA  long, flexible vine that grows along the walls and ceilings of underground tunnels.

It has a fresh, slightly\nbitter flavor and a chewy texture.\n\n\n\n===Crystal Rokon===\nA  type  of  rice-like  plant  that  grows  in  the  deep, mineral-rich soil of the Serpentspine\nmountains.  It  has  a translucent, crystal-like appearance and emits a soft, white light. Can\nbe  boiled  as is which produces a hard crystal-like kernel, or ground into a fine powder for\nuse  as  starch,  flour, or in brewing.

Throughout  the  millennia  it  has  been  domesticated  into various different\nspecies  with their own uses. Serpentgrass is a staple crop in underground agriculture and is\nused  to  make flour for bread, cereals, and for the brewing of alcohol. It has a slightly dry,\ncomplex nutty flavor."

When grown in plantations,\nonly  those  varieties  that  allow  for  the  sawing  of  planks  are  selected.  It  also has the\nsometimes  annoying  tendency of simply staying alive when sawn off its roots, meaning that\nplanks  have  to  be  kept  in  almost  airtight  rooms  to  kill them, as the planks may keep\ngrowing as they are still exposed to Halanna’s Breath."

Their teeth, originally adapted to\nchewing  plant  fibers,  have  become  sharper  and  more robust to break down a variety of\nfoods.\n\nAdditionally,  their  feet  have  grown  larger  and  tougher, aiding in their navigation of the\nrocky  and  sometimes slippery terrain. And, similar to other creatures of the deep, Bnunin\nhave  developed  a  slower  metabolism  to  survive  in  an  environment where food can be\nscarce.\n"

Their\nbirdlike  beak  has  been  replaced  by a pair of powerful, scissor-like pincers, similar to an\ninsect's  mandibles.  Clusters of luminescent red eyes grant the Deep Crow superior vision\nin  the  almost  total  darkness  found  in  the  deepest  pits of the Serpentspine Mountains.\nContrary  to  conventional  avian  physiology,  Deep  Crows  possess  feet  with four claws,\nensuring a secure grip on the rocky and irregular surfaces of the cavern walls.\n\nAmong  these  already  strange  creatures,  certain  individuals known as the “Ancient Deep\nCrows”  stand  out.  They  are  larger,  more  formidable,  and much rarer. The prevailing\nhypothesis  is  that  these  Ancient  Deep  Crows  are  Deep Crows that have survived for a\nconsiderable  time,  thus  reaching  remarkable sizes. However, some scholars propose that\nthese Ancient Deep Crows could represent a distinct but closely related species, given their\nsubstantial  size  difference  and the seemingly commanding influence they exert over lesser\nDeep Crows. Although this hypothesis is intriguing, it warrants more extensive research.\n\nDeep   Crows  are  loners,  typically  inhabiting  the  isolated  depths  of  the  Serpentspine\nMountains.  They  primarily  feed on small to medium-sized creatures that they can swiftly\ncapture  with  their  pincers.  The  fusion of avian nimbleness and insectoid strength makes\nDeep Crows formidable predators within their niche."

Hold Hogs are\nquite different from their surface-dwelling counterparts. They are stocky and robust, with a\ncoarse,  bristly  coat  often  ranging  in  color  from  deep  browns  to  greys,  making them\nwell-suited to the harsh, underground environment of the Dwarovar.\n\nUnlike  surface  pigs,  Hold  Hogs have developed a unique set of adaptations to survive in\nthe  underground.  Their eyes, for instance, are much smaller, reflecting a reduced reliance\non  vision  in  a light-deprived environment. In contrast, their sense of smell and hearing is\nexceptionally  acute,  allowing them to navigate the complex tunnel systems and locate food\nsources in the dark.\n\nTheir  natural robustness and adaptability meant that they were able to survive, even thrive,\nin  the  absence  of  their  dwarven  keepers.

Some of these changes include variations in\nsize,  coloration,  and  temperament  and the development of more robust natural defenses,\nsuch  as thicker hides or more powerful hooves. Some have retained characteristics of their\ndomesticated   ancestors,   while   others   have  evolved  into  more  aggressive  or  elusive\ncreatures. Often coinciding with the presence of Halanna’s Breath\n\nThe  Rothé  are herbivorous creatures that primarily feed on a variety of plant life found in\nthe  subterranean  environments  of  the  Serpentspine  Mountains.  Their  diet  consists of\nlichen,  mosses,  fungi,  and  even  the  unique  Serpentbloom  plants  that are native to the\nregion.  Rothé  have developed a specialized digestive system that allows them to efficiently\nbreak  down  and  extract  nutrients  from  these  plants,  which are often difficult for other\nanimals to process.\n\nWithin  the  Serpentspine  Mountains, rothé are most commonly found in the larger, more\nexpansive  caverns  and  tunnel  systems  that can support their grazing habits. They tend to\nthrive  in areas with abundant plant life and a relatively stable environment, which provides\nthem with ample food sources and suitable living conditions.\n\nSome  specific locations within the Serpentspine Mountains where rothé populations might\nbe  more  concentrated include the fertile caverns near Halanna's Breath gas vents, as these\nvents  create  a  temperate  climate and support the growth of lush vegetation.

They consume organisms that many other species\nwould  deem  inedible,  such  as  Shriekers  and  violet  fungi, which are prolific within the\nmountain  range.  Shriekers,  a  type  of  fungi  capable  of  emitting loud sounds, and their\nsymbiotic  partners,  the  violet  fungi,  use necrotic poison to kill their prey. By feeding on\nthese  organisms,  the  Purple Worms control their populations, preventing overgrowth that\ncould disrupt the intricate balance of the cave's ecosystem.\n\nIn  addition to shaping the physical landscape, the extensive tunnel networks created by the\nPurple  Worms  serve  as homes and pathways for the Grue, scavenger creatures that utilize\nthese  burrows  to  their  advantage.  This  relationship  demonstrates a form of commensal\nsymbiosis,  in  which the Grue benefit from the Purple Worms' activities without providing\nany substantial advantage in return.\n\nWithin  the  archives  of  Dwarven  lore, there is a fascinating but controversial theory that\nsuggests the ancient Dwarves may have harnessed the power of these gargantuan creatures in\nthe  construction of their extensive railway systems. Despite the fantastical narrative and the\nimplied  technological  prowess,  this theory lacks definitive archaeological evidence. Most\nscholars,  including  renowned  biologists,  consider  it  improbable  due  to  the enormous\nchallenges  associated  with controlling such large creatures.

However, most of the golems we see today are of\nthe  guardian  variety.  They  were  created to protect key areas of Dwarven Holds - vaults,\narmories, thrones - any place of significant value.\n\nNow,  many  millennia  after  the fall of their creators, these golems still dutifully carry out\ntheir  assigned  tasks. They continue to guard their designated posts, seemingly oblivious to\nthe  passage of time and the changes in their surroundings. They are not aimless, but rather\nbound by their original orders, often guarding something.\n\nWhether  that  something  still  exists or holds any value is another question altogether. It's\nquite possible that some of these golems stand guard over empty vaults, their treasures long\nsince  looted.  However,  others  may still protect hidden riches or ancient secrets that have\nyet to be discovered.\n\nFrom  a  biological  and  ecological  perspective,  these  golems pose a unique conundrum.\nThey  are  not  living,  yet  they  interact  with the ecosystem in a manner similar to a large\npredator.   While   they   do   not  eat  or  reproduce,  their  movements  and  actions  can\nsignificantly  impact  the local flora and fauna. For instance, their presence in certain areas\ncan  deter  predators  or  even  potentially  prey, thus affecting population dynamics. Given\ntheir  age  and  the materials from which they are made, they can also serve as a habitat for\nvarious mosses, fungi, and small creatures.\n\nHowever,  their  primary  influence  on  the  ecosystem  is  through  their interactions with\nsentient  beings  - dwarves, goblins, orcs, and the like. The areas they guard become closed\nand gated for most creatures, which can shape migration patterns, settlement locations, and\nresource-gathering activities.\n"

Without  natural predators or a lifespan, their influence could\npotentially last as long as they remain functional.\n\n=== Living Crystal ===\nThe  living  crystals  represent  an  unusual  occurrence in the Serpentspine. These entities,\nreminiscent  of  resplendent  gems,  are  renowned  for  their  intrinsic  pulsation, akin to a\nheartbeat  or  breathing lung. However, this is not a mere optical illusion - it's theorized to\nact  as  a  form  of  respiration, whereby the crystals draw nutrients from their surroundings\nand expel waste.\n\nThere's  an ongoing debate concerning the capacity of these living crystals to "infect" other\norganisms  and  transform  them  into  crystalline  lifeforms.  There  have been accounts of\ncreatures  with crystalline growths that seem to proliferate over time. The ambiguity lies in\ndetermining  whether  these  growths stem from an infectious process or result merely from\nprolonged exposure to the crystal's environment.\n\nAmong  the  biological  community,  a  prevailing  theory  suggests  the  crystals' 'infective'\nprocess  could  constitute a form of reproduction or propagation. This theory proposes that\ncrystals  may  implant  shards  or  spores  into organisms that come into contact with them.\nThese fragments could then mature and evolve into new crystals over time.\n\nRegarding  the  crystals' ability to adopt mobile forms, the current hypothesis leans towards\nmimicry or adaptation. In a world where mobility often translates into survival, the crystals\nmay  have  developed  this  capability  to  work  and  interact  with their environment. This\nadaptive   strategy   might   also   account   for  their  apparent  aggression  -  in  the  harsh\nenvironment  of  the Serpentspine, competition for resources is unavoidable among various\nlifeforms.\n\nAlternatively,   it's   proposed  that  the  perceived  'aggression'  might  not  fit  our  typical\nunderstanding  of  animal  behavior.  Rather  than  intentional  harm, the crystals might be\ndemonstrating  purely instinctive or reflexive responses, similar to a plant orienting towards\nsunlight   or   a  single-celled  organism  moving  towards  nutrients.  Hence,  the  crystals'\nbehaviors  could  be  interpreted  as  simple  reactions  to environmental stimuli, devoid of\nmalicious intent or conscious thought."

These Echoes often appear as spectral\nfigures  or  shadows,  repeating  actions  they  performed  in  life or at the moment of their\ndeaths.\n\nSome  Echoes  seem  entirely  unaware of their surroundings or any observers, while others\nseem  to  respond  to stimuli in a limited way. There are accounts of Echoes reacting to the\npresence   of   their  descendants,  familiar  songs,  or  the  sounds  of  traditional  dwarven\ncraftwork.\n\nFrom  a scientific perspective, the Echoes are quite puzzling. Some scholars have suggested\nthat  they  are  magical  in  nature,  while  others propose that they are somehow tied to the\nunique  geological  properties  of the Serpentspine Mountains. There are even theories that\nHalanna's  Breath  may  play  a  role  in  their  manifestation.  The truth, however, remains\nelusive."

Oozes are typically\ncharacterized  by  their  lack of defined shape, adaptive morphology, and ability to flow and\ndeform.\n\n=== Common Ooze ===\nOozes,  also  referred  to  as  slimes,  jellies,  or  puddles,  are  enigmatic  entities typically\ndiscovered  in  deep  caverns  and  dwarven  ruins,  frequently  hidden  in  shadowy,  moist\nrecesses  or  tight  fissures.  Although their precise nature remains a mystery, the prevailing\nbelief   is   that   they   are   massive   conglomerations  of  bacterial  colonies  cooperating\nsymbiotically.\n\nThese  assemblages  create  a  gelatinous,  shapeless  mass, which can differ in dimensions,\nhue,  and even consistency. Oozes are recognized for consuming organic matter, breaking it\ndown  into  simpler compounds that subsequently nourish the bacterial colonies. They feed\nopportunistically,   ingesting   anything   they   encounter,  including  plants,  animals,  and\ndecaying substances.\n\nVarious  Ooze  species exhibit distinct characteristics and behaviors, such as the capacity to\nsecrete  caustic  enzymes,  resist  specific  types  of damage, or adapt to their surroundings.\nCertain ooze species are also bioluminescent, lending them a ghostly, unearthly appearance\nwithin the darkness of the Serpentspine they occupy.\n\nWhile  oozes  are commonly considered mindless beings, recent research has proposed that\nthey  might harbor a rudimentary form of intelligence or collective consciousness, enabling\nthe   bacterial   colonies   to  exchange  information  and  synchronize  their  actions.  This\nhypothesis  continues to be a topic of contention among scholars, and more comprehensive\ninvestigations are necessary to grasp the enigmatic nature of these organisms fully."

 page_events.2703.d: "\n\n=== Healing Slime ===\nFew  accounts  have emerged of an unusual variety of ooze, known as the "Healing Slime,"\nwhich boasts extraordinary restorative properties. This distinct ooze is believed to excrete a\nsubstance that amplifies the innate healing processes of living beings upon contact.\n\nWhen   an   individual  or  creature  is  immersed  in  this  slime,  the  excreted  substance\npenetrates  the body, promoting rapid cellular regeneration and recovery. This can lead to a\nsignificant  enhancement in overall health and vigor, as well as the capacity to heal injuries,\nrepair fractured bones, and even recover from specific illnesses at an accelerated pace.\n\nIt  is  crucial to acknowledge that the Healing Slime is exceedingly rare and remains poorly\nunderstood.  Some  investigators hypothesize that the bacteria within this ooze may generate\na  unique  blend of enzymes, proteins, and other bioactive compounds that act in concert to\nencourage  the  healing  process.  Alternatively, others postulate that the ooze could contain\nan   uncommon   type   of   symbiotic   microbe  that  bolsters  the  host's  natural  healing\ncapabilities when introduced into their system.\n\n=== Gelatinous Cube ===\nThe  origin  of  the  gelatinous  cube  remains  a  topic  of  intrigue and speculation among\nacademics  and  researchers.  Some argue that these oozes were created by ancient dwarven\nsorcerers  to  maintain  the  cleanliness of their railways and dungeons, while others dismiss\nthis idea as nothing more than dwarven folklore.\n\nThe  true  origins  of  the gelatinous cube continue to be shrouded in mystery; however, the\ncreature's  unique cubic form can be attributed to environmental adaptations. These beings\nare  commonly  found within extensive tunnel systems and dungeons, characterized by tight\npassageways  and  abrupt corners. Their cube-like configuration allows for easier navigation\nin  these  restricted  spaces,  effectively  "scraping"  the  walls, floors, and ceilings while in\nmotion.  This  form  enables them to ingest various types of debris, encompassing deceased\norganisms, plant matter, and even non-organic materials such as metal or stone."
 page_events.2704.t: "Serpentspine Fauna 18 / 23"
 page_events.2704.d: "\n\nAs  the  gelatinous  cube traverses these tunnels, it leaves a relatively clean path in its wake,\npossibly  contributing  to  the  misconception  that it was intentionally crafted for this role.\nThe  reality  may  be  more  mundane:  the  gelatinous cube's structure is a consequence of\nnatural adaptation to its habitat, rather than a deliberate creation through ancient wizardry.\n\n== Insectoids ==\n\n=== Veladklufar ===\nThe  Veladklufar  is  a  unique  subspecies  of the common roach that has evolved to thrive\nwithin the challenging depths of the Serpentspine Mountains. Its most notable feature is its\niridescent   scales,   which   serve  dual  purposes:  camouflage  and  communication.  The\nrefractive  qualities of these scales scatter light in the dim environment of the Serpentspine,\neffectively  rendering  the  roach  virtually  invisible  to the naked eye. This effect has often\nbeen  likened  by  Dwarven  explorers to the near-transparency observed in some species of\nfish found in sunlit aquatic environments.\n\nSimultaneously,   these   scales   also  function  as  a  form  of  communication  among  the\nVeladklufar.  By  reflecting  specific  patterns  of  light  that  are  perceptible  only  to their\nspecies,  these  roaches  convey  messages  to  one  another. Although the exact mechanism\nbehind this is not fully understood, it's theorized that subtle movements can manipulate the\nreflected light to express distinct messages.\n\nThe   Veladklufar's   sizable,   scissor-like  jaws  are  a  sight  to  behold  and  a  source  of\nconsiderable concern. They have evolved to cut through stone and metal with relative ease,\na  trait believed to be an adaptation to their diet comprised of resilient, fibrous Serpentvine\nand Cave Fungi abundant in the Serpentspine's deeper parts.\n\nSimilar  to  the  adult  roaches,  the  eggs  of  the  Veladklufar  are cloaked in an iridescent\nmaterial,   providing   them  with  an  effective  camouflage  against  predators.  The  hard,\ngleaming  exterior of these eggs also serves as a protective layer against the harsh conditions\ninherent to the deep mountains."

 page_events.2705.d: "\n\nAlthough  its formidable jaws and near-invisibility might suggest otherwise, the Veladklufar\nis generally not aggressive unless provoked or defended its nest. However, if threatened, its\nunique adaptations make it a significant adversary\n\n=== Lumimoth ===\nA  Lumimoth  is  an  insect,  resembling  a  moth but much larger (about 3-5cm and about\n10-15cm  wingspan).  Its  body  is  covered  in  iridescent  scales  that emit a soft glow. Its\nwings,  resembling  delicate,  translucent  membranes,  are  used both for navigation and to\ncreate  mesmerizing  displays  of  light.  The  creature's  eyes  are  large  and  multifaceted,\nallowing it to see in low-light conditions.\n\nSpecialized  glands  throughout  its  body  produce  a  bioluminescent substance, similar to\nfireflies.  These  glands  can  produce  different  colors and intensities of light, allowing the\nLumimoth to communicate, attract prey, and defend itself.\n\nThe  Lumimoth  serves  as  a vital part of the cave ecosystem. Its bioluminescence provides\nillumination,  casting  an  otherworldly glow throughout the caverns. The creature feeds on\nsmall insects and invertebrates. They live in large swarms and are one of the most common\ninsects in the Serpentspine.\n\n=== Giant Spiders ===\n\n==== Ironweave Skitterers ====\nSpiders  with  incredibly  strong webs that are often found in the Hul-Jorkad Sewers. Their\nsilk was an incredible nuisance to the dwarves as it blocked machinery and sewer pathways,\nneeding  multiple  hours  to  cut  through  even with steel. Their relatively small size made\nthem  hard  to find in the depths, with them not living in large groups. They mostly hunted\nsmall  prey  and  feared  dwarves  and  goblins,  leaving  the webs for self defense to escape\nthem."

 page_events.2706.d: "\n\n== Goblinoids ==\n\n=== Deep Goblins ===\nDeep  Goblins  are  a type of goblinoid creature that dwells in the Serpentspine Mountains\nand  are believed to have originated from the primeval depths of the earth. They are known\nfor  their  sickly appearance, with pale skin and skinny frames, and speak a language that is\nunknown  to  most  other  creatures.  Although  few  have actually been captured, and even\nfewer  willing  to  communicate,  very little is currently known about their culture or where\nthey  hail  from.  The one constant however is their fear of “those below” and it is believed\nthey might be the refugees of some terrible catastrophe.\n\n=== Bugbears ===\nBugbears  are  a  species  of  goblinoid,  known  for their brute strength, towering size, and\nferocious  nature.  They  are  typically  larger  and  more  muscular  than  their  goblin and\nhobgoblin  kin.  Bugbears  are  covered  in thick fur, which helps them withstand the often\ncold  temperatures  of the Serpentspine Mountains. They possess a keen sense of smell and\nhearing, making them formidable hunters in the subterranean environment.\n\nBugbears,  hobgoblins,  and  goblins  all  belong  to  the  goblinoid  family. However, their\nsocietal  structures, behaviors, and interactions vary significantly. Despite these differences,\nthey  all share a common language, Goblin, enabling them to communicate and coordinate\nwhen necessary.\n\nBugbears  are  generally  viewed  as  the  more  primal  and chaotic of the goblinoids, often\npreferring  to  live  in smaller, familial clans as opposed to the large, structured societies of\nthe hobgoblins. They are known for their unpredictable nature and often act as mercenaries\nor hired muscle for the other goblinoid races.\n\nThe  Command,  known  for  its  rigid  hierarchy  and  disciplined military structure, often\nviews  bugbears  as  a  necessary  evil.  They  regard  the  bugbears' strength and ferocity as\nvaluable  assets in times of war, but their lack of discipline and unpredictable nature can be\na  source  of frustration. In times of peace, bugbears can be seen as a potential threat to the\nhobgoblins'  orderly  society,  but  their  strength  and  intimidation factor can be useful for\nmaintaining control over the more rebellious elements of the goblinoid population."

 page_events.2707.d: "\n\nCave  goblins,  the  smallest  and  most common of the goblinoids, often find themselves at\nthe  bottom  of  the goblinoid pecking order. They view the bugbears with a mixture of fear\nand  respect.  While  bugbears  can  be  a  threat, they can also offer protection from other\ndangers of the Serpentspine Mountains.\n\n=== Norkers ===\nThese  creatures  are  native  to  the  Serpentspine Mountains and are borderline feral, with\nlimited intelligence but still able to communicate. They tend to mainly inhabit the volcanic\nregions  around  Gor  Bûrad  but  can  be  found in small enclaves around magma and lava\nsprings within the entire Serpentspine. Norkers have distinctive thick and bony exoskeleton\nskin  that  is  hairless  and  varies  in color from dark grey to reddish brown. It resembles a\ncraggy  rock, and can often be mistaken as such. They prefer to wear loincloths, if anything\nat all, and various adornments and trophies, with a particular preference for red or blue.\n\nNorkers  are  known  to  be  quite  cruel,  lazy,  and vicious, even by the standards of other\ngoblinoids.  They  tend  to  live in disorganized tribal societies and are smaller than typical\ngoblin tribes. They also tend to avoid building and hunting, preferring to steal or raid other\nhumanoids.  Different  tribes  rarely  meet,  but  when  they  do,  it  often results in bloody\nconflict.  This  is  theorized  to be the reason why no known large-scale Norker civilization\nhas ever been encountered.\n\nRegarding  combat,  Norkers  tend  to  use crudely made weapons and favor swarm tactics.\nDue  to  their  thick  skin,  they  do  not  wear  armor  but may be outfitted in scale mail if\ncommanded  by powerful hobgoblins or orcs. Norkers are omnivorous and can be found in\nareas  with a temperate or warm climate. They often live in caves or old dwarven ruins that\nare  unsanitary  and emit a foul odor. Regarding language, Norkers typically speak in a low\nand  gravelly  tone.  They  also have a unique belief system, where they believe that life is a\ncruel  test  by  their  gods, and all other creatures are to be considered enemies testing their\nresolve."

 page_events.2708.d: "\n\n== Aquatics, Fish and Crustaceans ==\n\n=== Cave Crab ===\nCave  crabs  share  a great many characteristics with their overworld counterparts, but with\nseveral defining features. They tend to be far larger in build, with some being reportedly as\nlarge  as  a  small  cottage,  and  are  rarely found in groups larger than two or three. Their\nclaws  have become enlarged over time to the point they are able to crush large segments of\nrock  between  their  pincers.  In  order  to  better  see  in  the dark, they have developed a\nsymbiotic  relationship  with  a  bioluminescent fungus. This fungus grows and lives on the\ncrabs'  backs,  providing  some  light for them to see with, and in exchange, the crabs move\nfrequently  throughout  the  caves  providing  ample  food  and  distribution for the fungus'\nspores.\n\nThese  crabs  are  typically  found  in  larger flooded caverns and underground lakes, where\nthey  feed  off  plants  that  grow along the bottom of the caves. They are a docile race, and\nwill normally retreat into the watery depths when approached. However, when provoked or\nthreatened  these  creatures  are  a  great  threat,  as  their  large  size,  hardened  shells and\npowerful claws can easily sweep aside any adventurer unfortunate enough to draw their ire.\n\nIt has been theorized that these creatures could be tamed and trained for use as pack mules,\nbut  their  large size would likely require an unsustainable and unaffordable amount of food\nduring prolonged work.\n\n=== Logrhundr ===\nThe  Logrhundr,  encountered  deep  within the Serpentspine Mountains during an ill-fated\nexpedition,  is  a unique creature that has captivated Dwarven scholars and explorers alike.\nIt  was  first  described  as  a “fish with legs” by early explorers. The Logrhundr possesses a\nstriking  pink  coloration  and  a  formidable size that dwarfs many of the mountain's other\ninhabitants."

The\nbirthplace  of  dwarves,  goblins,  hobgoblins,  and orcs, the Dwarovar has had a significant\nhand in development of Halcann.\n\n==Etymology==\nOriginating  from  the  Cannorian  creation  myth,  the name Serpentspine comes from the\ndeath  of  Malliath,  the  first  dragon.  After waging war on the gods, Malliath was slain by\nhaving  one  of  his  two  heads  cut  off  and  plummeting  to  the ground. His body would\nbecome  the  Serpentspine,  whereas  his heads would be divided between the Serpentshead\nand  the  Dragon  Coast.  Dwarovar,  however,  is  the  name  branded to it by the dwarves\nresiding within. In literal translation it means "Dwarf Home".\n\n==Geography==\n===Subcontinents===\nComprised  of  numerous  tunnels  and  massive caverns, the Serpentspine's geography is at\nmany  times  considered  wild  and  complex.  The extensive Aul-Dwarov rail system flows\nthroughout  the  continent  to the various dwarven holds.

From\nthe  Jade Mines in the east to the diamonds of Arg-Ôrdstun, the Serpentspine has produced\nthe  highest quality of gems for traders to buy. Ruby, citrine, amber, and the like have been\na source of immense wealth for the races of the Serpentspine.\n*Metals such as copper and iron are abundant in the Serpentspine.

The  shadow  liches  and  night hags take both sides in this war, but also come into\nconflict  with  each  other  over  their  opposing  ideology  on  the Shadow Plane itself: the\nshadow  liches  wish  to  keep the status quo to prolong their life by preventing the Shadow\nPlane  from  bleeding  further into the Prime Material, and the night hags wish the Shadow\nPlane  to  consume  the Prime Material and beyond to maximize suffering across the planes\nof existence.\n\n===Fugue Plane or Fugue Demesne?===\nFor  much  of  history the Fugue Plane, the personal domain of the Cannorian god of death\nNerat was treated as a separate plane or demiplane closely related to the Shadow Plane, but\nnonetheless separate.\n\nAfter  the  explorations  of  the  Ravelian  Church  in  the  17th  and  18th centuries it was\nrevealed  that  demiplanes  exist  only  in the Infernal and Celestial Planes, and the Parallel\nPlanes of the Prime Material, Feyrealm and Shadow Plane do not have demiplanes.\n\nInstead,  the Fugue Plane was in fact the places of authority within the Shadow Plane where\nthe  Red  Reapers  (and  Nerat,  if  he  ever  existed)  had authority. This was based in and\naround the Crumbling City, the parallel of Castonath.\n\n==Notable Locations==\n===Parallel Locations and Time Flux===\nAs  the  Shadow  Plane  is  a  parallel  of the Prime Material, most if not all features in the\nPrime  Material,  from  mountains  to houses will feature in the Shadow Plane. Due to the\ndecay of the plane, however, the state of these may be different.\n\nUnlike the Feywild, however, which has been found to have only geographic parallels (e.g.\na  coursing river or cliff is the same in both, but a building will not), the Shadow Plane has\na concept of time of ''when'' a place is that is shifting: the same dried out lake may house a\nruined  boathouse  from  the days of Castanor one visit, whereas the next it may contain the\nhusk of a great factory from the Age of Artificers."
 page_events.2715.t: "Shadow Plane 3 / 3"
 page_events.2715.d: "\n\nWhat  is  known, however, is that when a place might be is influenced by the chronological\norigins of the living beings visitng that area: a group of explorers from the Age of Artificers\nhave  a greater chance of seeing ''their'' Prime Material reflected. This has allowed strange\ncases  when  two  individuals  from  different time periods (due to the strange way time can\nwork) can meet in the Shadow Plane, and one individual ends up seeing decaying structures\nfrom the future.\n\n===The Crumbling City===\nThe  parallel  of  the  Prime  Material's  Castonath.  Repentant  souls live their life here in\nlimbo  in  servitude  to the city and Nerat's armies against the fiends of the Eternal War, as\nwell  as  living  inhabitants  like  outcasts,  lost  travelers and even opportunistic mages and\nmerchants.  As  long  as  they  subscribe  under  the  authority  of the Red Reapers they are\nallowed to stay.\n\nDespite  its  name,  the  Crumbling  City  is  not  all  crumbling and some parts have been\nmaintained  by  the Red Reapers. It is also one of the constants to the Time Flux present in\nthe  Shadow  Plane, resembling Castonath at its height before the Dragonwake. The reason\nof  this  is  largely  unexplained.  Most  theorize  that  it is by the Red Reapers' own doing,\nwhilst  others  believe  that  Castonath/The  Crumbling City is natural planar constant that\nbrings stability in the often shifting planes of existence.\n\nFinally,  unlike  Castonath,  the  Crumbling  City  actually  spreads  much  farther than the\noriginal  city's  extent,  and  a  myriad  of  settlements  and  urban  sprawl  representing all\narchitectures and time periods built by would-be migrants spread from its walls.\n\n===The Bleed===\nTODO Notes: Where Yezel Mora links to\n\nThe   main   place   where   the   Shadow  Plane  bleeds  into  the  Prime  Material  is  the\nshadowswamps  of  the  Yezel Mora in Sarhal. According to mago-archaeologists, the bleed\nbegan  some  time  during  the  Rule  of Dragons due to some evidence of ancient draconic\nmagic  at  play. The bleed grew slowly through the aeons, corrupting the lands and allowing\ncreatures  of  the  Shadow  Plane  like  night  hags  to  emerge.  The  slow  growth stopped\nsuddenly,  which  according  to  MELEF  CREATION MYTH was when their angels came\ndown and beat back the night hags, and since then had seen little to no spread."

 page_events.1339.d: "\nThe  Shatha  Motsa  (Middle  Land)  Confederation  was an alliance of minor tribes in the\ncentral  Ogre  Valley  that  existed between 126AA-507AA. The confederation was initially\ncreated  to  be  a foil against what many ogres saw as a tyrannical Kingdom of Maghargma,\nbut  its  internal politics would quickly come to be dominated by the ruthless Spinebreaker\nClan.   At   its  height,  the  confederation  would  encompass  lands  that  would  later  be\nrecognized as the territories of the Remlygenjrot, Garsvulshim, and Achtejardon clans.\n\nRelations  between  the Shatha Motsa and Kingdom of Maghargma would be icy at best for\nthe  entirety  of  the  confederation's  existence,  and  border  skirmishes  between the rival\npowers  were  commonplace.  The  eventual  collapse  of the Shatha Motsa and subsequent\nabsorption  into  Maghargma  would  be  driven by three primary factors. First, the loosely\norganized  nature  of  the confederation would lend to an almost equal amount of resources\nexpended   on   infighting   as  were  spent  on  fighting  common  enemies.  Secondly,  the\nconfederation  had  to  deal with the Wild Ogres to its north in addition to the Kingdom to\nits south, while Maghargma had a secure flank in the form of the Serpentspine. Finally, the\ndominant  Spinebreakers  were  far  less  apt  at  diplomacy  than their southern neighbors,\nallowing the Maghargmans to freely direct their centaur allies to raid the confederation.\n\nUltimately, the fate of the confederation would be decided at the Battle of the Rotting Plain\nin  507AA  after  having  launched  a  life-or-death  assault  on Maghargma. The battle was\nso-known  for  the  sheer  volume  of  corpses left behind that by the end of the fighting the\nremaining  survivors  were  physically  unable  to consume them all, leaving the rest to rot.\n(To  ogres of that time, to rot away was seen as a great desecration upon the body and soul.\nMany  today  still  believe  that the site of the battle is cursed by the corrupted spirits of the\nrotten warriors.)\n\nDespite  being  de-jure  dissolved  for  centuries,  the  ogres  that  live in the former Shatha\nMotsa  territories  are  still  stereotypically  prone  to  independence  streaks, often valuing\nmembership  to  their  own clan or kelaktar over citizenship to Maghargma or membership\nin the ogre race as a whole, as is more common to their south."

The  war  was  started at the height of the Decades of the Mountain, and the\nTemple  of  Bosancovac  was  the initial target. By attacking Bosancovac, the King of High\nHavoral,  Jahanon,  aimed  to  use  the  dam  as a bridge to invade the Dragon Dominion's\nlands.\n\n==The Battle==\nThe  attack  came  in  the  dead of night, started by High Havoral using pontoon bridges to\ncreate  a  pathway  to  the  floating  city. The Paddleboard Knights attempted to destroy the\nbridges  by  throwing  bombs,  but  were stopped by Havoric magirifles. Bosancovac’s navy,\nequipped  with  bomb  launchers, then bombarded the bridges; however, they were sunk by\nFalah’s Hunters before any substantial damage was done to the bridges.\n\nWith  the  bridges  in  place,  Falah’s  Hunters  along  with  knights  of  Sarda  that pledged\nthemselves  to  High  Havoral  charged  into  the  town  square  where  they  were  met  by\nCannorian  mercenaries  and  the Bosancovac City Guard. Meanwhile, the remnants of the\nBosancovac  navy  started  evacuating  the  town  to  the  shores  of  the  Dragon Dominion\nstarting   with  the  priests  and  patricians.  With  this,  word  got  out  to  the  Dominion,\nDrevkenuc, and Amacimst, and they all started rallying their forces to relieve the siege.\n\nThe first to arrive was the leader of the Dragon Dominion, the dragon Varlengeilt. Rushing\nto  Bosancovac  to  buy time for his troops to arrive, Varlengeilt harried the Havoric troops\nwith  his fire while staying at a distance. The Paddleboard Knights proved a good resistance\nagainst  High  Havoral's  troops;  however, despite their efforts and Varlengeilt’s assistance,\nBosancovac  fell  to  High  Havoral only a few hours before the reinforcing armies arrived.\nWhile  the  reinforcements  were  on the way, the Havorics made their way through the city,\nlooting  whatever  they  could  find.  When the combined troops of Amacimst, Drevkenuc,\nand  the Dragon Dominion arrived, the Havoric troops started to make their retreat to haul\nback  their  loot.  However,  just  as  they  were  going  to leave the city, a seeming miracle\noccurred.

This period would see the\nvarious  sieges  of  the  Serpentreach  and the fall of its holds, though no progress would be\nmade against the Segbandal for the over 5,000 year period.\n\n=== The Breach ===\nAfter  88 years of brutal warfare attempting to break into the Serpentreach, in 5000 BA the\norcs  managed  to  breach  the  mountains and seize control over the Argrod Junction. Even\nwith  the  Junction  taken,  the  orcs  then found themselves facing the might of the tenuous\nalliance of the Serpentreach holds led by Arg-Ôrdstun with the exception of Gor Bûrad and\nas such made little progress for numerous years.\n\nBranching  off  the  Argod  Junction,  the  orcs  would suffer minor setbacks as they headed\nsoutheast  towards  and  by  the Basalt Dwarves but ultimately forced the dwarves to retreat\nback  into their hold. The Gor Bûradic dwarves, defiant of Arg-Ôrdstunic rule, were alone\nand  believed that they would do best that way. With the upper Argrod line undefended, the\norcs  began  to  sweep  through  the  southeastern  rails  up to the very gates of Gor Bûrad.\nBeginning  in  5284  BA,  the  siege  of  Gor  Bûrad  would  result  in countless skirmishes\nbetween  the  orcs  and  the  dwarves  who  wielded  far  superior  knowledge  of  their own\nvolcano.\n\nEven  by  4839  BA,  over a hundred years since breaching the Serpentreach, little progress\nhad  been  made  by  the  orcs in terms of western progress. This roaming horde, no longer\ndirected  by  Ducaniel,  proved  to  be  less effective than prior against the well trained and\ndisciplined dwarven armies. Still, with their superior numbers progress was still made.\n"

Ruled by King Lorim the Warmheart who, although known for his immense love for\nhis people and benevolent rule, recognized the threat that the orcs provided. Despite Ovdal\nLodhum's  subservience  to  Arg-Ôrdstun  King  Lorim made the choice to pull the Garnet\nDwarves back from the front lines and into the hold, sealing the gates.\n\nUnlike the other holds that found themselves starving and cut off from the world, when the\nsiege  began  in  4624 BA Lodhum would find themselves relatively unbothered. Said to be\n"bound  by  love"  more  than  heritage,  there  are  no records of attempted harm between\ndwarf,  that  each  dwarf  shared food equally, and that some would even sacrifice their own\nshares  for  those  in  need.  It  is  commonly  agreed  that  this is what allowed the Garnet\nDwarves  to  survive  where other holds had failed. The orcs, engaged by the other dwarves\nof the Serpentreach, quickly gave up on their futile attempts on Lodhum's gates and instead\ncontinued a slow advance west.\n\n=== The Labyrinth ===\nAfter  bypassing  Ovdal  Lodhum  the  orcish  horde  found  their way to the Hold of verkal\nSkomdihr,  yet were unable to actually reach the hold. Standing between them and the hold\nwas  Kekig's  Labyrinth.  Multitudes  of orcs went into the labyrinth but no orc was able to\nbreach  past  it,  leaving  Verkal  Skomdihr  safe.  By 4611 BA the Flint Dwarves retreated\nback   into   the   hold  regardless  and  locked  the  gates  as  the  orcs  continued  towards\nArg-Ôrdstun.\n\n=== The Diamond Queen ===\nWithout  Ovdal  Lodhum  and  Verkal  Shomdihr,  the  alliance led by Arg-Ôrdstun found\nthemselves  at  roughly  half  their  original strength.

Being surface holds they were able to scavenge, farm,\nand  trade  on the surface even with their entrances to the Serpentspine cut off, The rails of\nthe Serpentreach then came fully under the control of the orcish hordes.\n\n=== Bûrad's End ===\nThe  siege  of Gor Bûrad which had begun 1643 years earlier finally reached its conclusion\nin  3641  BA when the the volcano Ghelebûr Krakdhûm erupted and allowed lava to creep\ninto  the  upper levels of Gor Bûrad.

To this\nday  the  gnolls  are  synonymous  with  slavery,  and were seen as the scourge of the Age of\nAntiquity,  enslaving  many (mostly human) peoples across the Sarhal and Bulwar to sell to\nthe  great  early  civilizations  of  the time such as Kheterata and the Genie remnants in the\nFangaula savanna.\n\n== Bulwari Slavery ==\nThe  relationship  between  the  Bulwari  and  slavery  is ancient and complicated. Records\nindicate  that  the  Sun  Cult prohibited slavery during its classical period, but scholars still\ndebate  about  the  specifical  date.  The widespread theory, based on the works of (Biegel’s\nchronicler),  states  that  the taboo arose in response to the Great Xhaz, around 650 BA, as\nslavery  became  permanently  associated  with  the  Xhazobkult.  Other  scholars, the most\nprominent  being  Nuršin  Gillu-gameš,  believe  that  the  taboo  could be older, and even\npredate the Cult, dating back to the Karqašlu Empire.\n\nThe  founding  myth of the Bulwari as an ethnic group is that they were slaves to the djinn,\nand  later  to  gnolls,  so it makes sense for them to have developed a rejection of slavery in\nthe  early  stages of their civilization. However, we find evidence of Bulwari being enslaved\nby  other Bulwari during most of their history, until the taboo on slavery was fully enforced\nfrom   the  Age  of  the  Phoenix  onwards.  The  Jaddari  conquest  of  Bulwar  ended  the\ninstitution  of  slavery in Bulwar by conquering the Harra oasis and the Šad Sur mountains,\nthe last strongholds of the gnolls in the subcontinent.\n\nBefore  the  Age  of  the  Phoenix,  Bulwari  slave  owners  were generally shunned by their\ncommunities,  becoming dependent on gnoll trade and rule to survive. Contrary to popular\nbelief,  the major source of Bulwari slaves was debt slavery, not warfare between city-states,\nkingdoms, and gnolls packs. We also find a large number of slaves coming from Sarhal and\nRahen,  especially  during  the Merchant Queendoms period of the Age of Petty Kingdoms,\nwhen the Suncrown Gnoll rule of Bulwar was at its heigh."

Slavery under Castanor largely depended\non  the  emperor  at  the time, with some like Castan the Progenitor, being the founder and\nformer  slave,  was  vehmently against slavery. Others such as Castan Beastbane and Castan\nGiantsbane  were  said  to  tolerate the enslavement of non-humans, and others like Castan\nthe Great was said to have built the expansion of his empire by enslaving defeated tribes.\n\nIt  would  be  a  breakaway  state  of  Castanor,  the Damerian Republic, that would benefit\ngreatly  with  slavery,  as  by  that  time  the  members  of  the  republic  had  been born of\ncolonists,  merchants  and  Cannorian  tribes,  who  overall  were  far from the influence of\nCastanor  proper  and  thus  held  no  qualms  in  the  Castanorian origin story of liberated\nslaves.\n\n=== Orcish Slavery ===\nThe  end  of  the Greentide was the defeat of the orcish clans that threathened Escann. The\nrise  of  the  adventurer-formed  countries  of  Escann  coincided  with  the  Rediscovery of\nAelantir,  which increased demand of reliable and sturdy labourers to form the foundations\nof  colonies and later on, its massive plantations. What began first as a resolution to get rid\nof  their  orcish  prisoners  to  these  colonial  initiatives (which surviving orcish kingdoms\npartook  in to, selling rival clan members) eventually became a booming business that gave\nthe   Escanni   kingdoms   wealth   in  order  to  rebuild  the  land.

Even after his passing and the rise of zealotry within the Corinite faith, many\nfirebrands  began  to  equate slavery as a form of decadence that should be attributed to the\nlikes of their decadent counterpart: the Regent Court.\n\n=== Anbennarian Green Orc Trade Ban ===\nWhile  it  originated as a Corinite ideal (which, despite its origins under Corin who fought\nagainst  orcs  in the Greentide, saw slavery as an evil act), various princes and merchants of\nthe  Empire  of  Anbennar  managed  to pass an edict in the imperial parliament to ban the\ntrade of orcish slave in Anbennar in 1589.\n\nAs  this  did  not  ban  the  keeping  of  slaves  themselves,  this  is  seen  by  contemporary\nhistorians  as  a  law  motivated by political concerns rather than moral ones to counter the\ngrowing threats to the Empire, such as:\n\n*  the  growing  power  of  a  resurgent  Escann,  made  up  of  countries  forged  by former\nadventurers, now growing rich in enslaving their former orcish invaders\n*  the  rise of the imperial city of Vertesk, which was at the centre of the slave trade via the\nriver  Alen  -  which  tipped  the  balance of power between them and two other mercantile\npowers of the Dameshead, Beepeck and Damescrown\n*  the rediscovery of Aelantir and its many plantations reliant on orcish slaves, spearheaded\nby  imperial  rivals  like Lorent, chartered companies like the Calasanni Trading Company\nand independent pioneers in the Trollsbay and beyond\nThe  edict had varying degrees of success and enforcement, and during its early years it was\nhardly enforceable due to the Emperor's limited authority within the Empire of Anbennar -\nand  states  like Vertesk even outright refusing to acknowledge such the edict. However the\nban did eventually work, and its unprofitability caused the Escanni slavers to abandon mass\nbreeding  and  enslavement  by  the  time of the Witch Kings Era, which in turn drastically\nslowed the export from places like Vertesk."

Even during the Witch Kings Era,\nwhen  Escann suffered under the yoke of powerful mage-kings, slavery remained unpopular\nexcept  for  the  most  sadistic  of  monarchs.  Some  witch  kings  saw  it  as  uncouth  and\nunbecoming  of their nations, as they had often tried to mimic and legitimize themselves to\ntheir  western counterparts, doing little to revive slavery as a major trade. Rósande was one\nof  the  few  exceptions,  though  the keeping of slaves there is largely seen more as term of\ntwisted prestige than for economic purpose.\n\nIn  Aelantir,  however, slavery flourished, and many plantation owners, especially in placed\nlike  Marlliande  tripled  their  efforts  in  producing  their  own  orcish  slaves born in the\ncontinent  rather  than  relying  on  Cannor.

 page_events.1365.d: "\n''This article is about the region of Small Country, for the nation, see Small Country''\n\nThe Small Country is a region in Western Cannor, surrounded by the regions of Lencenor,\nDragon  Coast,  Damescrown,  and  West Dameshead. The region, known for its bountiful\nfields  and  farmlands, is the homeland of the Cannorian Halfling race, but it has long been\nruled by the foreign powers of Western Cannor.\n\n==Geography==\nThe  Small  Country  is  bound  to south by the Redglades and the Ruby Mountains, to the\nwest by the Portroy River, and to the north by the Dragonhills. Historically, portions of the\nDamescrown  and  West  Dameshead—namely Beepeck, Uelaire, and the city of Orston in\nExwes—were  considered  part  of  the  Small  Country  as  well  until the formation of the\nEmpire  of  Anbennar, after which the Small Country's eastern bounds were marked by the\nElkwood to the north and the Ruby River to the south.\n\nMultiple  rivers  run  through  the  region,  watering  its  many  farms and orchards. In the\nnortheast,  the  mighty  Widderoy  flows  southward  along  the forested Approach, looping\neastward  to  rush  through  Greymill,  cutting  through  the  halfling city of Viswall before\nmeeting  the  Ruby  River  and  escaping into the Dameshead through the Saltmarshes soon\nafter. In the west, the westward-flowing Burroy divides the lands of Appleton and Pearview\nbefore  joining  the  Portroy  at  Turnwell, from which halfling goods make their way to the\ngnomish  city  of  Portnamm.  All  other  western  trade  flows  along  the  more  southerly\nMiddanroy,  which  starts in the hills of Coppertown and lazily meanders until it enters the\nRedglades and eventually meets the sea at Westport.\n\n==History==\nThe  Small  Country  was  originally inhabited by Proto-Lencori tribes of humans. Around\n11000  BA,  the  ancestors  of the Cannorian halflings and gnomes arrived at the Shattered\nBay, slowly spreading over the years inland and mingling with their taller neighbors.\n"

 page_events.2729.d: "\nIn 873 BA the Gnomish Hierarchy began expanding beyond the Dragon Coast, establishing\nthe  Small  Province  over  their  halfling  subjects  within  the Portroy basin. The province\nwould  eventually lend its name to the whole region as Hierarch influence spread eastward,\nculminating  in  the  foundation  of Beepeck as their eastern capital in 625 BA. Though the\nGnomish  Hierarchy contested its Dameshead frontiers against the Damerian Republic and\nCastanor during the various Wars of Dominion, the Small Country remained firmly within\nthe Hierarchy's control.\n\nThis  would  change  during  the  Dragonwake  in  470  as  many  leading  officials  of  the\nHierarchy  and  their  stationed  army  fled  the  region  to  protect  their homelands in the\nDragon  Coast.  While  this  allowed  the  Small Country more autonomy, it also left them\nvulnerable  to  attack  from  invading  Alenic  migrants.  Following  the  foundation  of the\nGawedi  Kingdom,  the  Gawedi would sack the city of Beepeck in 472 and begin invading\nthe  Small  Country and Lencenor in earnest in 475. The majority of Lencori tribes such as\nthe  Rubenti  would  flee  southward  into  Lencenor;  a  Hillfoot  warlord  would unite the\nfractured halflings who remained into the Small Kingdom in 478 to organize a defense with\nmixed  success. When the Lorenti king Lorenan the Great united the southern humans into\nthe  Kingdom  of  Lorent,  the  two  nations  joined  forces and successfully drove back the\nGawedi to the Dragonhills in 530. So began a new era began for the Small Country, one in\nwhich Lorent and Gawed jockeyed for control over its bountiful farmlands.\n\nDuring  the War of the Sorcerer-King Beepeck was razed by mage-fire under the command\nof  Ettalinde the Wretched. The attack became a precursor to the Invasion of Lorent which\ncontinued  until  its  liberation  by  the  recently  arrived Elf forces and the remnants of the\nLeague  of  Free  Realms.  The  liberation  of  Beepeck  and  subsequent  freeing  of  many\nHalflings  who  were once enslaved by Black Castanor spurred the occupied Small Country\nto  rise  in  rebellion  against  the  occupying forces. After the war, the halfling hero Finnic\nShadowhand  would  be  elected  king  for  helping  kill  the  Sorcerer King, he would later\nbecome Finnic síl Vis.\n"

Due to their relative isolation from the plains of Enteben and the Bay of Wines, the\nSormanni  were  slower  to  adopt  Common  and  the  Castanorian pantheon. A Sormanni\nchieftain,  Crovan  Spearsworn, would establish an offshoot of the tribe—the Crovanni—in\n58  and  introduce the Cult of Adean to Lencenor, which the Sormanni would reject for the\nrest  of  their  early  history.  Their  religious  differences would cause the Crovanni to ally\nmore with the surrounding Entebics rather than their cousin tribe.\n\nDespite  coming  under  the  Damerian  Republic’s  influence and its successor the Lencori\nEmpire, the Sormanni Kingdom was only loosely-held and would come into its own during\nthe  Lencori  Warlord  Period.

It is for this reason that the\ncorridor  from  Sornsbay  to  Fíoncavin  along  the  river  is  known  as the Sórncost Vines.\nSornsbay  and  Sornaire,  along with the nearby Sornhills, are also locations which get their\nname  from  the Sornroy river. The City of the Western Wine was built around the estuary\nof  the  Sornroy, where it empties into a small bay. The river not only alloys farmers to ship\ngrapes quickly and easily to the city, but its status as a sheltered port makes it a perfect stop\nfor  Wineport  or  Dameshead  ships  heading for Westport, or even Aelantir. The Sornroy\nriver  valley  is otherwise cut off from the rest of Lencenor, leading to the locals developing\na  distinct  culture,  different  from  the  rest  of  the  Wine  Lords. In 1444, the domain in\ncontrol  of  the  Sornroy  river  and surrounding area is the duchy of Sórncost, ruled by the\nSórncost Dynasty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Their progentior, Vukar, who,\ndespite being able to shapeshift, was tracked down and slain by Falah.\n* Siramod - Minotaurs: the rarest of the Spawns of Agrados, being solitary, and scant found\noutside  their  homes  in  underground  ruins  and  caves,  with  labyrinthine layouts. Their\nprogenitor, Siramod, was the first to be slain by Falah, which explains why they are so few.\n* Dolumir - Satyrs: a half-faun half-human race that lived across the Old Deepwoods when\nit  spanned  much  of  Escann.

 page_events.1381.d: "\nSpellcasting  focus  were  items  used  to  help a spellcaster focus and cast spells, they often\ntook the form of staves and wands though rings, gems and bracers exist.\n\n==Usage==\nUsing  a  spellcasting  focus  allows  the user to easily manipulate and aim their spells with\nminimal  harm  to the user, in some cases, an aide may even improve a spell's quality, such\nas its accuracy and precision.\n\nCasting  spells  without  aides  is  possible and regarded as highly advanced and dangerous,\nallowing  the  caster  to fine-tune and cast more advanced spells with their fingers. Without\nan  aide  to  act  as  a  magical rod and barrier between magic and the user, evocative spells\nsuch  as  fireballs  may  harm the user if proper wards are not in place, a slight finger in the\nwrong place may end up with a loss of a hand or more.\n\nWhile  foci exist to aid the user in control spells and protecting the user, some also include\nsome  form  of Damestear which can act as a magical reservoir where that the mage can tap\ninto  to  amplify  their  spells  or  restore  their  own  magical  resevoirs (mana). The most\nprominent example of this are magical orbs and rings.\n\n== Types ==\n=== Staves ===\nThe  staff  is the most common spellcasting aide. The staff allows the user to make broader\nstrokes  for  more  powerful  and  area  effect spells along with acting as a walking stick for\nmore  elderly  mages.  Staves  are often made of wood and adorned with crystals which can\nboost magical prowess.\n\n=== Wands ===\nWands are generally seen as a smaller version of the staff, it allows for quicker, precise and\nmore  delicate  spellcasting  at  the expense of power. Like staves, wands are often made of\nwood  and  can  have  decorative yet useful ornaments. In later years, it was discovered that\nivory   more  efficiently  conducted  magic,  eventually  supplanting  wood  as  the  primary\nmaterial  for  wands.  These  foci  are  often  used  by the young, beginner and journeyman\nmages or those who prefer casting with the wrist."
 page_events.2739.t: "Spellcasting focus 2 / 3"
 page_events.2739.d: "\n\n=== Rings ===\nA  more  discrete  spellcasting  aide, rings allow the user to emulate calibrative spellcasting\nand  acts  as  a safety procedure, absorbing excess magical power if need be. Most rings are\nmade  of  metal  and  often come with protective enchantments like any other magical ring,\nthe  most common enchantment for spellcasting rings are protective wards to avoid harm to\nthe user's hands.\n\n=== Bracers ===\nBracers  acts  similarly  to  the ring, allowing the user to emulate calibrative spellcasting. If\nthey  say  a  ring  is  like  a  wand then a bracer is like a staff, allowing for slower but more\npowerful  spells.  A  bracer  can  absorb  more  excess  magical  power  than  a  ring but its\nposition  on  the  wrists  means  the user cannot use their fingers as much to fine-tune their\nspells,  spellcasting  with  a bracer often requires broad and strong gestures using the whole\nhand rather than fingers.\n\n=== Orbs ===\nAn  uncommon  yet  powerful  spellcasting  aide,  orbal  spellcasting  was a prominent aide\nduring  the Age of Antiquity when Bulwari and Kheteratan spellcasting was most common -\nin  recent  history  the  only  primary practitioners of orbal spellcasting are the Bulwari war\nwizards.  The  orbs'  ability  to  levitate allows the user to have different positions of firing,\nfrom hovering beside the user or being wielded much akin to throwing a ball.\n\nSpellcasting  with  an  orb,  is actually difficult on its own, and is often paired with rings or\nbracers.  Orbs  are  actual  full of liquified damestear, allowing the mana stored inside it to\nbe  later  drawn  for  more  powerful  spells.  Bulwari  war  wizards were often recorded in\nwielding  as  much  as  six  orbs  allowing them to draw magical power and cast devastating\nspells from atop their mage platforms.\n\n=== Martial Weapons ==="
 page_events.2740.t: "Spellcasting focus 3 / 3"
 page_events.2740.d: "\nIn  some  cases weapons have been used for spellcasting though it has generally be found as\nclumsy  and difficult to harness, aim and wield spells using this method due to their length,\nimpracticality,  the  chance  to  harm  the  user itself, and the fact that the user may have to\nsplit  time between casting and fighting with the weapon. The user could just wear a ring or\nbracer which offers a much more stable spellcasting platform anyhow.\n\nGenerally,  daggers and spears fare better due to their similarities to staves and wands, with\nits only exception being precursor spellblades and its ancient art of Diranbe.\n\n===Instruments===\nInstruments  such  as  lutes and flutes are the main aides for bardic magic, exchanging hand\ngestures  or musical notes instead. Music's rigidity in concrete notes allows for spells to be\ncast  more  easily,  though  they  are  more  difficult  to be fine-tuned, and its noise-making\nability makes it suited (or only compatible) for area-of-effect spells.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Over time, the name became associated with Balgar\nthe  Builder,  himself  an  exile,  who had built many great works for Castanor using stone,\nbecoming a source of pride for the Escanni dwarves.\n\nBecause  the  Stone  Dwarves  founded  their  clans after their migration from Aul-Dwarov,\nmany  of  them  reference  Escann  in  some way. This makes it easy to trace the ancestry of\nCannorian  dwarves  with  many of the same clans appearing repeatedly across Castanorian\nhistories.   The   well-known   clans   are   the   Azcanne   (Cannorian),   Azozcanne  (East\nCannorian),  Azbal  (of Balgar), and Adstunad (tunnel passage). Many of these clan names\nare  shared  with  the  Silver  Dwarves  given  their  common  origin. The Adstunad clan in\nEscann  specifically  comes  from  the  dwarves  of  the  Havoral  Divide  who  returned  to\nCastanor around the time of the War of the Falling Stars.\n\nFor  a  long time the stone dwarves were the largest group of surface dwarves in history and\nwere  a  respected  part  of  Castanorian Empire and were given great autonomy to function\nand  live  within  its  reach.  However,  due  to  the Greentide in 1424 many stone dwarves\nbecame  refugees  like  the  rest  of  their Escanni counterparts and sought safety in western\nCannor,  making  the  silver  dwarf  culture  most  dominant  after  the  Greentide as many\nformer refugees decided to stay, primarily within the Empire of Anbennar.\n\n== History ==\nWhile  much  of  history talks of Balgar the Builder, he was in fact one of the many surface\ndwarves  that  already  lived  in Escann by the time the Castanites arrived. During this time\nthe dwarves had lived alongside the Escanni people in relative peace, but largely keeping to\nthemselves  or  teaching  them rudimentary crafts. It was only after Castan the Progenitor's\nrecruitment  of  Balgar and his eventualy consolidation of the Escann did the stone dwarves\nintegrate with human society."

From  there,  he  launched  a  series  of  campaigns  across Bulwar. The\ncampaign  against  the Harpylen Queendom being the most drawn out among them, having\nlasted  from  1010  to 1019.

The legions managed to contain some roosts, trapping the harpies\ntherein  and  starving  them  of  any  resources.  After  many years of suffocating sieges, the\nmatriarchs  of  the  remaining  roosts of Siadanlen surrendered one by one until the back of\nSiadanlen was broken.\n\n==Aftermath==\nAfter  Jaher’s legions finished subduing the harpies, they recovered their strength for 6 years\nbefore  resuming  their  march  and  entering into Rahen.

 page_events.1395.d: "\nThe  Sunrise  Convocation  was  the  system of government of the Sunrise Empire. It was a\nrepresentative  form  of  government,  in  which each district was assigned a convocationary\nofficial. The convocation itself was located in the capital of Sarisung.\n\n=== Convocationary Officials ===\nConvocationary  officials  were  fully comprised of Sunrise Elves, to the dismay of some. It\nwas  said  that  only the elves had the vision and long term planning needed to maintain the\ndelicate  balance  of  unity  on  which  the  Sunrise  Empire  was built. They served both as\ngovernors  of  their  district,  and  as  representative  in  the  convocation  of  said  district.\nTraining to become a convocationary official was a rigorous and extensive process, with the\naverage  student  taking  forty years to complete the program, being trained in a plethora of\nsubjects,  such  as  philosophy,  economics,  governance, and diplomacy. Active scouting of\ncandidates  for  convocationary officials was started at a young age, especially for elves, but\nmost  elves  tend  to  enroll  in  the  High  Dawn  Academy between the ages of forty and a\nhundred  years  old. Enrollment to the academy came with the swearing of an oath to serve\nthe  empire  as  a  convocationary, with minimal service being a hundred years, made up of\n16 service terms and 4 break terms.\n\n=== Supreme Convocationary ===\nThe  Supreme  Convocationary was the head of state of the Sunrise Empire. Each Supreme\nConvocationary  served  for  fifty years, and could only serve for one term, and was elected\nfrom  the  members  of the convocationary by a popular vote. The supreme convocationary\nhad the ability to veto any motion made by the convocation, although this ability was rarely\nused. Hiderion Tonanzuir served as the first supreme convocationary.\n\n=== Convocation ===\nThe  Convocation  is  located  in  Sarisung,  at  the center of both the capital and the entire\nempire.  The  number  of  convocationaries was fluid, but the average number tended to be\naround  five  hundred  officials. Councils were held every day, in which any convocationary\nwas  free  to  attend  and  suggest  legislation,  motions,  or  edicts.  On the last day of each\nmonth,  the  convocation  was  fully  assembled,  and  issues  were  voted  on. At least sixty\npercent of the convocation had to be in favor for a motion to be approved."

 page_events.2741.d: "\n\n=== Terms ===\nTo  ensure  the  ideals  of  the  Sunrise  Empire  were  not corrupted by personal greed and\nnepotism,  each  convocationary  served each district for a term of five years. Four of those\nwere spent governing the district itself, while the last year was spent acting in the interest of\nsaid  district  on  the  Convocation.  Districts  were  assigned per lottery, to minimalize the\nchance  of  any  convocationary  to establish a powerbase in a region. After serving for four\nterms,  a  convocationary  was  mandated to take a five year break term, in which they were\ngiven  an allowance by the state to do whatever they wished. After serving for twenty terms,\nincluding  four  break  terms,  a  convocationary  was  allowed  to retire, though most were\nheavily encouraged to either continue service as a convocationary, or to become a professor\nat the High Dawn Academy.\n\n=== Travelling Convocationaries ===\nTrained  convocationaries (Often those that choose to continue their service after 20 terms)\nare assigned to travel from district to district and ensure that they are running smoothly and\njustly  by  their  representatives. They answer only to the supreme convocationary and have\nthe power to remove any convocationary from their position and send them to the academy\nfor retraining should they deem it neccesary.\n\n=== Convocationary Districts ===\nThe  Empire was organized in districts, which often maintained the administrative divisions\nof  previous  states.  Due  to the nature of the Sunrise Empire, each district could be vastly\ndifferent  in the way it was governed at the local level: the Sikai's local representatives were\nelected  leaders  of  the  various  townships,  The Raheni maintained their ministries (Now\nboth  consisting  of  Raheni  and  Harimari), and Lapnam Amrik's local representives were\nstill   selected   from   the   grand   tournament,   to   name  but  a  few  of  the  ways  local\nrepresentatives   were   acquired.   Regardless   of   how  each  district  acquired  it's  local\nrepresentatives,  they  all  sat  on  a  council,  led by the local convocationary official. This\ncouncil  drafted  new  edicts,  legislation,  and laws, over which the convocationary had the\nfinal  say. However, if the majority of the local representatives felt that their convocationary\nwas  acting  unjust,  they  could  petition  the  convocation  for a new convocationary, upon\nwhich  a  replacement  would  be  sent,  and  the  previously sitting convocationary with be\naudited by a pair of travelling convocationaries."

Sunrise  Elves  are one of the smallest groups of Elves, with the majority\nliving  in  Azkare  or  in  the  Porcelain  Cities.  The  most notable Sunrise Elf is Hiderion\nTonanzuir.\n\n== Name and Etymology ==\nThe  Sunrise  Elves  are named after Jaerel, often referred to as the Sunrise Emperor, as the\nelves  referred  to  Haless  as  the  sunrise continent due to its eastern position compared to\nBulwar.\n\n== History ==\nAfter  the  death  of Jaher and Jaerel soon after, Haless was in a state of chaos, as the native\npeoples  of  the  continent rose up against elven rule and started a pogrom against all elves.\nAs  a  result,  most  elves  either  died  or  fled  west  with  the  legions. The Sun Elves that\nremained,  most  forcibly  remaining, as travelling would likely cause death, would become\nthe current Sunrise Elves.\n\nYanshen\n\nThe  Regions  of  Yanshen  and  Xianjie  saw the most casualties, and the few Elves that did\nsurvive   there   were   often   those  on  the  edges  of  civilization  which  saw  little  elven\nintervention,  taking  up  solitude  professions  such as hunters and herbalists, or settling in\nfar-away  villages, away from authorities that would persecute them. Few elves attempted to\nseek  refuge  among  the  various  temples  in Xianjie, but most were killed or turned away,\neventually leading to the formation of the Nakhriban in Azkare.\n\nArawkelin\n\nArawkelin,  firmly  in  control by elf-friendly forces, never persecuted the elves and as such\ncame  to  host  large amounts of elves that did not wish to return to Bulwar. Many Elves in\nYanshen fled by boat rather than through the hostile lands of Xianjie, and while most sailed\non to Bulwar, some remained to form the military elite of Arawkelin."

Elven merchants often\nsaw  their  goods  confiscated,  they  received  longer  sentences  for  crimes, and had fewer\nprivileges,  including  not  being  allowed  to own land or serve in the military. As a result,\nmost  Sunrise Elves in the porcelain cities either became artisans, or were forced into a life\nof crime and squalor.\n\nRahen\n\nIn  Rahen,  fighting  had been fierce to subdue the harimari in the ascension peninsula, and\nas  a  result  many saw it fitting to take elven slaves, forcing them to serve their families for\ngenerations,  sometimes  in  positions  such  as  musicians  and  artists,  but  more often in\nhumiliating  positions such as dung shoveler or pleasure servant. Northern Rahen had little\nelven settlement, and the few garrisons that existed quickly had fled westwards to Bulwar.\n\n== Culture ==\nReligion\n\nReligion  among  Sunrise  Elves  was diverse, with some maintaining the worship of Surael,\nwhile  others  converted  to local faiths such as Righteous Path and High Philosophy. Most\nSunrise Elves, unlike the Sun Elves, rejected Jaher’s divinity, as a result of the abundance of\nfailures  that  occurred  in Haless. The center of Sun Cult worship in Haless was located in\nAzkare,  where a more radical faction called the Aistszur (Sons of the East) clung to the old\nways of Jaher, including the Sun cult."

The  Convocation  was  a  body  of elves that ruled not just the\nelves but all people living in Azkare. Arawkelin was not ruled by Sunrise Elves directly, but\nits  communities  were  often  ran  by  rich merchants or veterans from the time of Jaher or\ncampaigns against the Yanglam.\n\nBowmasters of Lektonmai\n\nThe  Elves in Lektonmai, just east of Azkare, took up the art of archery from the masters of\nXianjie. This led to the invention of the Bokar bow, a large, asymmetric bamboo bow, used\nfor  both  horse  archery  and  foot archers. The Bowmasters of Lektonmai became famous\nacross  all  of  Haless,  and  many  Sun  Elves took the journey to Lektonmai to learn from\nthese experts of archery, bringing the invention to Bulwar.\n\nKhanvuphaim\n\nKhanvuphaim  is  a  textile  made  with  feathers,  with  silk  like  qualities  of softness and\nstrength.

The concept of the Sunrise Empire was to unite the people of Haless\nunder  the  benevolent  rule of the Sunrise Elves, which would serve as arbiters between the\ndiverse  populations  that inhabit Haless. All cultures and religions of Halessi origin would\nbe  welcome  and  have equal opportunity in politics, each group was represented with a or\nseveral seats in the Sunrise Convocation. It was less open to cultures and religions it saw as\nforeign,  most  notably  The  Jadd  and  Ravelianism. It would stretch from the Serpenstine\nMountains to the Ringlet Sea; From the Ocean of the Lost to the Paravimvata.\n\nThe  Sunrise  Empire  was  an  attempt at reviving the ideals of the Sunrise Emperor, Jaerel\nJaherzuir.  Unlike  his  father  Jaher,  Jaerel  sought to seek not just conquest but unity and\nprosperity.  Hiderion  tried  to  emulate  this  throughout his reign of Azkare, but never got\nclose  to  being  as  successful  as  his  idealized empire, likely due to a combination of two\nfactors:  Hiderion  had  no  access to the Phoenix Legions or any similar military force like\nhis  predecessors,  and  the  legacy  of  Jaher  left  a mark on Haless, leading to most of it's\npeople having an innate distrust of any Elves.\n\n==Criticism==\nMany  members  of  the  Order  of Chroniclers criticize the concept of the Sunrise Empire,\nclaiming that it is ignorant of the history of Haless, and merely tries to apply the concept of\nthe  Phoenix  Empire  on  the  continent  of  Haless.  The  main  points  of criticism are as\nfollows:\n\n*  Since  the  departure  of  the  Phoenix  Legions  from  Haless,  there  was  only  a minor\npopulation   of   Elves   scattered   throughout   Haless(Mainly   centered   in  Azkare  and\nArawkelin),  which  would  not nearly provide a large enough pool of skilled governors and\njudges to populate the administration of the empire.\n*  There  has  never been an empire in all of history that has managed to unite all of Haless\nunder  one  banner,  and  the ones that came close (Namely, the Harimraj and the Phoenix\nEmpire)  All  had  a  large  force  of  elite  troops  to  aid  in  the  subjugation  of an entire\ncontinent.

Coming from a wealthy Harimari clan, Tarphenday studied at the Hall of\nEndless  Debate  in Rayavashapal in his youth and was heavily influenced by the writings of\nRama Nar Singh - particularly, the nature of chi in accordance to the balance of the world.\n\nComing   of   age  during  the  dissolution  of  Lianzhou,  the  Xianjie  Rebellion,  and  the\nsplintering  of  Harimari  dominance  over  Haless, Tarphenday found echoes of Rama Nar\nSingh's  words  about disorder in the world around him. Believing that only a truly ordered\nworld  could  prevent  devastation, Tarphenday laid out a series of reforms, laws, and codes\nthat  would  sculpt  and  redefine  the ancient Raheni Caste System. Iterating on the earlier\nreforms  of  Harimraja  Manava  I in 70 AA, Tarphenday's systemic codes were intended to\nfirmly  divide  those  within  Rahen  into  atomized  roles,  allowing  rulers  to  balance the\ncollective  chi  (or  Atma  in  his  native  Sarniryabsadi)  of  the  subcontinent  and prevent\ncollapse of Raheni society as a whole.\n\nTarphenday's  ideas  were  published  as an anthology of essays, ''On Righteous Society'', in\n210  AA,  and  rapidly  became  popular  with  the urban philosopher elite. In 215 AA, he\npublished  ''Dialogue  on  Atma'', a Ramaic discussion between himself and a monk of the\nRighteous Path which discussed the nature of chi, the role of individuals in its balance, and\nthe need of strong central authority to ensure that all conform to said balance.\n\nToday  Tarphenday is regarded by many as the architect of Rahen, sculpting the caste system\ninto  the  form  it  takes  today  and  for  which the subcontinent is so well known. As such,\nTarphenday  is  controversial  among  many  who  believe he placed millions of Raheni into\nlives  of  permanent  servitude, damaged the intention and integrity of the caste system, and\nallowed corrupt regimes like the Dhenijanraj to flourish.\n\nAn  infamous example of the consequences of the Typhoon of Broken Vases include that of\nTarphenday's  famous  portrait  being  stolen  by  Lorentish soldiers. The portrait would be\nsmuggled  eastwards,  making  its way through Corinsfield and supposedly onto the Shadow\nMarket  before  finding  its  way  into  the hands of a wealthy Anbennarian Nobleman.

 page_events.1409.t: "Taychendi Hero Worship 1 / 2"
 page_events.1409.d: "\nTaychendi Hero Worship is the native faith of the Taychendi peoples that emerged from the\nideologies of the first warlords that rose in Taychend following the Day of Ashen Skies. The\nfaith   is  a  loose  pantheon  of  “God-Heroes”,  great  individuals  that  transcended  their\nmortality  and  became  gods  after  their  death.  During the 15th-18th centuries, the faith\nwould  experience  a decline in its own homeland as the ideology of Kheionism, heresies of\nthe Sun Cult, Corinism, and Ravelianism spread among the Taychendi.\n\n==Theology==\n\n===Central Tenets===\nThe  Taychendi  believe  that  after  one’s death, they are reincarnated. To escape this cycle,\none must perform great feats in life, as becoming a legendary hero will allow one to ascend\nand  become a god upon death. Therefore, anyone can become a god after death, as long as\nenough followers recognize it.\n\nThe  actions  and  legendary  feats  needed to ascend vary greatly. An outsider at first might\nassume  that  only  warlords  and great kings could become gods, but this is not necessarily\nthe case. In many places in Taychend, you will find legendary smiths, writers, philosophers,\nmages,  adventurers  and  even  bureaucrats  worshiped as gods. Due to this, the amount of\ngods found in Taychend is uncountable.\n\n===Hero Cults===\nAn  important  aspect  of  the  Taychendi  faith  is  the  presence  of  hero  cults.  These are\norganizations   that   worship   a   specific   God-Hero,   believing  that  in  emulating  and\nworshipping  their  chosen  deity,  they  could  gain  favor  with  said  god  or  even  ascend\nthemselves.  Hero  cults  are  widespread  in  Taychend,  and  are  a  critical  part  in  daily\nTaychendi  life. These cults hold both religious and political influence and are a key part of\nthe  Taychendi  faith.  Every  Taychendi  god  has a hero cult of their own, and it is through\nthese cults that the Taychendi faith is practiced.\n"

 page_events.2747.d: "\n==Destiny And Fate==\nTraditionally  the  Taychendi  place  great  reverence  in  fate.  To  go against one’s fate is a\ndangerous move, as it is to defy the gods themselves. The payoff can be incredible however,\nas seen with the legendary actions of Erankar the Defiant, whose defiance of fate led him to\nfound the Larankar Empire and ascend to godhood.\n\n===Oracles===\nThere are a number of temples scattered throughout Taychend, whose halls contain oracles.\nThese  oracles  directly  speak  to  their god, and often give prophecies and warnings of the\nfuture.  It  is  tradition for every Taychendi ruler to visit an oracle at least once during their\nreign.\n\nThese  prophecies  can  have  profound  implications  for a ruler's reign. The most famous\nexample  being  when a Kheionai general named Laskaris visited the oracle at Korrimutren\nand  learned  the exact place and time of his demise, and that nothing could kill him before\nthen.  Using  this  effective  immortality,  he founded the Ambhen Empire by conquering a\nlarge portion of Taychend.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

It is\ndrunk  across  the  world,  though  some  regions  favor  it  more than others, and comes in\nvarieties depending on leaf size, processing methods, and origin.\n\nThe  kind  of  tea now found in Cannor and Bulwar is small-leaf tea originating in Aelantir\nand  arriving  with  the  Remnant  Fleet,  while  the Taychendi of southern Aelantir and the\nYanshen people grow large-leaf tea believed by some to be the original form of tea before it\nwas  modified to better suit elven tastes. The Taychendi maintain a grading system for their\ntea,  with  the  smallest  leaves  having  the greatest value, which many consider evidence in\nfavor of this theory.\n\nThe  primary  tea  producing  regions  of  Cannor  and Bulwar are those areas inhabited by\nelves, with the Elfrealm of Moonhaven and the island of Elizna being the most well-known.\nTea  is  produced  in  other  regions as well, but primarily for local consumption. Haless is\nalso  known  for  growing  tea,  having  done  since  time  immemorial.  This  tea  is of the\nlarge-leaf variety also seen in Taychend, though since Jaher's arrival the Halessi have begun\ngrowing  elven small-leaf tea as well as, and in many cases instead of, their native large-leaf\ntea.\n\n\n\n== Origins? ==\nMany elves stick to the belief that Tea is a native plant of Aelantir, and that their precursor\nancestors  introduced  it to the Yanshen people and the rest of the world. However, modern\nYan  scholars refute this and suggest that the precursors stole the native tea from their lands\nand cultivated it to the smaller tea leaves seen in Cannor and Aelantir today.\n\n\n\n== Tea Cultures and Blends =="

Eliznan Sunrise is a\nblack  tea  mixed  with  a  citrusy  oil  giving it a fresh smell and taste which is supposed to\nreinvigorate  the  one  drinking  it. When consumed by elves it is often spiced with a small\namount  of  honey  to enhance the flavor, while humans tend to prefer it sweeter with sugar\neither consumed alongside it or put in the drink itself.\n\nElven Silver\n\nProduced  primarily in Moonhaven and a popular tea blend in most of the Dameshead and\nCannor.  Elven Silver is a black tea mix, occasionally magically enhanced to give it a slight\nsilver  hue  which does not carry over to the brew. The blend is spiced with an aromatic oil\nmade  from  plants  from  old  Aelantir giving it a nostalgic smell and taste for many Elves,\nwhich in turn has come to be greatly appreciated by the other races as well.

 page_events.1415.t: "Temple of Bosancovac 1 / 6"
 page_events.1415.d: "\nThe  Temple  of  Bosancovac,  founded  in 956, is a mercantile theocracy in the Ynn. Built\natop  the  Ynn  on  a  reservoir created by the Bosancovac Dam, the city of Bosancovac was\nconstructed  to  float  on  the  water.  Due  to the increased importance of boats in the city,\nBosancovac  developed  the  first  and  only  navy  of  the Ynn complete with its own forces\nknown as the Paddleboard Knights. One of the newest cities of the Ynn, it grew to regional\nprominence  in  the  17th  century,  and  became  the  largest  city of Dolindha by the 18th\ncentury.\n\n==Etymology==\nBosancovac  comes  from  the  Dolindhan  words  "bos-"  meaning  bridge and "-ancovac"\nmeaning  merchant.  Together  the  name  means "The Merchant's Bridge" referring to the\nlarge amount of merchants and commerce in the city.\n\n==Government==\nThe  Temple  of  Bosancovac  was  a theocracy ever since the coup of 1224, prior to which\nthey  were  a  republic  led  by  a  mayor.  Over time however, once Bosancovac had grown\nprosperous  the  clergy  of  Bosancovac  was infiltrated by the patricians. In order to regain\nprevious  power  they  held,  the  patricians  raised  their children as priests in the hopes of\nbecoming  High Priest of Bosancovac. This overall created a government that while being a\ntheocracy, had elections held only between the patrician families.\n\n==Economy==\nThe  economy  of  Bosancovac  was historically largely derived from salt gathered from the\ninland  marshes  created by the reservoir, however over time the Bosancovaco exports grew\nto include processed animal goods such as lamp oil and rope made from the fat and leather\nof Dolindhan animals. With the discovery of explosives, Bosancovac started manufacturing\nbombs which boosted their economy significantly.\n\nA  large portion of Bosancovac’s economy was based in commerce. Sitting at the crossroads\nof  Sarda  and Dolindha, many merchants passed through the town or lived there and made\ndeals  with  travelers.  The  merchants  based  out  of Bosancovac also made trade deals all\nalong  the  Ynn using the Holy Merchant Fleet. As the only country in the Ynn with a naval\npresence,  it  created  a  natural advantage for the merchants. There were no restrictions on\nwho the traders, or the Temple itself, made deals with. Bosancovaco merchants were quick\nto  trade  with  the  Cannorians, since they brought new exotic goods with them and had no\nproblems  trading  with  the  Bosancovaco. Trading with the Cannorians was widely looked\ndown  upon  at  the  time by the Ynnics, but Bosancovac wasn’t concerned about that. They\nstayed  true  to  that  policy  no  matter  the  circumstances,  even being one of the very few\ntrading partners of High Havoral during the Decades of the Mountain."
 page_events.2752.t: "Temple of Bosancovac 2 / 6"
 page_events.2752.d: "\n\n==Demographics==\nThe  majority of Bosancovac is Dolindhan with a small population of Sarda. Starting in the\n16th  century,  they  became  the  home  to  various Cannorians as Bosancovac was open to\nanyone  who  had something to trade. They also were host to the first Gnomish community\namong the Ynnics when they arrived from the Gnomish Hierarchy in the 18th century.\n\nBosancovac is the largest city of Dolindha and one of the largest cities of North Aelantir. A\nlarge  amount  of  the  population  is made up of descendants of refugees from elsewhere in\nDolindha, having fled to Bosancovac as a safe haven.\n\n==Military==\nFirst  and  foremost the most unique part of Bosancovac’s military was their navy, being the\nonly  one  among  the  Ynnics.  A  mixture  of  gondolas  and canoes, the Bosancovac Holy\nMerchant  Fleet  was  a  common  sight  along the Ynn both in peacetime as well as during\nwars.   After  Bosancovac’s  independence  in  1205,  they  created  a  force  known  as  the\nPaddleboard  Knights.  While  the  founding members were hired mercenaries and landless\nknights,  the  Paddleboard  Knights over time became a formidable force, both well trained\nand well armed by the wealthy patricians of Bosancovac.\n\nWith the arrival of the Cannorians came the arrival of advanced weaponry. Bosancovac was\nrelatively  quick  to  incorporate the Cannorian technology and train their troops in the use\nof gunpowder weaponry. Once the production of bombs was underway, they too were added\nto  the  arsenal. Bombs were used by the Paddleboard Knights as well as by the navy in the\nform of bomb launches mounted on the vessels.\n\n==History==\n===Building the Dam===\nWhen  the  Ynnic  Empire  under  Emperor  Armynn  II  decided  to  build  a  new dam in\nDolindha,  they  had  first  chosen  Bostynn  to  host  it  due  to  its historical significance.\nHowever,  due  to an incident there, a new location downstream was chosen at what is now\nBosancovac.  Work  began  on  the  construction  of  the  Bosancovac Dam in 948 and was\nfinished by 956. The purpose of the new dam was primarily to act as a crossing from Sarda\nto  Dolindha  which  would  allow  easier  access for the Ynnic Empire’s troops to enter the\nregion. Over time, this new route would be called the Tromseloc Way."
 page_events.2753.t: "Temple of Bosancovac 3 / 6"
 page_events.2753.d: "\n\n===Founding of the Town===\nOnce  the dam was built, fishermen and merchants started building stilt houses and floating\nplatforms  around  the  reservoir.  Over  time  these  platforms grew and joined together to\nform  a  town  floating  on  the  water.  Situated  between Dolindha and Sarda, as well as a\ncrossing  point  of  the  Ynn,  the town was a natural location for merchants to peddle their\nwares.  The town was named Bosancovac, or the merchant’s bridge, after the large presence\nof merchants in the town.\n\nDue  to  the  numerous  dangers  of  the  Ynn, vessels on the river were an infrequent sight.\nHowever,  at  first  due  to necessity, the merchants of Bosancovac would conduct trade via\ngondolas  and  canoes.  After  some  success,  they  used the unique position of the town to\nlaunch voyages across the Ynn.\n\n===Third Ynnic Civil War===\nThe  War  of Three Emperors, or the Third Ynnic Civil War, starting in 1151 was the first\nmajor  conflict  near  Bosancovac.  Bosancovac managed to stay neutral in the war with the\nprotection  of  its fleet and its natural defense from being located atop the river, and so was\nthe  destination  of  many  people  seeking  shelter  from  the ravages of war. These arrivals\nquickly grew the population of the town and challenged the infrastructure keeping the town\nafloat.  After  the  war  ended  in  1205  with  the  dissolution  of  the  Ynnic  Empire,  the\nTromseloc  Way  had  been  completely  abandoned,  being  taken  over  by  wendigos  and\nVeykodan  tribes.  Without  the  protection  of  the Ynnic Empire’s troops, Bosancovac was\nitself  vulnerable  to those threats coming from the east. To protect itself, Bosancovac hired\nmercenaries  and  landless knights and trained them in fighting atop the water on gondolas.\nThese  troops were derisively named “Paddleboard Knights” by other Dolindhans, however\nthey proved very effective in protecting the floating town.\n\n===From Town to Temple===\nBosancovac  was  a  town ruled in tandem by its mayor and its river priests. The mayor was\nbacked  by the “Boat” faction made up of merchants and craftsmen and managed the town’s\nsecular  life.  The  priests meanwhile, managed the town’s spiritual life and were backed by\nthe  “River”  faction  who  were  opposed  to being ruled by a mayor and were supported by\nnoblemen.  In  1224,  the  River  faction  along  with  the Lordship of Amacimst and many\nPaddleboard Knights, opposed to the idea of a republic, enacted a coup and proclaimed the\nTemple of Bosancovac. They forced the mayor out of the town and confined them to live in\nImstana,  a  settlement  on  the  far  side  of  the  Ynn.  From then on, there was an annual\ncelebration  of the coup, marked by festivities and a parade and sponsored by the patricians\nof the town."
 page_events.2754.t: "Temple of Bosancovac 4 / 6"
 page_events.2754.d: "\n\nOnce  the  priests  succeeded  in  their  coup,  they established a theocracy and created The\nHoly  Merchant  Fleet  from  the assorted trading vessels of the Boat faction, becoming the\nonly  nation  of  the  Ynn with a presence on the water. The Holy Merchant Fleet was used\nfor  trading  and the movement of goods of course, but it also had the task of delivering the\npayments of crossing tolls when funeral barges passed through the dams.\n\n===New Business Partners===\nDue  to  the  mercantile  nature  of  the  inhabitants  of  Bosancovac,  there  grew  to  be  a\nstereotype  among  the  Ynnic  that the Bosancovaco people were greedy and untrustworthy.\nThis  came  to  a  head  in  1273  when  the  Scrolls  Against  Rea  Narsi were published, a\ncollection  of  complaints  by  various  alleged  customers  against  Rea  Narsi,  a merchant\nhailing  from  Bosancovac.  This caused the negative stereotype to grow and badly damaged\ntheir   business   prospects,   which  caused  the  Bosancovaco  to  act  more  honestly  and\nupstandingly  in  the  hopes  of  regaining  the  trust  of  the  other  Ynnics. Ultimately this\nreputation  led  to  Bosancovac being receptive to the Cannorians when they arrived as they\nhad  no  preconceptions  about  them.  In  1444  Bosancovac  aided  Vels Bacar during the\nTrompolerey conquest of Vels Bacar, seeking to improve their standing among the Ynnics.\n\nWhen  the  Cannorians  arrived  in  the  16th  century,  Bosancovac viewed them as a great\nopportunity. A whole array of new goods became available for the merchants of Bosancovac\nto   peddle  to  the  Ynn  as  the  Cannorians  didn’t  have  the  negative  preconceptions  of\nBosancovac  that  the  Dolindhans  had.  This  boom in commerce revitalized the town and\nstarted  new  industries.  The  processing  of  animal products into rope and oil became the\nnew  mainstay  of  Bosancovac,  with eventual production of bombs becoming an important\nexport  as well. The import of firearms helped advance the military of Bosancovac allowing\nit to maintain its independence.\n\nThe  arrival  of the Cannorians sparked tensions across the Ynn, with two factions forming,\nThe  Vodynnar  and  the  Polervit. Of which Bosancovac found itself among the Vodynnar,\nthe  faction  promoting progress and trade with the Cannorians, along with its close trading\npartner  of  Vels  Bacar.  Following  the  death  of  Lord Ultaran the Kind of Vels Bacar in\n1602, the War of the Bacaran Succession started, a deadly war of a scale not seen since the\ncollapse  of  the  Ynnic  Empire.  Bosancovac,  disconnected by land from Vels Bacar, sent\nwhat  help  they  could by gondola. The disconnection however also proved beneficial, as it\nmeant  Bosancovac  was  safe from invasion and Corinsfield in the east provided a buffer of\nprotection.  This  also made Bosancovac a safe haven for those fleeing from the war. In the\nend,  the  war  was  lost  in  1623  and  the Bacaran Republic was razed and split up by the\nvictors.  Bosancovac however ended the war in a better state than when it started, having its\npopulation grown once again from those seeking refuge."

This series\nof  wars  devastated Dolindha, with a significant amount of its population having either fled\nthe  region  or  died.  Bosancovac was a natural place for these refugees to flee to due to its\nnatural  protection  and  proximity. With that influx of population, as well as from the War\nof  the Bacaran Succession, Bosancovac grew to be the largest city of Dolindha. Leveraging\nits  large  population,  Bosancovac's manufacturing also grew significantly keeping the town\nprosperous despite its rapid growth.\n\nIn  the  latter  half  of  the  18th  century, there was a new arrival to the Ynn in the form of\nGnomes  from  the  Gnomish  Hierarchy.  Bosancovac  was  their first point of contact and\nbecame  host  to  the only Gnomish community of the Ynn. The gnomes grew interested in\nBosancovac’s  usage  of  clockwork  in  their  city  as well as their navy and the potential of\nmaking  a  vessel  worthy  of travel on, and underneath, the Ynn. By 1777 the gnomes with\nhelp  from  the locals created the Coddorran Class Submersible, a boat able to travel under\nthe  water of the Ynn and see what lay beneath. This proved to be a marvel as people would\nspend their life’s savings on a single trip to see what had never been seen before.\n\n===Decades of the Mountain===\nThe  invasion  of  the  Sarda  Empire by the Havoric Jahanon in 1788 marked the start of a\nperiod  of  Cannorian  rule  over the Ynn known as The Decades of the Mountain. Being a\nprosperous  city  surrounded  by  the expansionist powers of the Dragon Dominion and the\nnew  High  Havoral,  Bosancovac  was  in  a  tenuous  position. In an attempt to keep their\nindependence,  they  adopted  a  flexible diplomacy strategy to trade with and appease both\npowers.  In  addition, they played the two against each other in their attempts to control the\n“city of the Ynn’s desire”.\n\nBosancovac  managed  to  stave  off  invasion for 5 years, but over time the rivalry between\nHigh   Havoral   and   the   Dragon  Dominion  grew  large  enough  that  it  came  out  of\nBosancovac's  control.  In  1795, High Havoral declared war on Bosancovac as the start of\nwhat’s  known  as  the  War of the Three River-Banks or as the High Havorics called it, the\nWar  of  Ynnic  Reunification.  The  Siege  of the Floating City ended with High Havoral's\nforces successfully invading the city after a costly siege, but were trapped after their bridges\nwere  destroyed  by  water serpents. After two months of occupying the city, they eventually\nmanaged  to  extract their forces, and their king Jahanon, from Bosancovac after looting the\ncity.  Peace  was  reached  after  3 years in 1798 after the Dragon Dominion defeated High\nHavoral.  As  part  of  the  terms  for  peace,  Bosancovac’s  independence was maintained,\ncementing it in the new political landscape after the war."

 page_events.1421.t: "Thanas Circuit 1 / 4"
 page_events.1421.d: "\nThe  Thanas Circuit is a series of races which began in the rural region of Thanas, a sleepy\ncorner  of  Ibevar  known  only for its agricultural production. Held as a yearly festival, the\nCircuit  can be broken into a double meaning, referring to both the modern circuit races of\nmotorcarts around a set track, and the "circuit" that spectators take between the viewing of\nmodern races and the traditional and artificed Thanas Cart racing. The latter two consist of\na   series   of   downhill  races,  the  contemporary  version  being  distinguished  from  the\ntraditional  by  the presence of any safety features or control mechanisms on the carts. Still\none  of the greatest tourist attractions in the otherwise serene elfrealm, the Thanas Circuit's\nraces are spectacle enough to give an elf all the excitement they would need for the year.\n\n== History of Cartracing ==\n\n=== Origins ===\nTraditional  introduced  by  the  apprentices  of  the local chapter of Ibevar's Avusíllerní or\nCartwrights'  Guild,  who  took  to  racing  newly  minted carts as a test of their durability.\nParticipants  would  initially  use  sturdy  horses  such as the Cursewood draft to draw their\ncarts up to the top of tall hills, unhook them, and "pilot" the uncontrolled cart in a race to\nthe  bottom,  the  one  who  was  able  to  get  the  most  distance  from  it  typically  being\nconsidered  the  winner.  While  originally a sport among the apprentices of the Avusíllerní\nand a mere by-product of cartwrights' craft, soon enough, the practice grew popular enough\nfor  specific Thanas Carts to be commissioned. However, due to the danger of racing heavy\ncarts  downhill  with  no  method  of  steering  or  braking,  the  sport was infamous for the\nnumerous fatalities amongst pilots and spectators alike, giving it a rather dismal reputation,\ncondemning it to be seen as the sport of the region's uncouth rural folk. Originally held on\nany  sloped  roadway  in  the  region  of Thanas, the practice was quickly limited to specific\nstretches  of closed or specially constructed roadway that would not send the carts barreling\ninto unfortunate pedestrians or residential areas.\n\n=== Artificery and the modern Thanas Cart ===\nThe  man  responsible  for  the  spread of the sport to the rest of Ibevar and beyond was an\nartificer  named Munas Avusíllern, who manufactured a prototype cart made of metal, with\na  functioning  steering  wheel  and  braking  device.  He  used his creation in order to win\nseveral  local races, showing the potential that the Thanas Carts had. He used the proceeds\nfrom  his  victories  and  the support of the local organizers in order to create larger events,\nattracting  wider audiences, and creating the initial rift between the traditional and artificed\nThanas Cart. Many practitioners, even to this day, consider the plain un-controlled wooden\ncarts  of  days  past  the  only "pure" form of racing. Avusíllern was notably inspired by the\nsmall  population of goblin refugees that had been resettled in Thanas at around the time of\nthe  Ibevari  reformation,  creating  a small but thriving community of artificers that helped\nIbevar  to  maintain  its  status  as  a Cannorian innovator, despite the lagging pace of other\nelfrealms."
 page_events.2757.t: "Thanas Circuit 2 / 4"
 page_events.2757.d: "\n\n=== Carts across Cannor ===\nThanas-Cart  racing  would  evolve  into  a  professionalized  sport  in  the  years  after  the\nartificed  cart's  introduction.  First spreading to the trendsetting Núrael, and then to other\nlocales  throughout  the  Elfrealm, the excitement of the downhill races grew in exponential\npopularity,  especially  with  the severe decline in one's risk of being flattened by a toppling\ncart  that  had  turned  off  course.  Beyond  Ibevar,  professional  teams  sprung up first in\nGiberd  and Telgeir, and soon spread all across Cannor. Few could resist the "Thrill of the\nHill"  as the spectacle of carts barreling down the hill at speeds faster than a horse's gallop,\nalong  with bloody, often deadly wrecks even despite the safety measures implemented drew\nthe  attention of an uncouth public hungry for the drama of it all. Horse races could hardly\ncompete with the spectacle, elevated by the sensational commentary of the Tellumite Criers\nwho  to  this  day  maintain  a  running  narrative  of all three forms of the sport. The early\nThanas  Circuit,  which  invited participants from all across Cannor, is noted for being one\nof  the  most successful forces in the easing of Ibevar's strict regulations on outside visitors,\na  tradition  maintained  since  the  time  of the White Pestilence, opening the nation up to\nhumans  and  the  other races of Cannor. While prevalent in early years, the use of potions\nand  unsanctioned  spellcraft  has  been  forbidden  in all races despite their prominence in\nearly  years  as  the  Circuit  has become the domain of artificers and renowned for pushing\nthe  limits  of  automotive  design,  and  the classic races the domain of purists who disdain\neven  the  idea  of  safety harnesses or personal warding that would minimize the tragedy of\ncollisions and crashes.\n\n=== Thanas Car ===\nDespite  his  heavy  battle-scars  from centuries of cart racing, Munas Avusíllern would not\nonly miraculously survive a number of crashes and collisions that far outpaces his years but\nagain  transform  the  sport.  Following one of his "missionary" trips to spread the thrill of\nthe Thanas Cart across the world, he became aware of the Taychendi motorcart. Captivated\nby a device that could take all the thrill of a downhill rush under its own propulsion, across\nany  road or path in Halann, Avusíllern was one of the earliest adopters of the motorcart in\nCannor,  establishing  the  Thanas  Circuit  races, and establishing the Lungráilt Motorcart\nCompany,  which  has  cemented  itself  as  the  maker  of  some of Cannor's most coveted\nmotorcarts.  The  incontestable  patience  of elfkind has produced the length of the modern\nThanas-style  Car  Races,  wherein  cars  are expected to make hundreds of laps around the\ncircuit  track,  requiring  the  frequent exchanges of wheels and other parts due to the strain\nthat the high speeds and specialized modifications put on the components of the motorcarts\nparticipating."

 page_events.2758.d: "\n\n== The Circuit's Races ==\nAll  three  forms  of  Thanas  Cart Racing are still practiced on a yearly basis at the Thanas\nCircuit,  where  enthusiasts  for  various  methods  of  Cannorian  transport meet and swap\nstories,  carts,  and  memorabilia  commemorating  the  long  and  storied history of Carts,\nCarriages, and Motorcarts.\n\n=== Traditional Thanas Cartracing ===\nThe  traditional  Thanas Cart is a contraption made of wood and four wheels, placed lower\nto  the  ground  than  a  normal  cart or wagon would be, the original Carts, alongside their\nmodern replicas, (or those few enough lucky to survive decades or centuries of use) feature\nno steering device or brakes. The traditional Thanas Cart is "piloted" by a single soul, and\npushed to the point where it will roll downhill by the rest of their three-man team, who can\nhop  into  the cart or not at their leisure. Competing schools of thought exist on whether to\nuse  the  full  team's  weight  to sway the cart, or to pray to Ara and let a single pilot see the\nrace through.\n\n=== Artificed Thanas Cartracing ===\nSomewhat  unloved  in  recent  years,  Artificed Cartracing is the middle child between the\ntraditional  and  modern,  its  safety  features  scorned  by traditionalists, as the limit of the\ndownhill  run  turns  the noses of Motorcart fans. Typically, a single driver uses the limited\npower  of  the  cart's  engine  to  give it the first push, steering through a much longer track\nfollowing  the  downhill  slope.  Cars  are expected to traverse the two or three miles to the\nfinish  after  the hill, jockeying for a lead in the way one would expect in modern motorcart\nracing.  The  craft  in  these  races  still  conform to the basic shape of the cart, and certain\nregulations  keep  the  designs from veering too close to the motorcart's more aerodynamic\ndesigns.  Often,  the sport is mocked for the fact that many carts regularly fail to make it to\nthe finish line, leading to many centuries-overused jokes about under-performance.\n\n=== Thanas Motorcart Racing ==="

 page_events.1422.d: "\nNOTE:  THIS  PAGE  IS  OLD,  IT NEEDS TO BE UPDATED WITH THE LORE IN\nTHE DECADES OF DEVASTATION PAGE\n\n\nThe Baharkandi-Birsartanšesi War took place during the Decades of Devastation in Bahar,\nit started in 1419 (over the Baharkandi intervention in the Re'uyeli civil war) and ended in\n1423 when both parties were forced to abandon the war thanks to human rebellions.\n\n==Overview==\nThe  war  is  often divided in three portions depending on which of the two elven countries\nhad  the  upperhand, sometimes the mid portion is split up into the Baharkande reconquest\nof  their  country  and  Kaltan  III's  failed  invasion  of  Birsartanšes. There are also some\nscholars who see the following human rebellions as its own portion of this war.\n\nThe  war saw many grave battles, whilst the amount of elvish knights and human auxiliaries\ndidn't  matched  those  of  the Lilac Wars both sides made use of mages and sky platforms.\n(Bulwars  infamous  flying  chariot-like  vehicles  piloted by a mage, carrying two others to\nreign  death from above.) The local population commonly referred to it as 'a great time for\nvultures and undertakers'.\n\n==First part (1419)==\nThe  first  part started with Birsartanšes routing border forces and occupying huge swatches\nof  Baharkand. They could achieve this as Baharkand's best troops were fighting in Re'uyel\nto place Kaltan's wife on the throne.\nIn  the  summer  the  Birsartanšesi  army,  led  by  king  Arantir himself, started sieging the\nBaharkandi capital of Aqatbar, after having encircled it by land and blockaded by sea.\n\n==Second part (1419-1422)==\nAround  the same time king Kaltan III had succeeded in taking over Re'uyel (or at least for\na while as his wife, Seluzia, soon lost her new kingdom to rebels) and returned to expel the\nBirsartanšesi out of his country."

 page_events.2760.d: "\nThe  army  returning  from  Re'uyel  attacked the besieging forces whilst the garrison of the\ncapital  used  the opportunity to launch raiding sorties at the enemy. The heirs of Bisarthan\nwere routed, allowing the Baharkandi forces to start with the reconquest of their homeland.\n\nThen  when  the  Crathanori  Secession  War  happened  Kaltan  could  afford  to  strip his\nwestern  border  of  its  garrisons  without  fearing  an  invasion and thought he had enough\ntroops  to  risk  bringing  the  fight  to  his  opponent.  At  the start of his counter-invasion\nBaharkand  was  making great gains but he outran his supply lines and his armies ended up\nrouted at the battle of Habqez.\n\n==Third part (1422-1423)==\nWhit  both  parties  having  failed in their invasions the war began to turn into a stalemate,\nwith  bloody  indecisive  battles  at  the  borders.  Soon  both  parties  were  running out of\nmanpower.  The  kingdoms  then  started to open new sources of manpower, first by hiring\ngoblin  mercenaries  from the north and supplying them with arms, later by drafting human\ncommoners into their armies. Both turned out to be mistakes, the first later as those goblin\nmercenaries  ended  up  providing  valuable  information about local warfare and terrain to\ntheir  invading  kin,  the  second  immediately as the human population decided that if they\nhave  to  fight  they might just as well fight for themselves, instead of their elvish overlords,\nand revolted, inspired by the revolution in Re'uyel.\n\n==The human rebellions (1423-1424)==\nThe  elvish  powers  called a truce so they could bring their full strength to bear against the\nrebels.  As  the  elves  were  a  much  larger  minority  in  East Bahar then in Re'uyel, they\nmanaged  to  stem the tide and managed to suppress the uprisings in their capitals. Though\nactually  reconquering  the  outlying  rebel territories proved a more difficult task, not only\nbecause  of  the terrain the rebels also had already organized themselves and were joined by\ndisillusioned ex-officers.\nThere  were  various  things  which  worked  in  the  rebels  favor  such  as  help  from  the\nmysterious  underground  mage  schools of Bulwar. (They were a product of Sun elf policy\nof   only   allowing  select  few  human  mages  access  to  magical  education,  forcing  any\nuntalented  or  'unreliable'  human  magic  users  to instead go underground if they want to\nreach  their  full  potential,  whilst  these  underground  schools  hadn't the same quality its\nstudent  graduate  corps hadn't just been decimated by war.) The rebels also found a way to\nambush  the  'sky platforms', they would shoot at a lone one scouting with a pair of hidden\nballistas  then  when  the platform responds with strafing them it would be shot at from the\nflanks  with  two other ballistas, whose bolts where guided by a wind mage. (This normally\nled  more  to  destroyed  ballistas  then platforms, but the humans could afford these losses\nwhilst the elves didn't.)"

Considered by historians and scholars alike to\nmark  the  end  of  the Chivalric Era in Escann, and the beginning of the renaissance era in\nCannor.  This  battle was the first major defeat for the Greentide Vanguard since emerging\nfrom  the  Serpentspine,  and  marked  their  decline.  The  fracturing of the Marcher Lord\namries  at  the  end  of the battle also marked the beginning of the Second Escanni Warlord\nPeriod.\n\n== Leading up to the Battle ==\n\n=== Greentide Accounts ===\nAccording  to  Varok  Bladebreaker's  account,  the  Greentide  found itself in a precarious\nsituation.  Up until 1443, the chiefs and commanders had relied on continuous looting and\nconquering  of  new  lands  to  maintain momentum and cohesion. This strategy demanded\nthem  to  remain  constantly  on  the  offensive.  Alongside  this, Korgus Dookanson's holy\nmission  to  avenge  Dookan left them desperate for new territories to invade. Despite their\nefforts,  Korgus  and  his commanders had been unsuccessful in breaking out of Escann and\npenetrating western Cannor through Corvuria, Farranéan, and Ibevar.\n\nTheir  progress  had  been impeded by the formidable fortifications of Bal Dostan, coupled\nwith  the  devastating  nighttime  raids carried out by the Black Knights of Corvuria. These\nfactors  alone  halted  their  advance  completely  and  rendered committing to a prolonged\nsiege unfeasible."

While the orcs eventually overcame the\nmajority of the Farrani forces, this victory left them weakened, making a full-scale invasion\nof  the  well-prepared and disciplined Elfrealm of Ibevar unwise. The thought of advancing\ninto  a  heavily  fortified  and  meticulously  organised  elfrealm,  with the knowledge of its\nformidable elven defenders, did not instil confidence in Korgus or his commanders.\n\nThe  only  viable  option  remaining  was  to  traverse  the unfortified and loosely patrolled\nborders  of  Gawed.  By tracing the course of the Oudcesker riverbed, they could penetrate\ndirectly into the heart of Gawed. Korgus issued the command to advance into the county of\nMossford,  passing  through  the  mires  of  Rottenstep  to bypass the Gawedi stronghold in\nGardfort.  Subsequently,  they would find themselves swiftly crossing the open plains of the\nAlenic Expanse, leaving the core territories of Gawed exposed and undefended.\n\n== The Prelude to Battle ==\nFacing  a deluge of pleas for aid and an influx of refugees at his borders, Crwon Prince Jon\nof  Gawed,  grappled  with  a  weighty  decision.  His  father  was  sickly but still alive and\nGawed  could  not  afford  to  deploying  the full might of their military resources until the\norcs  were  within Gawed, when it would be to late. Even without this internal turmoil, the\nproximity  of  the  Lilac  Wars,  along  with  the  looming  spectre  of a Lorentish invasion,\nrendered  it  politically  unfeasible  to  muster  the  forces  of Gawed against the Greentide\npreemptively.  Despite  these  challenges,  Prince  Jon was determined not to abandon their\neastern  brethren  to  defenselessness.  To  this  end, he invested a substantial portion of his\nfamily's personal wealth to assemble an independent force of volunteers and mercenaries.\n\nThe initial response materialised through his close friend, Ricard I Silcalas, the Marquis of\nArbaran,  as  chronicled  by  Dustin  Smallknight,  an  adviser  to  the Arbarani court. The\nMarquis,  in agreement with his friend's assessment, acknowledged the dire threat posed by\nthe Greentide. Aligned with his personal friendship with Prince Jon and in accordance with\nhis  ancestral  duty  as  Marquis  of the North, Ricard committed to supporting the Gawedi\nPrince  and  defending  the Empire preemptively, even if other lords of the Empire failed to\nrecognize the peril."

They  pledged  to  provide  arms,  equipment, and payment to all willing\nsoldiers  who  heeded  the  summons  to safeguard Western Cannor, to later march towards\nthe province of Mossford.\n\nAs the Lords gathered at Mossford, the Marquis of Arbaran summoned Dustin Smallknight\nto  his tent and instructed him and his retainers to begin the process of assessing the terrain\nand,  if  possible, ascertaining the disposition of the Orcish horde, which was still amassing\nin force.\n\nSmallknight  and  his pioneers swiftly determined that the only viable crossing point for the\nOrcish horde into Gawed, given its immense size, was a dry, muddy riverbed known by the\nlocal  Balmirish  as  the  'Rottenstep'.  This  name derived from the west bank of the river,\nwhich  was  lined  with  rotted  old  fallen  trees, resembling a staircase ascending from the\nriverbed.  This  topography  made  it  the  most  accessible  point for the orcs to launch an\nattack, precisely why Smallknight chose this ground for the battle.\n\nWorking   alongside   his   technical   advisor  and  pioneer  Pondo  Fussbolt,  Smallknight\npromptly  realised  that due to the density of trees on both sides of the Cannorian position,\nthe  area  was effectively un-flankable. Additionally, the position offered excellent visibility\nof the orcish encampment, allowing the Cannorians to track any potential orc movement.\n\nThe  plan  was  straightforward,  yet  required  extensive  preparation. Small raiding parties\nwould be dispatched to harass the orcs, providing cover for the preparation of the riverbed.\nStakes  were  embedded  in  the  soft  mud of the river, and small pots were buried as well.\nFurthermore,  to facilitate the ranged capabilities brought by the Cannorians, earth mounds\nand makeshift scaffolds were erected. These structures enabled Damerian longbowmen and\nDwarven gunners to fire over the heads of the soldiers in the wall."

In addition to this, the gnomes were\nordered  to  construct  a  small  series  of  wooden structures. When locked together, these\nstructures would form a small makeshift portable bridge that would enable swift crossing of\nmounted soldiers. This was in preparation for deploying the Cannorian cavalry to the other\nbank, should they be needed, or a tactically useful opportunity arose.\n\nIf all went according to plan, the orcs would be lured towards the ditch and the shield wall,\nwhere  they  would  be  halted  and suffer significant losses under the barrage of Cannorian\narrows, bolts, and bullets.\n\n=== First Contact ===\nThe  battle  commenced  with  a  few  small  skirmishes between goblin, halfling & gnome\nscouting  parties.  The  first death in the battle occurred when Aadga Venomtooth fired the\nfirst  arrows  at  the  scouting party from the Cobalt Company. The orcs then proceeded to\ngroup on the east bank of the dried river. According to the account of Varok Bladebreaker,\nKorgus  was  unusually  apprehensive  to  commit  to  battle  due  to  the obvious defensive\npreparations  made by the Cannorians. However, he was convinced by the shamans that the\nomens were good and Dookan would support the orcs in battle and resolved to attack.\n\nKorgus however, realised that he would not be able to simply smash aside this hostile army\nbefore  him,  as  well  entrenched as they were. Thus he bade his commanders to order the\norcs  forward,  as  per  unusual,  and  at an appropriate time, he would feign retreat. At the\nsame  time  as this, he commanded his shamans, lead by Grama Clouded Eye to perform a\nmagical  ritual,  to  further  entice  the Cannorians to give chase as they were "fleeing" and\nfeigning   defeat.   Knowing   the   Cannorian   tendency   to  underestimate  enemies  they\nconsidered  inferior,  he  hoped this would make the Cannorians break their defensive lines\nof their own accord."

However,  due  to  the  moist condition of the\nrottenstep and the armour of the Cannorians, this proved remarkably ineffective, as did the\nreturn  fire  from  the  Cannorians  firing  into  wind.  So, they resorted to their traditional\ntactics and charged into the Marcher lines.\n\nAccounts  from  soldiers  on the ground suggest that the winds changed direction in front of\ntheir  very  eyes  as  they  were  about  to fire, attributing this to orcish magic performed by\ntheir  shamans.  There  are  however  limited  sources  from the orcish side of the battle to\ncorroborate this claim.\n\n== The Battle of Rottenstep ==\n\n=== The Charge of the Orcs ===\nSweltering  in  their  suits  of  armour,  the  Marchers  braced  themselves with their pikes,\nspears,  and  halberds.  Most  of their forces were on foot, and the small amount of cavalry\nthey  had available was held back, with the orcs having no cavalry at all, dismounting at the\nbehest  of Korgus, due to the tactical disposition of the Cannorians rendering the cavalry of\nthe orcs ineffective.\n\nThe  orc charge was severely impeded by the marshy terrain, the waterlogged river, and the\ndefences that had been hastily erected by the Marchers according to Smallknights plan.\n\nWhilst  dislocated, and staggered, the momentum of the charge was still yet formidable and\nas the first wave of orcs slammed into the shield wall; the melee began in earnest. The orcs\nhammered  onto  the  shields with their vicious weapons but despite the ferocity and vigour\nof  the  orcish  assault,  the  line  held, and the orcs died in droves, just as the Marcher war\ncouncil  had  envisaged  and  as  Dustin  Smallknight  predicted.  The orcish commanders,\nunphased  by  this,  continued  to  order their soldiers to charge across the ditch of death in\naccordance  with  the  Plan  of  Korgus.  Though shields broke, and some Cannorians were\npulled or slipped into the riverbed, to be hacked to death, the line held."

This was the\nmoment  when  Korgus  Dookanson  himself  decided  to  execute  his  plan.  He had been\nsurprised  by  the  ferocity of the Cannorian defenders and he realised that he must now try\nto  spring his trap before his losses outweighed the potential victory. He swiftly ordered his\nmen to withdraw, feigning retreat, whilst his shamans prepared to enact Korgus’ plan.\n\n=== The Trap ===\nThe  Aldresians,  being  ironically  enough  the least battle hardened of the Marchers, were\nbefuddled  by  a  most  powerful enchantment. Typically, they would have woven protective\nwards  and  readied themselves against magical onslaughts. These wards proved inadequate,\npartly  owing  to  the  Aldresians  and  novice mages struggling to muster sufficient magical\npower,  and partly due to the overwhelming might of the assembled orcish shamans, casting\nas one.\n\nUnder  the command of suggestive magics, some Aldresian warriors became convinced that\nthe  orcs  were  now  in  full  retreat,  broke from the line and charged across the river with\nshouts  of  victory.  Others  swiftly  followed  either  confused  with what was happening on\nbeing  caught  up  in the enthusiastic exuberance of the charge. This was the moment when\nthe battle for Cannorians started to go wrong.\n\nOnly  very  few  Knights were befouled by the magics, twelves succumbing to the spell, but\nthat  was  all  that  was  needed.  Convinced  by  the  magics  that the orcs were now in full\nretreat,  the  Aldresians  charged  across  the  river  and  after  the  orcs,  which  they  were\nconvinced were routing. Exactly as Korgus had predicted.\n\nThe  lightly armoured orcs unencumbered by comparison to the Aldresians' turned quickly,\nand  with devastating counter charge slammed into and pass the chasing Aldresians bowling\nmany  unfooted  knights  over into the sodden muck. Worst of all, now that the Alderdsian\nhad  broken  formation,  the  orcs  in  the  their  multitudes  poured  past  the now isolated\nAldresian  and  stormed  up  the  banks  of  the  river,  and within seconds were behind the\nCannorian wall."

No  sooner  had  he  been  abandoned  by  his  men  he was swarmed by orcs, and\nthough he killed many, he was inevitably felled.\n\nRogier  Silmuna,  horrified by the sudden and dramatic reversal of fortunes, Rogier showed\nhimself  to  be  a  great  and  inspiring  leader;  truly  worthy  of  the  Silmuna  name.

Though its founding would be many years off, many\nscholars consider this battle the spiritual founding date of the Kingdom of Rogieria.\n\nKraig  Balgarsblood, from his position in the centre left of the line, was near the Aldresians\nwhen   the   fateful   charge   broke   away   from  the  line.  Initially  dumbfounded  at  the\nincompetence  of the Aldresian humans inability to ‘stand in a straight line, he decided that\nit  would  be  better  to  attempt  to  assist  them  than  to try to hold a line that had clearly\nalready  failed.  Thus,  swinging his battle hammer high in the air he bellowed to fellows to\nfollow  the Aldersians.

It  was  during  this  action  that  Winston  Foolfoot would save\nSmallknight's  life,  toppling  a huge orc warrior to the ground with a mighty blow from his\nmace, shattering the orc's kneecap.

Korgus'  Vanguard  however,  was  still  in  the  fields and met the cavalry with a\nbrace.  Many  knights  after  the initial impact were pulled from their horses, including the\nPrince  Jon who was beheaded by Korgus Dookanson himself soon after. The family sword\nof  Gawed,  Talon,  was  lost  in  this  melee.  The Bennon Brothers smashed into the orcs\nsecond.

The once dry riverbed now ran free again, but with the blood of orcs,\nhumans,   halflings,   dwarfs,   goblins,   elves,   half-elves  and  gnomes.

The Bloodscrawl quickly conquer Tuwad-Dhûmankon\nin  the  first  surprise  attack,  beginning  a  series  of brutal wars to attempt to conquer the\ncountless layers of Grônstunad from the hobgoblin clans.\n\nFor  a  time  the  Bloodscrawl are successful, Kringar declaring himself Jade Emperor from\nthe  old  throne of the dwarves, Grônstunad, in 119. However, the unity of the goblins did\nnot  outlive  Kringar  and  they descended to infighting for a decade, by 182 the hobgoblins\nhad  expelled  the  Undergrowth  Goblins  and  enslaved  the majority of the Blackstep and\nStolen  Gem  goblins  that  had chosen to side with their western cousins. Using the power\nvacuum left in the defeat of the Bloodscrawl, the hobgoblins would decieve the Stolen Gem\nand  Blackstep  clans  to  fight eachother, creating temporary alliances to slowly deplete the\nstrength  of  both  groups  to  weaken  them,  allowing the hobgoblin Stone Panther clan to\ncapture Verkal Dromak in the mid 200s.\n\n=== The Great Mage Crisis ===\nIn  the  aftermath  of  the  Godloss, sometime between the 440s-580s, some mages tried to\nrestore  their  influence.  Attempting  to  unite  tribes  through  shows  of force and gaining\nincredible power from the dark knowledge of the oni, an uneasy alliance of powerful mages\nleads a huge invasion of Shamakhad, catching the Raheni off-guard. With the armies of the\nHarimraja  attempting  to  reconquer  Lianzhou  in  the  east,  the  Great  Hobgoblin Army\nrampages  south  and  are  eventually  stopped  at.  They  are  forced  to  fall  back  due  to\nrebellions and attacks from anti-mage hobgoblins in the rear resisting their influence. Need\nto  respond  to  this  shatters  the unity of the mage coalition, and the following decades are\nefforts  to  track  down  and  kill  the high mages hiding in the strongholds. Mages become\nincreasingly  oppressed  during  this  time  because of anti-magic sentiment that grew in the\npopulation"

This would fragment into\nmultiple  hobgoblin  clans over the next century, and would be swept away and destroyed or\nforced to flee to the Jade Mines when the Orcish incursions of the 800s began.\n\n=== Surface Wars ===\nFrom  the  950s-1100  there  hobgoblins  wage  a  series  of wars against the major surface\nkingdom  in  Ghatasak,  who  had attempted to seize the Jade Mines Foothills and even the\nhold of Grônstunad. Beleaguered from the wars against the orcs, the hobgoblins remain on\nthe  defensive.  Ultimately  these  would  end  when  Jaher  crushes  the Shamakhadi in his\ncampaigns,  ending  the wars but also pushing the hobgoblins out of the valleys and into the\nmountains.\n\n=== The Commands ===\nBetween 1136-1200 came the emergence of the Command system, a complete upending of\nthe   old   social   system  in  favor  of  a  new  purely  stratocratic  system.  Drawing  from\nexperiences  with  the  mage  crisis,  threatening  orcish  migrations  in  the  caves,  and the\nJaherian  Empire,  it  was  concluded  that military strength is the only thing that mattered.\nThey decided that in order to resist the threats that constantly seemed to crash down on the\nhobgoblins,  they  must  take  the  observations  of the Way of the Godlost to the inevitable\nconclusion - unity by strength, unity by family, unity by discipline, and unity by order.\n\nIt  would  be  in  the  1300s  that  the various tribes would become various commands, and\nthose  various commands would become 3 major commands, the Lion, Boar, and Wolf. In\n1392  it  was  decided  amongst  these  three  commands  to  confederate  under The Great\nCommand,  to  stop killing each other and start fighting alongside each other, leading them\nto  the  1431  invasion  of  Shamakhad by their second and new Grand Marshal, Moguwon\nWolfborn."

While  official  hostilities  would span over a decade, any active fighting between the\ntwo  clans  would  only occur during the first few years. After which, the elves would spend\ntheir energy surviving against orcish and goblin incursions.\n\nThe  consequences  of  war  and  its  aftermath would prove extremely costly for both salla.\nSalla  Cenág  would  lose  their ''Ceann'', a large portion of its army, and half its territory.\nSalla  Drennen  would  also  lose its ''Ceann'' and much of its forces while its lands would\nravaged  by  repeated  invasions  from elven, orcish, then goblin attackers. By the conflict's\nend, both clans were driven to near destruction.\n\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn 1428, Arun Drennen, a powerful Wood Elf mage who had spent much of his life finding\na  way  to  tear  the Verdant Veil down, made a breakthrough discovery about the origins of\nthe  Veil  with  his  grand nephew and apprentice Eledas Cenág. The two then attempted to\ncapitalize  on  this knowledge, the result was a disaster. Eledas was killed and Arun was left\namnesiac. When Eledas' broken body was found amongst the remnants of Arun's spell, the\nelder  Drennen  elf  was  arrested.  Arun's  inability  to  explain  Eledas'  death to Belarion\nCenág, Ceann of Salla Cenág and Eledas’ older brother, resulted the swift condemnation of\nArun  as  a kinslayer, the gravest of crimes in Salla Cenág. The mage was then sentenced to\nexecution.\n\nArun,  however,  was  unwilling  to  let  his  work  and  the  truth  of  what happened to his\napprentice  die  with  him.  He  used his magic to escape and fleeing back to his birth clan,\nSalla  Drennen.  There he was given refuge by his nephew and leader of the Drennen elves,\nCeladil  Drennen.  Furious  for  taking  in  Arun,  Belarion led Salla Cenág to attack Salla\nDrennen."

This would\nchange  when  a  centrally  organized  Cenága  army  was  raised,  after  several  months  of\nconflict.  The  extreme  action  would  take  the  Drennen  elves  by  surprise  resulting  in\nBelarion  Cenág  and  his  forces  sweeping  into Drennen territory. Forced to respond like\nwith like, Celadil Drennen began to muster his elves in similar fashion.\n\nIt  was at this time, in 1430, that the first wave of the Greentide had found passage into the\nThorn Grove thanks to local Bloody Tusk orcs leading the way. The orcs soon encountered\na  portion  of  Salla  Drennen’s army, still rallying to fight Salla Cenág. Having caught a foe\nunprepared,  the  orcs  charged  in. The result was a crushing victory over the elves of Salla\nDrennen with the vast majority being killed in battle. By chance misfortune, amongst those\nslain  were Celadil Drennen and his consort. By equal chance, Arun Drennen was amongst\none of the few scattered survivors of the battle.\n\nUnable to bear the guilt of being the cause of death for both his nephew, his grand nephew,\nand  countless other elves, Arun used the opportunity to disappear and be considered dead.\nIn  doing  this,  he  hoped  to  end  the war and give him time to find the truth of what had\nhappened with Eledas.\n\n=== Fey Intervention ===\nMeanwhile,  with  the  death  of  her  parents,  Narawen  Drennen became Ceanna of Salla\nDrennen  just  a  few  years  short  of  her twentieth birth date. With her clan in chaos and\nbarely  more  than a child, she called out to the Fey for aid. Thanks to her powerful magic,\nshe  attracted the attention of a trickster fey. After winning a game of riddles, the fey agreed\nto  help. This aid would come in the form of the orcs of the newly formed clan Sapchopper\nbeing  tricked  into  marching  into  the  invading Cenága elves. The battle would would be\nequal  parts  chaotic  and  bloody  for  both  sides,  only  ending when a mist caused by the\ntrickster   fey   washed   over   the   battlefield.  With  the  mist  dissipated,  the  orcs  had\ndisappeared, lost in the Feyrealm where they wouldn't be seen again for over a decade."

By  the  time  of  Cenága  elf  retreat,  Oubblig  had  largely  completed  his\nconquests  and  had  begun  to  look  for  new  opportunities. Thus, when he learned of the\ngeneral elven weakness, he was quick to rally his already prepared forces to attack.\n\nUsing his connections through his pact, Oubblig intercepted Belarion Cenág and his forces\nas  they  entered the Bone Grove. Caught in disadvantageous terrain, the already exhausted\nand  weakened  Cenága  forces  were  crushed,  facing numerous causalities. Chief amongst\nthem  was  Belarion himself. What elves survived were thanks to a bold charge through the\ngoblin  line  lead  by  the  fallen  Ceann's  sister Alara Cenág. Returning to the capital, the\nnewly  anointed  ''Cenna''  would  lead  a  dogged resistance against the goblins, ultimately\nstaving off defeat. As a result, Oubblig would then turn on Salla Drennen and later attempt\nhis disastrous invasion of the River Grove.\n\n=== Cold Conflict and Peace ===\nBy  1432,  any active fighting between Salla Cenág and Salla Drennen had ended with both\nsides   dealing  with  goblin  attacks.  For  all  intents  and  purpose,  the  war  had  ended.\nNevertheless,  any  overtures  of peace by Narawen Drennen were rejected by Alara Cenág,\nwho  cited  that  blood price for Arun's treachery had yet to be paid. Even after the news of\nArun  Drennen's alleged death became widely known, only an unofficial end of the conflict\nwas  accepted  by  the  Cenága elves, as the hurt and cost of the war was still believed to be\nunpaid  for.

Harpies  see  the act of hunting as the pursuit of one's objective, which could be\nsomething physical like mates or riches, or more philosophical, like knowledge.\n\nWhile the Hunt doesn’t have any form of clergy, each flock has a Songster, whose duty is to\nremember   the  songs,  sing  in  festivities  and  pass  down  their  knowledge  to  the  next\ngeneration.

The Orcish path and the\ntheir conflicts with the Dwarven holds will be mentioned in this period.\n\n=== Ducaniel's Campaign ===\nDespite  being created in 6000 BA by Ducaniel, it wouldn't be for another 2 years, in 5998\nBA, that the first orcish horde would be spotted outside of Verkal Kozenad. With Kozenad\nfacing  destruction  at  the  hands  of the orcs, its king, Mufnir VII, surrenders to Ducaniel\nand promises to support him with supplies.\n\nMoving  on  to  Er-Natvir,  Ducaniel  marches  on  it  from  both the western and southern\nentrances   in  the  year  5990  BA.  In  response  to  this  threat,  Marrhold  collapses  the\nEscanni-Dwarovar  tunnel  to  save  themselves,  cutting them off from the Serpentspine for\nthousands of years. Meanwhile, an orcish party had headed through the eastern tunnels and\nblocked  Er-Natvir's  northern  gate, completely isolating them. As orcish forces worked to\nset  up  an encampment by the southern gate, King Mufnir betrays Ducaniel and launches a\nsurprise  attack  on  the  pre-occupied orcs. Initially winning due to the shock factor of the\ndwarven  forces,  it  wouldn't  be  long  until  the  vastly  superior  orcish  numbers  would\noverwhelm the Opal Dwarves and crush them.\n\nPreoccupied with dwarven skirmishes and the logistics of the campaign, orcish forces face a\n20  year  stagnation.  With  the  rest  of  the  campaign  planned, Ducaniel, furious at King\nMufnir's  betrayal, is able to send a large host of orcs to wipe out the Opal Dwarf remnants\nin  Verkal  Kozenad  in  5970 BA. To ensure he would not be caught without a rally point,\nDucaniel  was  first  forced  to finish sieging Er-Natvir before being able to progress on his\nroute.  It wouldn't be until another 36 years, in 5934 BA, that the starving and ill-prepared\nforces   of   Er-Natvir   would   fall,  allowing  Ducaniel  to  split  his  forces  between  the\nDwarovrod and Daginrod.\n"

With this knowledge, Ducaniel leaves a moderate force of\norcs  to  siege  Mithradhûm  in 5925 BA, enough to prevent them from interfering with his\nimminent  attack  on Amldihr but not enough to seize the hold. His Daginrod forces would\nmarch through the Amloz tunnel 5 years later in 5920 BA to besiege the Hall of Ancestors,\nas the Dwarovrod forces march through the Amlvaz tunnel to besiege Verkal Vazkron.\n\n=== War for the King's Rock ===\nKnowing Amldihr wouldn't fall to a traditional siege, due it being fed by the Serpent's Vale\nand  abundant  access  to  reinforcements  from both Oralazam-az-dhir and Krakdhûmvror,\nDucaniel  spends  the  next two years devising a strategy to ensure victory. By 5918 BA the\nplan was prepared and Ducaniel sent a large host of orcs along the Dwarovrod and its caves\nalong  the  eastern  side to find a natural exit, unable to locate one they begin to make their\nown.  Another  orcish  host  is  sent  to  block  the roads to the west in order to prevent the\nremaining  holds  from  interfering.  With  the  tunnel  nearing  completion  in  5915  BA,\nDucaniel  sends  a  party  of  orcs  further  up  the  Daginrod  to  distract Orlazam-az-dihr,\nharassing the hold and skirmishing with their rangers.\n\nBreaking  through  into  Vale  just  a  year  later  in  5914  BA  at  what  is  now  known as\n"Orcsbreach"  (named  for  this  event),  the orcs pour out of the caves, being spotted nigh\ninstantly by the dwarves from their various watchtowers. As the orcs moved south to pillage\nand  burn  the  crops, the dwarven armies assembled to meet them, thus starting the Battles\nof  the  Serpent's  Vale.  Dwurim  IX, the High King, sent his forces of mostly infantry and\ncannons,  along  with the Amldavhad itself, through the Southern Entrance to meet the orcs\nhead  on.  Meanwhile,  Hurnik XIV, King of Lrazam-az-Dihr, sends his fabled Ram Riders\nled  by  renowned  general  Wolin  Greybuckle west to attack the orcs from the north. The\nthree  armies clashed and the orcs were decimated in combat, pushed back to the caves and\nstragglers  killed.  The  dwarves  attempted  to  barricade  the  breach  but  were  forced to\nabandon  it  after  a  larger  host  of  orcs attacked from the breach. Exhausted, the dwarves\nwere  unable  to  resist  and retreat with considerable losses. The Amldavhad held the line,\nallowing  Amldihr  forces to retreat to their hold while the Ram Riders, demoralized by the\ndeath  of  Wolin  Greybuckle,  flee  back  to  Orlazam-Az-Dihr.  With  the  retreat  of  the\ndwarven  forces, the orcs are able to besiege Verkal Vazkron from the Southern Entrance in\n5910  BA without resistance. It is noted that this moment represents a tipping point, where\nthe ever-increasing numbers of the orcs led to Ducaniel slowly losing control."

As the western forces\novercame  the barricades and garrisons that Ducaniel placed to keep the flank secure, High\nKing  Dwurim IX and King Hurmik XIV prepared their own armies from within Amldihr.\nKing  Hurnik  sent  his fastest ram rider north to Krakdûmvror to request aid, though their\nClan  Council, led by Thorar Trollslayer, was hesitant to send out its forces. They believed\nthat  even  if  the  entire  Dwarovar  fell, they would stand. In the end, worried that history\nwould  remember them as betrayers or cowards, the Grim Legion of Krakdhûmvror clad in\nIce-Steel  would  not  march  north  to  fight  the  old  giants  of yore, but south, to save an\nempire  that  had  shunned them. With the Grim Legion on the way, the Battle for Amldihr\ntruly  began.  Remnants  of Kronium and Ramsteel armmies sally out of Amldihr and meet\nthe  orcs  head  on  in  Verkal  Vazkron,  trapping  the orc armies. In major part due to the\nGrim  Legion,  by the day's end every orc that had stepped foot in Verkal Vazkron lay dead.\nTo  the dismay of the dwarves, an even larger orcish horde quickly approached, retaking the\nAmlvaz  tunnel  and  trapping  the  western  armies  in  Verkal Vazkron. Whilst the armies\nengaged,  the  orcs  in  the  east had managed to finally overcome the Hall of the Ancestors\nand  barely  six  months  after the fall of Verkal Vazkron, and the death of the Grim legion,\nthe orcs were directly assaulting Amldihr proper.\n\nBy  5888  BA,  the  orcs  broke  into  Amldihr through Verkal Vazkron and the Hall of the\nAncestors  with  ease,  with  little  to  no  defenders left to hold them back. Overtaking the\nAmlharaz  from  within  Amldihr  itself,  the orcs had achieved full control over the King's\nRock and the crushing defeat of Aul-Dwarov. Ducaniel, having lost control over a majority\nof  the  orcs  due  to  their innumerable quantity, attempted to keep the loyalty of what orcs\ndid  still  follow  him  by shattering the Dwarovkron and gifting it to them.

The experience is considered transformative\nand often shapes the rest of one's life.\n\n==Philosophical Views==\n===View of Society===\nThe  Thought  view  society  as a system that should be optimized for progress and growth.\nThis  can  be  achieved  through the continued advancement of knowledge, technology, and\nthe  values  that  shape  society.  The  Thought  prioritizes  equality  and individual liberty,\npromoting  a merit-based system where individuals are free to pursue their goals, so long as\nit  does not impede the progress and freedoms of others. It also emphasizes the importance\nof education and critical thinking, as well as encouraging collaboration between individuals\nand   communities   to  drive  innovation  and  advancement.  In  this  society,  people  are\nencouraged  to  take  an  active  role  in  shaping their environment and shaping the future,\nrather than being passive observers.\n\n===Views on Divinity and Faith===\nThe Thought views divinity, faith, and spirituality as concepts that are separate from reason\nand  evidence-based knowledge. It regards them as personal and subjective experiences, but\nnot  necessarily  as objectively true or universally applicable. The Thought holds that belief\nin  a  deity  or  divine  power  should  be  based on evidence and reason, and should not be\nblindly  accepted  without  questioning  and  examination. Instead, the Thought encourages\nindividuals to form their own beliefs and understandings of spirituality, guided by their own\nexperiences and the principles of logic and rationality.\n"

 page_events.2787.d: "\n===Views on Magic and Artificery===\nThe  Thought  is  a  philosophical  and  spiritual  ideology  that  had a profound impact on\ngnomish wizardry. The gnomish style of spellcasting, in turn, became heavily influenced by\nThe  Thought  and  its principles. The Thought views magic as a science, and it influenced\ngnomish  spellcasters  to  break  down  their  craft  into  a  more  systematic  and empirical\napproach.\n\nHowever,  despite  this  influence,  the  gnomish  style of wizardry ultimately failed to fully\nembody  the  ideals  of  The Thought due to the inherent limitations of magic itself. Magic\nhas  a  fundamental  nature of not being merit-based, meaning that some people are simply\nbetter  spellcasters than others. As a result, the pursuit of magic eventually lost prestige and\ngave  way  to  the  rise  of  artificery.  The  idea  of  utilizing  technology and engineering to\nachieve  the  same  ends as magic was seen as a more prestigious pursuit, and thus, became\nmore widely adopted by gnomes.\n\n==Criticisms==\nThe   Silmuna   School   of   Anbenncóst,   Department   of   Sociology,  has  conducted  a\ncomprehensive  study  on  the  impact  of The Thought on society. Based on the findings of\nthis  study,  it  can  be  concluded  that  The  Thought,  if  implemented  as  the  dominant\nphilosophy in a society, may have negative impacts on the emotional and spiritual aspects of\nlife.  This  is  because the emphasis on progress and efficiency can cause a lack of empathy\nand  disregard  for  individuals  who  may  be  struggling  due  to  external  factors  such  as\ndisabilities or injuries, thereby resulting in social inequality.\n\nAdditionally,  the  lack  of  spiritual  elements  in  The  Thought  has  been  identified  as a\npotential  factor  in  causing feelings of emptiness and existential crisis for individuals. The\nfocus  on  rational  decision-making,  according  to the study, can also result in a neglect of\nintuition  and  emotional  intelligence,  which are crucial for creativity and connection with\nothers.  Furthermore,  the  rigid  nature  of  The  Thought  has  been  criticized for stifling\ncreativity and individual expression."

This  period  saw  the  fall  of  several  more  western\nSerpentspine holds, and the saving of Khugdihr by the sacrifice of the Asra.\n\n=== The Fall of the Holds ===\nSymbolizing  the  start  of  a  period  of devastation was the ruin of the railways in 5876 BA\nwithout  the  Dagrite  Dwarves of Er-Natvir to maintain and electrify them, this too left the\nvarious holds in the Western Serpentspine stranded and isolated.\n\nFirst  amongst the holds to fall after Ducaniel's departure was Mithradhûm, having already\nbeen  sieged  down  for  60  years.  By  this  point  in  5860  BA the few defenders that had\nsurvived  were  ill-able  to defend the gates and the starving Mithril Dwarves fell quickly to\nthe  hordes.  Just 10 years later in 5850 BA came the fall of Orlazam-az-dihr in what many\nmight  consider  a  heroic manner. With their armies defeated and hero slain, the Ramsteel\nDwarves  decided  to  charge  out  into  the  fields  against  the orcs rather than wait for the\ninevitable starvation that the orcs would enforce upon them. With King Hurnik XIV in the\nlead, a number of orcs were felled by their assault up until their deaths, though it would be\nto no impact because of the orcs quickly multiplying numbers.\n\n=== Sacrifice of Ovdal Asra ===\nAt  the  same  time  as  the  charge  of Orlazam-az-dhr, King Murnir IX of Ovdal Asra, too\ndecided  to make a drastic decision. Having had already been sending his heir and as many\ndwarves  as  possible to flee the Serpentspine through the nearby caves, by the time the orcs\narrived in 5850 BA the hold was filled with only the most defiant of the dwarves. The Asra\nDwarves,  along  with  their  golems,  are written to have fought with no care of their lives,\nwith  the  only  purpose  that they may take as many orcs down with them as possible. After\nmany  heated  battles,  King  Murnir  IX  orders what is now debated between madness and\nvalour,  collapsing  Ovdal  Asra,  the surrounding caverns, and Dwarovrod 3. Both orc and\ndwarf  were  buried  in  the  area  and became impassable, saving Khugdihr from the orcish\ntides  for  many years up until the Greentide.

Despite  their  numbers,  these  barriers allowed for 100 years of prolonged fighting,\nduring  which  the  hold's  numbers only continued to dwindle. Queen Tharit II, known as\n"The  Weak",  decided  to  free  the  dwarf slaves and offer them freedom if they agreed to\ndefend  the  hold  despite  disagreement  from  the  Platinum Dwarves.

The  war  caused  the  near\ncomplete  downfall  of  Re'uyel, after the kingdom's meteoric rise to a position of hegemon\nof the western Divenhal in the decades prior.\n\n==History==\n===Prelude===\nThe incident that sparked the Third Cinder War happened in the late 13th century, when a\nmassive  gold  vein  was  discovered  near the Baharkandi citadel of Azka-Evran. Soon after\nmining  operations  started, Re'uyel started to demand a share of the revenues. Exasperated\nby  this  incident  as  well  as  multiple  previous  ridiculous  demands,  King  Kaltan  I  of\nBaharkand  started  to  actively  oppose  the  growing  influence of Re'uyel. Secret ties with\ncountries  wary  of Re’uyel’s naval and mercantile hegemony were established, including the\nelven  kingdoms  of  Irrliam  and Elizna, the dwarven hold of Ovdal Tûngr, and the human\nkingdoms of Ourdia and Busilar.\n\n=== Conflict ===\nKaltan's  plan  was ready to be set in motion by 1302. War on Re'uyel was declared - soon\nfollowed  by  the  other  members of the secret coalition - and the part of the Re’uyeli navy\nthat  was  docked  in  Aqatbar for maintenance was promptly seized. Despite their superior\nnumbers, the coalition still experienced setbacks at sea, but managed to keep the tide of the\nwar in their favour nonetheless, thanks to numerous victories on land.\n\nIn  response,  Re'uyel  entered  into an alliance with the Kingdom of Birzartanšes, allowing\nthem  to  isolate Kaltan's force in Bahar. The support of the Ekhani fleet was negotiated as\nwell to blockade Busilar and prevent any form of reinforcements from reaching Bahar.\n\nThe  tide  turned  yet  again  after the Kingdom of Eborthíl, afraid of the consequences of a\nRe'uyeli   victory,   entered   the  war  on  the  coalition's  side.  They  managed  to  finally\noverwhelm their opponent at sea and on land, forcing Re'uyel to sue for peace in 1311."

Thílvis\nwould eventually be absorbed into the Trollsbay Concord in the early 19th century with the\nConcord's transition into a full confederation.\n\n=== Lowtower Uprising ===\nBy  the  17th  century,  the  autocratic tendencies of the Assembly had become increasingly\nunpopular,  not  only  among the population but also some members of the Assembly itself\nwho hoped to curb the influence of their rivals. This escalated into the Lowtower Uprising,\nduring which three noble families challenged the authority of the rest of the Assembly."
 page_events.2795.t: "Thílvis Noble Republic 2 / 2"
 page_events.2795.d: "\n\nFollowing months of unrest in the capital and a siege of the Tower by the insurgents (hence\nthe  origin  of the name, since the lower tower was occupied for weeks), a compromise was\neventually found, with reforms allowing any Thílvisan of sufficient status to get a seat in the\nAssembly.  Although  the  founding  noble  families  still  had  guaranteed seats, this meant\nThílvis was no longer a true noble republic and had become significantly more democratic.\n\n=== Splinter Republics ===\nThis  compromise  was  not accepted by everyone however as many hoped for a governance\nmore  akin  to  those  of neighboring Cestirmark or Valorpoint, leading many disillusioned\nhalflings  to  create  a  country  more suitable to their ideals deeper inland. Most coalesced\naround  either  a  farmer by the name of Alvar Daxwell, founding the state of Daxwell near\nthe  Cliffs  of  Ruin,  or  Edmund  Barrows,  one  of  the  original conspirators, carving the\nrepublic of Spoorland out of previously Cheshoshi-controlled territory.\n\nWhile  Thílvis  would  try to assert its influence over the newly-founded republics, support\nfrom  the  nearby Lorentish colony of Núr Ionnidar would ensure their independence. This\nwould  start  an  influence  struggle  between  the  two  over Daxwell and Spoorland lasting\nabout  a  century.  By  the  19th  century  however,  they  had been partitioned between the\nTowerfoot  and  Lorentish,  with  most  of Spoorland being annexed into Núr Ionnidar and\nDaxwell being reduced to a rump state under firm Thílvisan control.\n===Age of New Building Blocks===\nWith  the  establishment  of  the  Ravelian  religion,  many in Thílvis especially among the\nAssembly  of  Thílvis  admired  the  goals  of  bringing  artificery  to  the common folk and\nquickly  converted to it. This also coincided with Thílvis's "Age of New Building Blocks".\nThílvis  using  their  connections  to  the  Gnomish  Hierarchy  from the roots of Viswaller\nnobility  in the government as well the early adoption of the practices of artificery entered a\nsmall  though  significant  period  of early industrialization. It soon became one of the first\nindustrialized states in Aelantir.\n"
 page_events.1471.t: "Tianlou 1 / 4"
 page_events.1471.d: "\n''This page describes the City of Tianlou. For the republic, see Republic of Tianlou.''\nTianlou  is  a  city on the mouth of the Yanhe and the eastern shore of Yanshen. It is one of\nthe  largest  cities  in  Haless, known as the "Jewel of Yanshen" for its vast riches due to its\nprime  spot for trade, its multitude of schools of philosophy, and its countless temples. The\ncity  is  known  for being a capital for empires such as Harimar's and Jaher's, though some\ncall  it  cursed  for  both  conquerors met their ends in the city. The centerpiece of the city,\nand  its  key landmark, is the largest high temple in Haless that towers above the rest of the\ncity, though various other massive towers dot the Tianlou skyline.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Beginnings ===\nAn  ancient  city, it is unclear when Tianlou was founded but it was likely always one of the\ngreatest cities in Yanshen as it is centered around the great high temple that reaches the sky.\nIt  would  truly begin to exponentially grow in 21, when the first treasure fleet arrived from\nZurankrek and began the decennial trade relations, making Tianlou only richer.\n\nThe  city  would become a key target for Harimar due to its high temple, he would even go\nso  far  as  to  make  the city his new capital. While overseeing the city he would upend the\nsocial  systems  greatly,  giving  rise  to  a  powerful  eunuch  caste  that would maintain its\nstrength  for  over  a thousand years, along with becoming a key product of Tianlou. In the\nend,  Harimar  would  go  missing  in  Tianlou's  temple  in 79, with no trace of him to be\nfound.\n\nOther nations would try to conquer Tianlou, such as Jiantsiang in 721, but it would remain\nresistant what with its access to wealth and powerful fortifications.\n\nIn  872  Zurkranreki  descended  merchants would be expelled from the city, after tensions\nflared between them and the native eunuchs and traders, giving birth to the cities long-time\nrivalry  with  Beikdugang.  By  881  the  city  of Beikdugang would nearly rival Tianlou, as\nTianlou had banned the Treasure Fleets."
 page_events.2796.t: "Tianlou 2 / 4"
 page_events.2796.d: "\n\n=== The Phoenix Empire ===\nThe  city's  rivalry  with  Jaher  would  Beikdugang  would prove their undoing, as in 1094\nBeikdugang  surrendered  to Jaher and aided him in their conquest of Tianlou. From 1094\nto 1096 Tianlou was besieged by Jaher's army, ultimately falling.\n\nJaher  would  declare  this  eastern  port  his new capital, calling for the construction of the\nHall  of  the  Rising  Sun.  The city would continue to prosper under Jaher's rule, until his\ndeath  in  the  city  in  the  year 1127. With his death, a destructive war broke out between\nBeikdugang  and  Tianlou,  weaking  both  cities, though Beikdugang would suffer more-so\ndue to spending decades under blockade.\n\n=== The Command ===\nPropersering  by  trading  with  Cannorians  since they first arrived in Tianlou in 1574, the\nrepublic of Tianlou which had been independent since Jaher's fall would come under threat\nin  1617.  With  the  republic,  and  the  rest  of  the  Tianlou  Concord,  at  war  with the\nCommand  in the First War of Yansheni Liberation, the Dragon Command had marched to\nthe  city  of Tianlou and laid siege to it in 1617. Despite the Dragon Command's artillery,\nthe Concord managed to push the Command back from the city.\n\nThis  victory  would only last 33 years as in 1650, in the Tianlou Campaign, also known as\nthe  War of Yansheni Dominion, the Command laid siege to the city again. The Command\nwas  forced  to withdraw to due the Concord's troops, yet again in 1655 the Command laid\nsiege against an exhausted Concord. Tianlou fell in 1658,\n\nUnder  the  administration  of  the  Dragon Command, Tianlou would prosper under "The\nDragon's Peace", a long period of growth and peace from 1662-1704. Seeing the city as its\nfuture   capital,   the  Dragon  Command  would  invest  heavily  into  rebuilding  Tianlou,\nimproving fortifications with minor artifice.\n"
 page_events.2797.t: "Tianlou 3 / 4"
 page_events.2797.d: "\nDespite  the Command initially allowing the establishment of Gommo offices in their land\nin  1667,  the  Gommo  would  be  exiled from Tianlou and elsewhere in the Command in\n1678  following  conflict  with the Dragon Command. Their offices in Tianlou were seized\nwith  military  force  and  cause  a souring of relations with the Gommo of the city, leading\nthem  to  covertly  make  an  agreement  with  the eunuchs. The Gommo agreed to provide\nfunding  and support for the eunuch rebellion in exchange for the reopening of the Gommo\noffice as an autonomous entity with limited (no looting) access to the high temple.\n\n=== Fight for Independence ===\nIn  1705  came the bloodless coup of Tianlou, the eunuchs of Tianlou had plotted in secret\nfor decades in order to catch the Dragon Command’s officials in a moment of unreadiness.\nThey played cooperative in order to lull the Dragon Command into a false sense of security\npriming  their  rebellion.  The  eunuch  rebellion,  which  would  come to be known as the\nbloodless  coup  began with a series of poisonings that caused the chain of command within\nthe  city  to  collapse.  Seizing  on  this  confusion,  eunuch  loyal  guards  and  militiamen\ncaptured or drove off the disorganised hobgoblin garrison. Despite the deaths that occurred\nthe  coup  was  referred  to  as bloodless due to the few deaths on both sides. The Dragon’s\nBreath  and  some  river  admirals  manage  to  flee  upstream  and  attempt  to  organise a\nretaliation to retake the city.\n\nWarfare  would  breakout  back  and  forth  for  decades,  leading up to the Third Yansheni\nLiberation War where an intense battle broke out at Tianlou's Gate in 1744. The Concord\nlaunched  a  surprise attack with the goal of killing the Dragon Marshal and succeeded, the\nnew  marshal,  Noriko  Dragonborn,  would  attempt  to  outsmart  the Concord forces but\nwould make slow progress. In 1751 peace talks would finally be carried out, though during\nnegotiations  the great temple of Tianlou was looted causing the rending. It turns out that a\nlocal rich man's son who had gambled away his money had hired a party and a korashi drill\nto raid the temple for money.\n\n=== The Rending of Realms ==="

 page_events.1474.t: "Tlagapatung Chiefdom 1 / 3"
 page_events.1474.d: "\nThe  Tlagapatung  Chiefdom  is  one  of  the  many  kingdoms  of  the Lupulan Rainforest,\nfamous  for  their  extreme  isolation  and  worship  of  the  malevolent  Great Spirit Semat\nTidakhui.  Its  inhabitants, the Tlaga, also known as the "whistling people," are known for\nhaving  unnatural  beauty  and  skilled  mages called geomancers who can manipulate earth\nand use the land as a medium for divination.\n\n==History==\n===Early History===\nAs  far  as all other Yanglam know, the Tlaga have always been in their little patch of jungle\nforever.  Their  land  is  far more infested by spirits and other supernatural beings than any\nother  part of the Lupulan, which is in itself a center of spirit activity. Little is known about\ntheir  history before Hebataan occupation and Caksak Sajan's rebellion, but the Tlaga have\nnever,  ever  left  their  homelands  in  known  history  up  until  the  Hebataan  came, and\ncompiling  various  pieces  of  history  and  folklore together have revealed that the earliest\nknown mention of the Tlaga in Yanglam history was somewhere around the 4th century.\n\n===Hebataan Invasion and Caksak Sajan's Rebellion===\nIn  1417  Tlagapatung's  peaceful  isolation  was  ended violently when Hebataan warriors,\naccompanied  by  the  soldiers  of Baihon Xinh, moved to occupy Tlagapatung, successfully\nbreaching  through  the  dense  jungle and the spirits . The Tlaga, never having to seriously\nfight  in  the  defense  of their home, were quickly subjugated and their famous geomancers\nforced  to  serve Hebat Hari. For many years the Tlaga, and all the other Yanglam toiled to\nfeed  Hebat Hari's new dominion, until in 1433 came Caksak Sajan. The very young chief,\nborn  just  5 years before the invasion desperately searched for a way to free his people. He\nfound  none  and  began  to  despair, before remembering the tale that gave Tlagapatung its\nname: A statue, on the bottom of the lake, that holds the power to give a person who offers\nit  unimaginable  prices  dominion  over all he sees. Out of options, Caksak Sajan swam to\nthe  bottom  of  the  lake  with  the aid of magic, and there at the very bottom he found the\nstatue.  The chief promised the loyalty of all of the whistling people, if it would grant them\nthe  power  to  defeat their oppressors. The statue accepted, giving Caksak Sajan command\nof a host of dark spirits, known as Hantu and making him a mage of immense power. With\nthese,  the  Tlaga  quickly  drove  off  the  Hebataan  occupiers,  inciting  all  of their other\nsubjects  to  revolt.  However,  the  occupation  and  rebellion, and the pact with the statue\nmade sure that Tlagapatung will never be as isolated as it once was."
 page_events.2818.t: "Tlagapatung Chiefdom 2 / 3"
 page_events.2818.d: "\n\n===Post-Rebellion History===\nIn  the  year  1619,  Tlagapatung  suffered a decade of constant disasters. Floods hit record\nhighs,  earthquakes shook the jungle, and hostile spirits swarmed the countryside. In 1627,\nto  round  off  all  these  misfortunes,  the  Pinghoi pirates invaded Tlagapatung, seeking to\nsubjugate  their  inhabitants.  Though the Tlaga fought bravely, their state was so shaken by\ndisaster  that  it  simply  could  not  afford  to bring Tlagapatung's full military potential to\nbear.  Thus, the king at this time led a band of soldiers to Semat Tidakhui, begging it once\nmore  to  deliver  its  followers  from  destruction.  What  transpired  appears to be forever\nunknown  but  after 7 days the king returned with a band of Hantu. These Hantu routed the\nPinghoi  pirates  easily,  emanating  negative energy in waves so strong that those they faced\noften  routed  outright.  How  Semat  Tidakhui  could  summon a host of this magnitude is\nunknown.\n\n==Culture and Society==\n===The Whistling People===\nKnown  as  such due to the use of whistles to communicate orders between troops and send\nmessages  over  long  distances, the Tlaga are perhaps some of the most mysterious peoples\nin  all  of  Haless. They rarely interact with outsiders, so much so that the only opportunity\nto  truly  see  one  is during a diplomatic outing. Their appearances are often breathtaking,\nfor  a  skin  as  white  as  porcelain combined with intricate, beautiful clothing combines to\ncreate  some  of  the most attractive people in Haless. Few can resist the charms of a Tlaga\ndiplomat, for their unearthly charm is hard to look away from.\n\n===Dyes for Divination===\nSomething  that  has  only  been  recently  discovered  about  the  Tlaga  is their affinity for\ngeomancy.  Capable  of  manipulating  the  earth  and  shaping  it  into various forms, their\ngeomancers  are  also capable of reading the subtle signs of a land that knows all - a sort of\ndivination.  The  pastel tones of their dyes are used to divine the future, with various colors\nrepresenting   different   circumstances.   For   example,   an   individual's  love  might  be\ndetermined by burying pink dye and uttering the individual's name. The earth shall provide\nan answer - sometimes clear, sometimes not."
 page_events.2819.t: "Tlagapatung Chiefdom 3 / 3"
 page_events.2819.d: "\n\n===A Domain for Every Clan===\nEvery  family is provided their own land, guaranteed to be theirs forever. This land, though\nthe  government  expects  a  small  sum of their output, is theirs and theirs alone, free to be\ngoverned  and  utilized  as  the  owning  family  sees  necessary. These rights draw from the\nTlaga belief that all deceased individuals are tied to the land upon which they perished, and\nso  guaranteeing  families  land  to  reside upon allows for their ancestors to stay united and\nstrong.  What this means for the state is that it owns far less land than what official records\nindicate,  but  there  is  another  reason  for  this:  Many  malignant  beings lurk within the\nLupulan rainforest, and every family parcel is one plot less that the state must guard.\n\n===Council of Pawangs===\nThere  is  a council of pawangs (Yanglam mages who appease and/or contain spirits) within\nTlagapatung,  a  circle  who selects only the oldest and most skilled of the mages available,\nthough  they  do  take  apprentices.  This  group  is  charged  with a very special duty: The\ninvestigation  and  expulsion  of  any runaway supernatural beings around Tlagapatung. The\nsection  of  the  Lupulan  that  they  reside  in  is  particularly  infested  with  spirits  (both\nmalicious  and  benevolent) and is rife with their influence. For this, the efficient operation\nof the council is a necessity. In exchange for their duties, this council has managed to carve\nitself  out  a  very needed niche in the government, and the pawangs hold great influence in\nthe government, unlike lesser spirit hunters common in the rest of Haless.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
 page_events.1475.t: "Tluukt 1 / 9"
 page_events.1475.d: "\nThe  Tluukt  pack  was  a gnollish nation that arose in Bulwar following the collapse of the\n[https://anbennar.fandom.com/wiki/Akalate_of_Zan%C5%A1ap Šad Sur Akalate] and the\nensuing   conflicts   of   the   late   Age   of   Cinders.   Formed   in  1413  AA  by  Tluukt\n‘Cleaver-of-Realms’,   the   Tluukt   pack   would  embark  upon  a  series  of  expansionist\ncampaigns  beginning  in  1439,  resulting  in a thirteen year period of domination over the\nSuran  Plain  up  until  the  Battle of Eduz-Buranun in 1452. The gnolls of Tluukt retained\ntheir  sovereignty  and  control of the Šad Sur for another 55 years, until they were annexed\nby the Jaddari Legion in 1507.\n\n\n\n==History==\n===Early History===\nThe control of the Šad Sur had long been contested by gnolls and Bulwari, who have across\nvarious  periods  of  history each seen themselves as native to the region. With the collapse\nof  the  Phoenix  Empire  in  1162 AA, Sandfang gnolls began once again to encroach upon\nthe  Akalate  of  Šad Sur, culminating in the early 1300s when a massive gnoll pack sacked\nthe  fortress-city  of  Ekluzagnu.  The  royal  family  and a considerable number of refugees\nmanaged  to  escape  -  escorted  by  Irrliami  forces - to the city of Zanšap where the Akal\npledged  his  allegiance  to  the  Irrliazuir  dynasty.  Those who did not escape were largely\nforced   into   slavery,  though  notable  populations  of  free  Šadnatu  remained  prevalent\nthroughout the mountains up until the rise of Tluukt.\n\nThe  gnoll  pack  that seized Ekluzagnu did not last, however, and following the death of its\nleader dissolved into countless tribes. These tribes did not submit to any one pack lord but\ninstead  carved  up  the  Šad Sur between themselves, subsisting primarily off of banditry of\nboth  the  local  Šadnatu populations and populations of the Suran Plain who dwelt nearby.\nThe  most  powerful of these bandit packs divided control of Ekyrigrax - their name for the\nconquered Ekluzagnu - amongst themselves and frequently collected tribute from what they\nsaw  as  the  “lesser”  packs  of the Šad Sur. Ekyrigrax became a thriving market for slaves,\nand  even  saw  custom  from  foreign merchants despite the lawlessness of the surrounding\nŠad Sur."
 page_events.2820.t: "Tluukt 2 / 9"
 page_events.2820.d: "\n\n===Rise of Tluukt===\nThis  status  quo,  which  had  persisted  uninterrupted  for  nearly a century, began to shift\nrapidly  in  the  1420s  when  the  gnollish  witch Tluukt ‘Fishcleaver’ began to aggressively\nexpand  her  pack’s  influence  in  the  Šad Sur through various combinations of diplomacy,\nsubterfuge,  and  armed  coercion. She bore in particular a grudge against the pack-lords of\nEkyrigrax,  and  refused  to  pay tribute to them. Intermittent skirmishes between her forces\nand  those  of  Ekyrigrax became common, and she earned a foul reputation for defying the\nban  against  slaying  the foreign merchants who otherwise connected Ekyrigrax to the lands\noutside the Šad Sur.\n\nDespite   her   prior  successes,  Tluukt  ‘Fishcleaver’  lacked  the  resources  and  defenses\nprovided by Ekyrigrax, and so steadily began to lose ground in the early 1430s as more and\nmore  of  her pack defected. Realizing that only bold action could cement the loyalty of her\nunderlings  and  give  her  an advantage against her foes, she led her tribe northwards, away\nfrom their traditional hunting grounds and towards the lands still under the authority of the\nZanšapi  akals.  Tluukt  correctly  surmised  that  Irrliam  -  weakened after the War of the\nEmber   Queens   -  would  be  unable  to  defend  their  border  territories  against  gorilla\nincursions,  and so in 1434 she began a series of increasingly harsh and savage raids against\nnotable  land-owners  in  the  province  of Arfajazan. The atrocities conducted during these\nraids  so  incensed Akal Bavar III szal-Barseen of Zanšap that, against the better judgement\nof  his  advisors,  he  rallied  together  a  force  of  his  own  and  pursued  Tluukt  into the\ngnollish-controlled  Šad  Sur,  intent  on  claiming  the  head  of the vile bandit who had so\ntortured  his  people.  Yet, unlike his royal forebears, Akal Bavar III had not been raised in\nthe  Šad  Sur  as Tluukt had, and had not grown familiar with its crags and peaks. So it was\nthat  he  and  all his forces - warriors all who prided themselves on their Šadnatu heritage -\nultimately  found themselves fallen victim to the Šad Sur’s labyrinthine passages, winnowed\nto  the last man by traps and ambushes sprung by the crafty Tluukt. Tluukt herself slew the\nAkal Bavar III, and in the wake of her victory she and her pack pushed into the province of\nArfajazan,  enslaving  peasants  and  nobles  alike. Tluukt herself became celebrated by the\ngnolls  of  the  Šad Sur as a mighty pack mistress, the first to lay claim to Bulwari land ever\nsince the collapse of the Šad Sur Akalate."
 page_events.2821.t: "Tluukt 3 / 9"
 page_events.2821.d: "\n\nGalvanized  by this victory and the prestige it earned her - along with the substantial wealth\nseized  from  the  landowners  of  Arfajazan  -  Tluukt  immediately  began  subjugating the\nremaining  packs  of the Šad Sur, many of whom in fact joined forces with her willingly, so\nconvinced  were  they by her promises of further victories against the Bulwari. By 1436 AA\nthe  only  hold-out  against  her  ambitions  were  the  bandit-lords  of  Ekyrigrax  who still\npersisted  in  their  vain  attempts  to  dominate  her.  Now  at  the  head of a considerable\ngnollish  host,  Tluukt  put  Ekyrigrax  under  a  brutal  siege  for  two  years,  starving  the\ndefenders  out  while  she  and her pack continued to subsist off of the supplies seized from\nArfajazan.  The  defenders  inevitably  broke,  and  their  bandit  lords  were quickly put to\ndeath,  their  corpses  strung  from the battlements and left to be claimed only by buzzards.\nTluukt  had at last asserted herself as sole undisputed pack mistress of the Šad Sur, and she\nsoon  drove  out  whatever  populations of free Šadnatu remained, rewarding the packs that\nhad served her most loyally with the lands seized thereby.\n\n===Subjugation of Bulwar===\nBy  the spring of 1439 AA, Tluukt had begun mustering the tribes of the Šad Sur for battle,\nre-organizing  their numbers into a cohesive host. In this matter she faced no small amount\nof  resistance,  as  the  packs  of the Šad Sur still maintained a fierce tradition of autonomy\nand could not be easily cowed. She soon turned her attention outwards, seeking to secure a\nreal  victory  under  which  her  pack  could  rally  behind.  Instead of pushing further into\nZanšap  or Irrliam, however, she marched her host directly towards the city of Bulwar - the\njewel  of  the  Suran,  chosen  as  her  target  for  its symbolic value, its weariness under its\nVaramhari overlords, and of course its magnificent wealth.\n\nAs  her forces settled around the walls of Bulwar, however, the enormity of the task at hand\nsoon  became  evident.  A  protracted  siege  risked  the  possibility  of a neighboring elven\nkingdom coming to the aid of their besieged Varamhari neighbors. Despite her background\nfirst  as  a  fishcarver  and  second  as  a bandit lord, however, Tluukt had remained keenly\naware  of  the  political  events occurring outside of the Šad Sur and was thus well aware of\nKing  Karodir  I  of Varamhar’s reputation as a prideful wizard. Seeking to exploit this, she\nchallenged  the  monarch  to  a  magical  duel.  Karodir  I,  confident  in  his  ability  as  a\nclassically  trained  elven  mage,  naturally  accepted  under the belief that he could quickly\neliminate his gnollish opponent. This belief soon proved ill-founded, as Karodir had vastly\nunderestimated  Tluukt’s  skill  in  abjuration and evocation. She quickly broke through his\nmagical  wards  and soon had him on the backfoot, and many feared that Karodir would be\nignominiously slain by this gnollish witch. Tluukt, however, did not perform a killing blow\nupon  Karodir  -  she  instead continued to savage him, practically torturing him in magical\ncombat.  Thus,  the battle was long and gruesome, and Karodir’s defeat so sound that given\nthe first opportunity he fled from Bulwar entirely, taking the bulk of his forces with him."
 page_events.2822.t: "Tluukt 4 / 9"
 page_events.2822.d: "\n\nIn  the  wake of this disorderly retreat, Tluukt’s forces stormed the city’s walls and captured\nthem  after  a  bloody  battle with the remaining defenders. The subsequent sack of the city\nwas  brutal,  with entire districts burnt to cinders overnight, their treasures seized to placate\nTluukt’s  loyalists.  In  a  display  of dominance Tluukt would force the Twelve Families of\nBulwar  to  recognize  her  as  their overlord before her assembled host of gnolls, but other\nthan  that  she  would  leave  them  and  the  city’s  governance structures largely intact. To\ndissuade  any possible rebellion, however, she completely destroyed the city’s walls, leaving\nit  totally  undefended  should  her protection be revoked. With the jewel of the Suran now\nfirmly  under  her  control  and the elven king Karodir I defeated, gnolls and Bulwari alike\nwould from this point onwards come to know Tluukt as the ‘Cleaver-of-Realms’.\n\n===Alliance with Zokka===\nEven before Tluukt had seized control of the Šad Sur, to her east a gnoll pack led by Zokka\n‘Devourer-of-Suns’  was  enjoying  an  unprecedented  level  of success against the remnant\nkingdoms  of  the  Phoenix  Empire.  Zokka ruled over a vast swathe of territory stretching\nfrom the Far Salahad to the Upper Suran and collected substantial tribute from the cities of\nHarklum and Eduz-Vacyn.\n\nIn  1443  the  kingdoms  of  Azka-Sur  and  Sareyand, threatened by Zokka’s expansionism,\nsponsored rebellion amongst his human subjects. A coalition of human rebels supported by\nelven  warriors  marched  against Zokka - and was utterly crushed, resulting in the death of\nKing  Erlian  of  Azka-Sur. Though this united effort ended in total failure of Azka-Sur and\nSareyand,  the  danger of Bulwar uniting against the gnolls was now a more credible threat.\nTluukt, already impressed with the control Zokka exerted over his territory, sought to forge\nher own alliance with the gnollish warlord, and an agreement was made to divide the Suran\nbetween the two packs.\n\nWhether  this  agreement  would  have  ultimately  been  honored  is  a matter of historical\ndebate,  as  the alliance would prove short-lived. In 1445 Zokka, incensed by the “ghost of\nthe  Phoenix  Empire"  he  saw  in the Jaddari Legion, would declare war against the desert\nelves  in  order  to determine rulership of the eastern sands. His advances into the territory\ncontrolled  by  the Sihrušam were initially successful, with even the combined forces of the\ndesert  elves  and  the  Mašnsih nomads proving unable to resist him. At the Battle of Sun’s\nProvidence,  however,  Zokka  ‘Devourer-of-Suns’  met  his  end,  slain in personal combat\nagainst  the  Divine  Herald  Jaddar.  Following  the death of their pack lord, Zokka’s pack\nquickly dissolved, with many fleeing to the safety of Tluukt’s borders. Those who remained\n- including Zokka’s heir - would ultimately be assimilated into the Jadd."
 page_events.2823.t: "Tluukt 5 / 9"
 page_events.2823.d: "\n\nWith  Zokka  dead  and  the  territory  controlled  by  his pack rapidly falling into Jaddar’s\ncontrol,  Tluukt  would  rush  in  an  attempt to assert herself as sole overlord of the Suran\nPlain. Her forces quickly sallied out and subjugated Harklum, but by the time that she was\nready  to  march  upon  Eduz-Vacyn,  Jaddarin  forces had already established a new border\nsurrounding it.\n\n===Suzerainty of the Suran===\nWith  the  expectation  that  Jaddar  would  continue  marching in pursuit of Zokka’s gnolls\ndirectly  into  her own lands, Tluukt began to rapidly consolidate her forces and the Zokka\nrefugees into a single fighting host. Her expectations would be subverted, however, when in\n1446  Sareyand  declared war upon the Jaddari Legion after diplomatic attempts to reclaim\nthe  territories  they  had  lost  to  Zokka were rebuffed. With her forces already mustered,\nTluukt  seized  the  opportunity  provided  by  this  chaotic  conflict  to  strike  out  against\nSareyand  as  well,  quickly  seizing control of Zanbar. Accosted on both sides by elves and\ngnolls,  Sareyand  was  forced  to  concede  their claims to Jaddar and recognize him as the\nProtector  of  the  Suran  and  Tluukt  as  overlord  of Zanbar. During this conflict, Tluukt\nlargely  avoided  Jaddarin  forces,  wary  of  the  possibility  of uniting Sareyand and Jaddar\nagainst her.\n\nWith  Sareyand  defeated  and  with  Jaddar  turning  his  attention  away  from Bulwar and\ntowards  his  eastern  borders,  the  Tluukt  pack  enjoyed  a brief period as overlord of the\ncentral  Suran  Plain.  In  this  time  period  Tluukt  would  begin  imposing  a  number of\nregulations   and  unusual  reforms  upon  both  her  gnoll  subordinates  and  her  Bulwari\nsubjects,  early  steps in what she saw as the birth of a “modern gnollish kingdom”. Zanbar\nin  particular  would  feel  the  brunt  of these reforms, with Tluukt directly meddling in its\ngovernance  such  that  even  after  the  downfall  of  her  pack  the  cultural  impact of her\noverlordship would be enduring.\n\nIn  addition to meddling with the day to day governance in her Bulwari subjects, this period\nof  supremacy  along  the Suran saw the final crackdowns on insubordinate gnoll packs and\nthe  centralization  of  the  gnollish  host  under  Tluukt’s  direct  authority. Inspired by the\nJaddari  Legion’s  flexibility and wary of the recovering elven kingdoms and the scheming of\nher  own  subjects, Tluukt would also establish the first gnollish standing army, a retinue of\nveterans drawn from her own pack and adopted Zokka refugees that would be known as the\n“Skull-Cross Ravagers”."

 page_events.2824.d: "\n\n===Rebellion and Decline===\nThe  Twelve  Families  of  Bulwar  had  at this point suffered under Tluukt’s rule for over a\ndecade,  and  since  1445 had seen their authority steadily eroded as the Tluukt pack began\nto  assert its own laws over the areas it controlled. Inspired by Jaddar’s victory over Zokka,\nhowever,  they  began  to  act  against  Tluukt’s  representatives  and  by  1450  had  roused\nsignificant  popular  support  among  the  Surani for a rebellion to overthrow their gnollish\nsuzerain.  The  city as a whole took up arms and cast out the Tluukti envoys, soon securing\ncontrol  of  the fields and villages surrounding Bulwar and the river-crossings of the Suran.\nThese   early  victories  had  been  hard-won,  but  as  the  rebellion  continued  it  became\nincreasingly  clear  that  Tluukt  had to some degree anticipated unrest among her subjects,\nand  the  Bulwari found their manpower reserves rapidly depleting as their cunning gnollish\nfoe  whittled  them  down  with  traps,  raids,  and ambushes, not deigning to meet them in\nopen combat until her victory was assured.\n\nIt  was  in  1452  AA that this time came to pass, and Tluukt and her Skull-Cross Ravagers\nemerged  from their garrisons in full force in order to crush what remained of the rebellion\nin  an  overwhelming  display  of  dominance,  her  victory  now all but assured. Her forces\nout-maneuvered the Bulwari and pinned them down in the plains of Eduz-Buranun, against\nthe  banks  of  the  river.  By  all contemporary accounts what followed should have been a\nslaughter  -  yet  the  Bulwari held. For twenty-four hours, from the dawn of the first day of\nbattle  to  the  dawn  of the second, the peasants and poorly-armed warriors of Bulwar held\nmiraculously  against tide upon tide of battle-scarred gnoll veterans. And as the sun rose on\nthe  second  day, the tide of battle turned when troops from Harklum and Zanbar - inspired\nby  Bulwari  resistance  -  made  a  timely  arrival,  crushing Tluukt’s army in a devastating\npincer  strike.  The  three  cities  would  band  together  in  their resistance against Tluukt,\nforming the Naqtazan - the River Alliance. With her army decimated and herself wounded,\nTluukt  and  the  Skull-Cross Ravagers fled in retreat to Ekyrigrax, relinquishing the pack’s\ncontrol of the Suran Plain to the Naqtazan.\n"
 page_events.2825.t: "Tluukt 7 / 9"
 page_events.2825.d: "\nDespite  her  humiliating  defeat at Eduz-Buranun, Tluukt would retain a firm control over\nher  gnollish  subordinates  and  the  Šad  Sur  as  a  whole,  repelling  any  attempts by the\nNaqtazan  to  hunt  her  down.  The  Naqtazan  rebellion  simmered  to  an informal peace\nbetween   both   parties,   though   Tluukt  herself  would  never  officially  recognize  their\nindependence.  Even  after  she recovered from her injuries, territorial expansion out of the\nŠad  Sur  would  cease  as the various realms of Bulwar neighboring her recovered from the\nAge  of  Cinders.  She  would maintain a feared reputation of cunning ferocity, however, in\nher  savage  reprisals  against  any  elven  or  Bulwari army foolhardy enough to attempt an\nincursion  into her lands. Thus, the prospect of ousting the gnolls from the Šad Sur became\nincreasingly   untenable   to  the  Bulwari  kingdoms  so  long  as  the  ‘Cleaver-of-Realms’\ncontinued to rule from Ekyrigrax.\n\nOver  the next ten years, Tluukt would continue to administer her realm with an increasing\nlevel  of  ritual  formality.  Her  will  was  enforced  by  the  remnants  of  her Skull-Cross\nRavagers while she dictated reforms she saw as crucial to reclaiming their lost territory and\nstanding  on  an  equal  footing  to  her  rivals.  She  is  reported to have said that of all the\npowers  of  Bulwar,  the  only  ones  she  considered  her  equals  were those of the Jaddari\nLegion,  who  had  defeated her former ally Zokka. Her greatest preparations were made to\ncrush  what  she  saw as an inevitable invasion of her lands by the Divine Herald Jaddar - a\nprediction  that  seemed  increasingly  unlikely  as the years passed and Jaddar continued to\nfocus on his eastern borders.\n\n===Death of Tluukt, Birth of Tluuktraak===\nOn the 25th of Yshdament, 1463 AA, Tluukt ‘Cleaver-of-Realms’ passed away in her sleep,\nhaving suffered an illness acquired the week before. Having lived for seventy-two years and\nruled over her pack for fifty, her reign was considered long even by non-gnollish standards.\nThe  contemporary expectation of her Bulwari enemies was that with her death the Šad Sur\nwould  devolve  to  the  banditry  and  infighting  that had prevailed before her ascension to\npower. Yet, unlike in Zokka’s pack, Tluukt’s death did not herald an immediate dissolution\nor  even a protracted power grab. Instead her chosen successor, Aaryz ‘Cleaver-of-Realms’,\nhosted  a grand feast at Ekyrigrax where the matriarchs of the tribes subordinate to Tluukt’s\npack  joined  him  in  ritually  cannibalizing  the  corpse of Tluukt. Following the feast the\nmatriarchs  offered formal displays of submission to his authority in an elaborate succession\nritual - designed by Tluukt herself - where the last of the pack’s fading opulence was put on\nfull display. Inspired by the bold actions of his predecessor, Aaryz would formally proclaim\nhis  inheritance not of a pack, but of a true kingdom - the Tluuktraak Akalate, and his oath\nupon coronation was to restore the borders established by his grandmother."

 page_events.2826.d: "\n\nYet one cannot subsist on dreams and loyalty alone, and without the rulership of Tluukt the\nkingdom  founded  by  her  successors  began to steadily lose territory as elven and Bulwari\nforces  increasingly  incurred  upon  its  borders.  While  the  fifty  years  of Pack Mistress\nTluukt’s  reign  saw  both  great  successes and great defeats, the comparatively brief twelve\nyear  reign  of Akal Aaryz saw only loss after loss, a trend continued by his own successors.\nThe standing army established by Tluukt withered as the last of her treasure was spent, and\nher  successors  proved  unable  to  devise  new sources of wealth. With an empty treasury,\nTluuktraak  was  forced  to  revert  back  to  relying  primarily on its subordinate packs for\nmilitary  support,  and  as  wealth  turned to poverty the government Tluukt envisioned was\nincreasingly supplanted by ad hoc measures and arbitrary rule.\n\n===Annexation by the Jaddari===\nBy  1491  AA,  Tluuktraak had been reduced to a rump state that exerted control only over\nthe  fortress-city  of  Ekyrigrax  and  the  hills  that  surrounded  it,  as well as a number of\nkrahways stretching into the Salahad. Yet their existence at all still posed a problem to their\nneighboring  states,  and  an  alliance  to  push  them  out of Bulwar entirely was one of the\ntopics  that  would  be  brought  up at the summit at Samartal that year, alongside alliances\nagainst  the  harpies  and the Jaddari Legion. The summit would end disastrously, however,\nwith  the  Tragedy  of  Samartal  shattering the veneer of unity between the Bulwari realms,\nrekindling  a  brief  period  of  internecine  conflict.  With  this  collapse  of  relations, the\npressures  exerted  upon  Tluuktraak  by  Bulwari  and  elven  realms  lessened  drastically,\nallowing  its  rulers  time  to  fortify their holdings and muster for a reclamation of the Šad\nSur.\n\nThis  planned  reclamation  would  never  transpire,  however.  Following Samartal, Jaddar\nwould  at  last  return his attention to Bulwar. His forces toppled the remnants of Sareyand\nin 1494 and quickly thereafter conquered the Naqtazan in 1495. At the turn of the century,\nhe  would  declare  a  final  war  against  gnolls  -  against  Tluuktraak, and would devote a\nportion  of  his army to invading the Šad Sur. The war would prove difficult for both sides,\nas  it  was  soon  made  evident to the Jaddarin forces that the revanchist zeal of Tluuktraak\nhad not waned since the death of Tluukt. In each battle the Tluukti warriors would fight to\ntheir  final  breaths,  delaying Jaddar’s advance through the already unfavorable terrain. The\ncapture  of  the  fortress-city  of Ekyrigrax would prove particularly costly, with Jaddar first\ndedicating  considerable forces to seizing the krahways that supplied it, allowing his army to\nsettle  down  for  a  long  siege.  The  warriors  of  Tluuktraak  held out against hunger and\ndespair for over a year, however, refusing to surrender. Even when in 1507 a sizable breach\nhad  been  created  in  the fortress walls, Jaddar and his warriors were forced to go through\nthe citadel floor by floor, slaying the half-starved defenders to the very last gnoll."

Even today many ancient customs and rituals that emerged in the time\nof  Tluukt  can still be observed among the Sandfang gnolls of the Šad Sur, though they are\nquickly   being   supplanted   by   more   cosmopolitan  behaviors  as  the  region  becomes\nincreasingly interconnected with modern Bulwari cities.\n\n==Government==\n\n==Society==\n\n==Military==\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

 page_events.1480.d: "\nToronami  Saikochi was a renowned Raheni Hobgoblin historian of war whose writings are\noften  considered  on-par  with  Lián  Zhu's  in  regards  to  warfare. The leading source of\nknowledge  in  regards  to a plethora of topics, including the rise and fall of the Command,\nthe fall of the Raj, and the Triple Alliance War amongst others, Toronami Saikochi's works\nthroughout the late 1700s have become the basis for military curriculum across Haless.\n\n== Early Life ==\nGrowing  up  in the tail end and aftermath of the Rending, much of Toronami's early years\nwere  encompassed  by  the  chaos  this  disaster brought upon Haless. With minor nations\nsuch  as  Lingyuk  rapidly  expanding  and continental powerhouses such as The Command\ncrumbling  under  the  Great  Insubordination,  there was seemingly little that made sense.\nHowever, even as a child Toronami seemed to find clarity in entropy, expressing interest in\nart  instead  of  the  blades  that  many  among him picked up. They say once when a battle\nbroke out near his village, he was seen on a nearby ridge painting the scene, capturing each\nminiscule  detail.  Unfortunately  for  him, this passion would have to be put on hold as in\nhis teens he was conscripted by The Command to fight rebel forces.\n\nGruesome   battles  would  take  place  as  the  rebels  fought  back  The  Command,  with\nToronami  being  caught  on  the  frontlines  of  a few himself.

Unforeseen by anyone, his service in the\nmilitary  would  lead  to  his  talent  for  art  and  his  military  experiences combining and\nflourishing  into  a new passion, one for a deeper understanding of what he had been forced\nto  live  through.  Having  finished  his time in the military, he would enroll in the Jiangdu\nacademy of war.\n\n== Schooling ==\nWithin  his  time  in  the  academy,  his talents would see themselves blossom even further,\nquickly  becoming  known  for  his  unparalleled ability to put himself in the perspective of\nthose  he  read about. Part of his process in fact, was to first paint an image of the battle or\nevents  that  he  had  read  about  as  he  imagined  it,  using  these  paintings to further his\nunderstanding.  Many  say  he could have simply stopped at doing art, that his creative skill\nin  that alone could have supported him, yet his passion for the history of war would not let\nhim  do  so.

Composed mostly of Khamgunai\nthere  were  some  Metsamic  and  Zabtalari  sailors on board, these sailors would often go\nwork  regular  jobs  as  merchants  go  trade the goods around the island between the fleet's\njourneys.  The  fleet  was  managed  and  maintained  by  Zurkanrek,  even  when the Lake\nFederation  had  united,  with  an  office of the government being responsible for its timely\nrunning.\n\n== Route ==\n\n#  Zurkanrek  - Starting here, the fleet departed eastwards carrying luxury goods, glassware,\ntextiles, and sometimes gold to Tuchuweg."

It\nwas  unable, however, to force the other kingdoms to submit to the authority of its kings or\nmake the Rubentis yield the Ruby Crown and the High Kingdom of Lencenor with it.

The  species  is  highly  adaptable  to  a  great  many\nenvironments, and accordingly, many regions have their own ethnic group of troll.\n\n==Society==\nMost  trolls live in small familial packs of 3-12 and are semi-nomadic in nature, living the\nlifestyle  of  travelling  hunters.  They  are  capable of devouring any and all things, ranging\nfrom local fauna to any humans unlucky enough to cross their path. Due to their incredible\nregenerative  abilities,  trolls  are  difficult to kill and quickly become the apex predators of\nwhichever territory they appear in, often devastating the local wildlife before moving on.\n\n===Strange Morality===\n''Excerpt taken from "Of Trolls and Men - The Comprehensive Guide to Trollkind"''\n\nUnlike their giantkin cousins, trolls are far more bestial in nature, and their lack of civility\ncomprises  of  several,  defining  characteristics.  One: Their animalistic demeanour. Two:\nTheir  general  dim-wittedness.  And  three,  the  most  peculiar characteristic of all: Their\nalien  morality.  Charity, mercy. Ruthlessness, cruelty. The average troll cares not for these\ncornerstones  that  dictate  our  own  understanding  of morality. Instead, trolls follow their\nown code of conduct:\n\n''"My might makes right."''\n\nIndeed,  a  troll's  moral  code  is  not  influenced by societal expectations. They simply do\nwhatever  it is that pleases them in the moment. As such, one must be aware of each troll's\ndistinctive  personality  when  dealing  with them. Some trolls may enjoy being fair or even\ngenerous. Others may track you down and slaughter your village for the crime of looking at\nthem the "wrong way".\n\nDue  to  this... unpredictability, those who dare bargain with trolls often do so with simple\nexchanges  and  contracts:  if  you  guard and maintain this bridge we'll pay you. If you stay\naway from this place, we will provide food, and so forth."

Part of this behavioral disparity can be attributed to\nthe  millennia  the  Fjord  Trolls  spent  as  rabid  warriors  and  servants to their Ice Giant\nmasters.

The  first  mention  of  some sort of Trollsbay union comes from Varil sína\nCymainé,  an  early  proponent  of  unification  whose  writings  at  the  time  were  widely\nridiculed.\n\nThe  idea  would  not  be  taken  seriously  until  the following century, when Cestirmarker\nintellectuals  would revive the idea of Trollsbay collaboration against outside threats, which\nsoon  would  be  put to test as the War of the Coalition against the Aelnari state made clear\nto  all  the  republics  of  the  bay  that  only  combined  their  militias  could hope to resist\ncannorian forces.\n\n==Founding==\n\nWhen  created  in 1595, it comprised of Cestirmark, Marlliande, Zanlib, Isobelin, Thílvis\nand  Valorpoint,  and the list would be expanded to include Daxwell and Ynnsmouth in the\n18th century.\n\nArchives  from  the  time  show  that no member wanted to really commit to the alliance, a\nstate  of  affairs  that would only change due to Erandil Poison-Arrow's intervention. When\nLorentish  forces  took  control  of  Endralliande  from  the  elves  during the Rianvisa, the\nTrollsbayers  used  the  opportunity  to  strike at a weakened Aelnar, an event known as the\nWar  of  the  Coalition  in  the  Trollsbay (and considered a smaller part of the Rianvisa by\ncannorian  historians).  With support from the Yaneks and the Ynnics, they were eventually\ntriumphant  in  1630,  a  date sometimes used as the Concord's founding as it was then the\ntreaty was ratified by all members.\n\nWhile  dissent  in  the  very  diverse  Trollsbay  threatened  the  alliance  in its early stages,\nLorent's  ambitions  in  the  region  were  the  main driving force behind the success of the\nConcord.  The  Trollsbayers  would  adopt  out  of  necessity  the  policy  of an "ever more\nharmonious   Concord",   for   their   independence   could   only  be  guaranteed  through\ncooperation."

However,  the  entirety  of  the  Bloodgroves  being\nannexed  by  Lorent  and  inability  by  Trollsbayers  to  contest Lorentish forces meant this\ndream   would  never  come  to  pass.  Nonetheless,  the  Concord  has  been  a  notorious\nsupporter of Sornicandi independence movements ever since.\n\nThe  secession  of  the  republics  of  Daxwell  and  Spoorland  from  Thílvis following the\nLowtower Uprising several decades later led to many disagreements over how to handle the\nsituation.  While  the  official  line  of  the  Concord was to favor reintegration, there were\nmultiple  proposals  to  welcome  the  two  republics  as  full members of the Concord as a\nmean to prevent them from falling under Lorentish influence.\nUltimately,  the crisis would be resolved in the 18th century, with Spoorland being annexed\nby  Lorent  and  a  territorially  diminished Daxwell being made a Concord member, whith\nsome of the republic's territory being returned to Thílvis as a compromise.\n\nThis  would  be  part  of  a  wider tendency of the Concord to start looking outwards in the\n17th  century,  as  the colonial era came to a close in Noruin and the increased trade in the\nregion led to what is considered as the golden era of the Concord.\n\nThe   same  period  would  also  see  negociations  between  the  Concord  and  Saamiršes.\nHowever,  the  island  nation  would  eventually  decline  the  proposal,  and  cut  short the\nprocess of joining as attempts at reconciliation between the Saamiri and Zanlibi failed.\n\nDuring  the bankruptcy of the Deranne Trading Company, a Concord diplomat would offer\nmembership  to  the  DTC  as  an  alternative  to takeover by the magnates of the Northern\nLeague.  It  is,  even nowadays, unclear whether that official acted on his own, and whether\nthat proposal was official or not; nonetheless, the DTC would be entirely bought out by the\nmagnates a few days later."

Most giants don large beards and muscular physiques, wearing the\naged clothes and attire of aeons past.\n\n==History==\n===Origins===\n====In Cannorian Myth====\nAccording  to  the  Cannorian  Pantheon  the  giants  as  well  as the genies were the initial\nservants and creations of the Primordials and fought for their respective creators during the\nPrimordial Wars against Castellos and his siblings.\n\nAfter  the primordial defeat, the giants, along with the genies and the newly created dragons\nhelped  the  gods  mould and shape the earth. By the outbreak of the Godswar amongst the\ngods  the  giants  were  split with some favouring Castellos and others favouring his brother\nAgrados.  With  the  end  of  the  war  and the Godly Decrees in place the gods left for the\nheavens and left their creations to their own vices, leaving the dragons to rule the skies, the\ngenies  to  rule  the sands and oceans and the giants to rule the land and mountains in their\nstead.  It  is said that those that favoured Agrados were banished to the hells along with the\ntraitorous gods and dragons, with giantsblood forming the basis of large demons.\n\nSome  suggest  that  one  of  the  reasons  of  the  Inheritance  War,  in  which  the dragons\nattempted  to  claim the divinity of the gods, was the fact that the dragon lineages were on a\nwar  of  annihilation  against  both  giant  and  geniekind.  With the draconic victory of the\nInheritance  War  the  giants  became  their foremost enemy and the two races warred upon\neach other for millenia upon millenia. This would be known as the War of Ages."

It is\nunknown  when  this  period  started  exactly,  but we do know that it ended around 12,000\nBA, which marked the end of the last ice age.\n\n====Realm of the Ice Giants====\nWith  the  breaking  of  draconic  rule  over  Halcann  the  giants and the remaining genies\npartitioned  the  lands  to themselves, with the frost giants of the north ruling over much of\nCannor  with  their monarch, the Frost King Gerud (which is also where the landmass gets\nits namesake).\n\nThe  Realm  of  the  Gerud  was  marked by its icy domain which back then stretched over\nmuch  of  northern  Cannor,  with  the  seas  of  the  Giant's  Grave  still  encased  in  ice.\nThroughout  their  domain  dotted  magnificent  palaces  of  pure  ice which caused this icy\nphenomenon.\n\n====Realm of the Cloud Giants====\nAnother  realm  that  still  exists  to  this  day  is  the  Realm of the Cloud Giants and their\nfloating   castles   on  clouds.

This proved catastrophic to the true giants, with many of them drowning in\nwhat is today known as the Giant's Grave Sea that lies to the south of Gerudia.\n\nAfter  this  period  the  true  giants  as a whole faded to obscurity, as it was said that a great\nmany  of  the  last  true  giants had gathered in Gerudia during the attack. Eventually, these\ngiants would be succeeded by their descendants, the Giantkin.\n\n==Varieties==\n*Ice  Giant:  the most well-known type of giant, had an empire thousands of years ago, and\ndrowned.\n*Cloud   Giant:  A  more  mysterious  type  of  giant  that  live  in  castles  in  the  clouds.\nOccasionally,  an  airship spots one of these castles. Whether they have any nations that are\nlarger  than  a  castle is up for debate, although there are increasing sites of a 'Palace in the\nSky' above the Uelos' Lament.\n*Fire  Giant:  An  almost  extinct,  at  least  on Halann, type of giant, pushed back to a few\nvolcanoes  across  the  world.  They  maintain cool relations with outsiders, but seem to be\nwilling to give magical knowledge that involves interplanar travel.\n*Stone  Giant:  Not  much  is  known  about  them.

The  end of her reign, and the support she received from nobles\nacross  the  lakes,  caused many cities to rise up and dispose of their monarchies, alongside\nbeginning   a   2000   year  long  distrust  of  mages,  which  would  last  until  the  Arcane\nPonderance.\n\n== Rise To Power ==\nThe  Tyrant Queen's rise to power was a bloody one, taking the throne after murdering her\nbrother,  who  had  himself  murdered  their  kinslaying father, before killing the rest of her\nfamily.  Sources  say  she did this to end the long cycle of dynastic violence that gripped her\nkingdom.  Her  early  reign  was  relatively  peaceful  but  as  she  aged  she would become\nobsessed   with   preserving   her   youth,  causing  her  to  grow  increasingly  drastic  with\nexperiments.\n\nShe  supposedly utilized and studied various different fields of both magic and science, with\nmany  believing  she  sought immortality. She was said to have sealed souls into homunculi\nof  her own people. Myth states that when this did not reveal a method for immortality, she\ninstead  went  to  war, conquering surrounding lands to gather both scholars and subjects to\ncontinue  her research. Modern historians conclude her conquests mostly took place in the\nWestern Heartlands and Eastern Brightmarches, due to their proximity near Narkel.\n\n== Fall ==\nAn  alliance  of cities had gathered to end her reign of terror, fighting through the streets of\nthe  City  of  Tyranny.  Although  she released her monsters to slow them down, the bloody\nsiege  burnt  her  city  to  the  ground. The monsters fled into the forest and the Queen was\nbelieved  to  have  died  in  the  fire,  though the lack of a body has caused her to become a\nboogeyman  in  the  lakes.  Many  of  the  survivors  from her city went to found the city of\nNarkel."

 page_events.2853.d: "\n\nThe  City  of  Narkel  would  continue the magical legacy of the City of Tyranny with their\nMagic  Academy,  the  widespread  trauma  caused  by  the  Tyrant  Queen’s  rule led to the\ncreation  of  a new institutional force to heavily monitor all mages in fear that a new Tyrant\nwould  ever  rise  to  power again, the Onyxguard. The Onyxguard would remain in Narkel\nfor  millenia,  until  the  start  of  the  Arcane  Ponderance  in  1572,  and  the  subsequent\nwidespread  implementation and expansion of the Onyxguard across the Lake Federation in\n1576.\n\n== Modern Theories and Analysis ==\nModern  scholars  both  within  and outside of Kalsyto have developed several explanations\nand  theories  for  both  her  magical abilities as well as her personal beliefs and goals. The\nmost  popular  widely  accepted explanation by the Trinic peoples for her immense magical\nability  as  was  that  she  was  a  follower  of  Hucaubisti,  literally translating to “Worldly\nGods,”  one  of  if  not  the most ancient faith of the Triunic Lakes, that although replaced,\nstill  is  seen as respectable. Triunic historians explain Hucaubisti has been not one unified\nreligion,  but  a  collection  of  popular  accepted gods shared by the ancient peoples of the\nForbidden  Plains  now known as the Zabatlari. Of particular importance was the Goddess\nSoiti,  the  goddess  of  Magic  and  Dreams,  who  is still present in the current Yudunyovi\nPantheon  of  the Orachav people, albeit with variations. Soiti was “the fifth grandparent of\nany  mage”, and was believed to “teach” mages their abilities through dreams. She was also\nwidely  worshipped  by  the  Zabatlari  peoples  at  the time, and was a common patron for\nevery  Zabatlari  mage. The Tyrant Queen herself is believed to have been the “grandchild”\nof  Soiti,  as  was  the  case  for  any  Zabatlari mage. It was also noted she had other mage\nsiblings,  however  none were said to be nearly as powerful or skilled as her. In spite of the\nancient  nature  of  her  existence,  all Triunic accounts record her “surname" as N’potsoit,\nmarking  her  status  as  a  mage  and therefore "Grandchild” of Soiti. Her given name was\nuncovered in official documents long hidden in the Narkel Academy of Magic.\n\nModern  scholars  also  widely  believe she primarily utilized Transmutation, Enchantment,\nand  Illusion  based magic, owing to the recorded scale and size of her conquests, as well as\ndescriptions  of  her  homunculi, “flesh monsters,” and supposed mass coercion of scholars\nand  other  mages.  Both  Triunic  and  outside  historians  theorize  that due to her unseen\nmagical  potential  and  abilities  which would have lasting consequences for two millennia,\nshe  could have possibly been one of if not the most powerful human mage prior to the Day\nof Ashen Skies, although this topic is widely debated."
 page_events.2854.t: "Tyrant Queen 3 / 3"
 page_events.2854.d: "\n\nHer  supposed  obsession  and  mass  utilization  of  Transmutation  magic are of particular\ninterest  to  many  scholars,  both  inside  and  outside of the Forbidden Plains. All proven\nsuccessful  methods of achieving immortality to various degrees using innate magical ability\nhave  always  involved  the  practice  and  heavy  application  of  Necromancy, with turning\noneself  into  a  Lich,  such as with Canrec the Defiler. The attempt to achieve immortality\nutilizing  Transmutation  however  is  an  incredibly unique process, as while contemporary\nmages,  both  institutional and independent, agree that it is not entirely “impossible,” it has\nnever  been  seen  before in history. This has led some to believe that the Tyrant Queen has\nachieved  immortality  through Transmutation, although this is widely disregarded as myth,\nand  numerous  investigations  into the woodlands of the Central Lakes over millennia have\nconcluded no evidence of her continued existence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Following  the war, Eustace and his men\nwould  be  recognized  as  rulers  of  Minsford  with  the  Treaty  of  Anbenncóst,  the land\nhenceforth renamed the County of Uelaire.\n\nDue to the naval nature of the mercenaries, the first Uelairey settlements remained close to\nthe  shore  of  the  Dameshead  or  along  the  banks of the Minsroy River. Further inland,\nsettlers  met  a  quiet  but  hostile resistance from the Oakfoots, who would wage a guerilla\nwar  upon  them: ambushes, traps, poisonings, all to drive the stubborn Uelairey away. The\nnewcomers  would  hold  their  own,  but a constant sense of vigilance and general mistrust\ngrew within the people.\n\nThe   Decade   of  Masks  saw  the  county  face  a  plot  from  Vertesk  to  undermine  the\nthen-Count  Castén  I  síl  Uelaire.  The  aftermath  of  its uncovering, which included the\ncreation  of  the  Wardens of the Storm, drastically reduced merchant ship traffic as well as\nthe  flow  of  people  and  ideas  in  and  out  of  Uelaire,  cutting it off from developments\nelsewhere.

To  that  end, they trust no one but themselves, expecting neither\noaths   nor   promises   to   not  be  broken.  In  relying  solely  upon  oneself,  they  value\nself-sufficiency   and   independence   to   a   greater   degree   than   anyone   else   in  the\nEmpire—every  Uelairey man and woman is taught how to fish to feed themselves.

Men and\nwomen  alike  sport  naval  wear  in  daily fashion, dyed often in shades of aquamarine and\ndark teal. Though a maritime nation, the Uelairey do not consider themselves a mercantile\none  as  they  regard  merchants  as  parasites.  Instead,  they  honor  their  founder’s legacy\nthrough  study  of  the  ''Codex  Navius'',  Eustace síl Uelaire’s compendium of tactics and\nobservations  made  during the Battle of the Damesteeth. This document is the basis for all\nUelairey captains’ training.\n\nDespite  worshiping  the  Cannorian  Pantheon,  the  Uelairey  also  revere  the Primordial\nUelos,  who  is  said  to  have  created the waters of the world. His local priestesses are the\nStorm  Maidens,  who  see  sailors  off  to  war  with  hymns to grant them courage and the\nPrimordial’s  blessing.

 page_events.1523.d: "\nVampires  are  a  type  of  undead  that  fed  on the blood and were extremely vulnerable to\nsunlight.  Myths  suggest  the  first vampires were knights of the Aldresian Crusade who, in\ntheir  envy of the elves' longevity and their relative immunity to the White Pestilence, were\ncursed  by the gods after desecrating an elven temple. However, darker theories say that the\nfirst  vampire  was  in  fact Ettalinde the Wretched, who was cursed after trying to trick the\nInfernal  Court,  who  then  either  willingly or forcibly turned the crusaders who woke her\nfrom her tomb.\n\nFor the eastern variant of vampire, the energy vampire, see Jiangshi.\n\n==History==\n===Origins - Surael's Damnation===\nUp  until  the 17th century it was believed that the first vampires were crusaders (mostly of\nRoilsardi  origin)  who,  upon  seeing  the  end  of  the White Pestilence (1040-1053) that\nravaged  Corvuria  and  The Borders began to settle the depopulated lands as its new lords.\nSince   the   War   of   the   Sorcerer-King  Corvuria  had  been  known  as  the  Corvurian\nProtectorate,  which  was  a  vassal  state  of  the Phoenix Empire where sun elves ruled the\ngoverned  the  Corvurian population. After the Aldresian Crusade, however, Jaher gave the\nhuman  Roilsardi  knight  and hero of the crusade, Lucian síl Vivin the title of Protector of\nCorvuria, becoming the first non-elf to hold such a title.\n\nCorvuria  was  divided culturally and racially between the native Corvurians, who saw their\norigins  as  a  mix  of  the  old  Korbarid  tribes and Castanorians, the crusaders, who were\nlargely of Roilsardi descent, and the remaining sun elves who settled the land under Jaher's\nrule. Despite Lucian's loyalty to the Phoenix Empire and focus on restoring the land in the\naftermath  of the White Pestilence, many former crusaders began to grow deep envy for the\nsun  elves  who  still  saw  themselves  as  the ruling class of Corvuria. Pogroms against the\nelves  grew  and  Lucian  was  said  to  have  turned  a  blind  eye  to  the  atrocities, which\nculminated  in  a  desecration of an elven temple to Surael in Corvuria. The myth goes that\nSurael  then  cursed the envious crusaders with vampirism, forever to shun his sunlight and\nfeed on mortal flesh in exchange for a perverted version of the immortality they craved."

The  story goes that Ettalinde\nduring  her  time  as  an  acolyte tricked the fiendish gods of the Infernal Court by creating\nwarlock  contracts  exchanging  allegiance  for  power  without  each  of  the gods knowing.\nEventually  the  Infernal  Court  found out and each dealt a curse onto her which made her\nthe  first  vampire,  inadvertedly  saving her from being destroyed by the Sorcerer-King and\nCanrec the Defiler.\n\nIn  an  Order  of  Chroniclers  interview  with the Errant Theodore sína Trinás in 1900, he\nclaims  that  he and his fellow Errant-Princes were investigating the rumours of her survival\nin  their  search  for  immortality,  having grown envious of the long-livedness of elven life,\nand  that  they  found  Ettalinde's  tomb  underneath a temple of Surael in Corvuria. When\nrefused  entry  by  the  monastic  order  that lived in the temple, they slaughtered everyone,\neventually  waking  a slumbering and weakened Ettalinde. Ettalinde then broke free and fed\non  crusader  and elven monk alike until she was finally satiated, offering Theodore and the\nwould-be Errant-Princes her dark gift in exchange for freeing her.\n\nFor  individual reasons, the Errant-Princes swore secrecy, allowing various theories of their\nexistence,  like  the  popular  Surael's  Damnation,  to  fester  as they grew their individual\nvampiric covens and kin.\n\nAs   for  Ettalinde,  Theodore  claims  she  had  been  living  in  relative  secrecy  and  was\nuninvolved  in  vampiric  affairs  until  the 1800s, when the Blood Court, the international\norganization that governs mainstream vampiredom, captured and imprisoned her for fear of\nthe  Law of the First Sire, which claimed that if Ettalinde was killed, that her children, that\nis, all vampires, would die."

Other weaknesses though, they differ\ndependent  on  the  generation  of  the  vampire.  Second  generation  vampires  are said to\ngruesomely  [https://youtu.be/fmEPwrHlwXs?t=134 die instantly on contact] with sunlight\nvia  combustion, bursting into flames and disintegrating. Third and fourth however, merely\n[https://youtu.be/JxZHAMfuwsA?t=72  ignite  and  burn  on  contact with sunlight], dying\nwithin  a  minute  instead  of instantly. Progressing onwards, fifth and sixth do not combust\nimmediately  like  the prior generations, but instead burn on contact with sunlight and over\na minute of exposure will cause combustion. The last recorded change is in the seventh and\neighth  who  never  combust,  but [https://youtu.be/H1iXIekPjdo?t=180 can still burn to a\ncrisp  from  sunlight  through  prolonged  exposure],  and catch on fire although it's not all\nconsuming  like  the  others. Chronicler Chroné of Logis first noted this intriguing trend of\ngrowing  less  sensitive  to  sunlight  going  in  tandem  with  the  fact  that only the second\ngeneration  are  unable  to cross running water, and only the second and third are unable to\nenter  residencies  without  permission. This seems to suggest that the diminishing physical\npowers of vampires are traded off for their diminishing weaknesses."
 page_events.2862.t: "Vampire 4 / 9"
 page_events.2862.d: "\n\n==Feeding==\nVampires  can  only  sustain  themselves,  and their mind, by consuming blood. A vampire\nwho  does  not  feed,  whether  by choice or by inability, will eventually enter a state where\nthey  become  more  beast  than  man,  reverting  to  bestial  instincts  and  thinking - these\nindividuals   are  known  as  feral  vampires.  Should  they  consume  enough  blood,  feral\nvampires can still return to their former state.\n\nThere  have  been  attempts  in the past to commercialize the need for blood, such as blood\nbanks  or  a  coterie  of  thralls  to  feed  from.  To the disappointment of many a vampire,\ndrinking blood this way for a currently unexplained reason is less filling and nourishing to a\nvampire's  thirst  than  blood gained from a hunt. Research into this area indicates the hunt\nitself is necessary, making the predatory part of their nature critical to their survival.\n\n==Vulnerabilities==\nThere  are  only  2  confirmed  methods  by  which  a  vampire  can  be  killed (as they are\nnaturally  immortal):  exposure  to direct sunlight and staking them through the heart while\nthey  are  resting in their coffin. Staking a vampire through the heart whilst they are outside\ntheir  coffin  will  not  be  lethal  but  will  paralyze  the vampire. A vampire who has been\ngreatly wounded will enter a mist state, and return to their coffin to heal. The vampire will\nbe unable to leave the coffin until fully healed from this wound, this is also the only place a\nvampire can recover from fatigue and rest.\n\nThe  final  method,  although  unconfirmed,  revolves  around  the Sire Bond Theory. This\ntheory, derived from a compilation of ancient adventuring reports, states that the death of a\nsecond  generation  vampire  will  result  in  the  extinction  of  their descendants. Primary\ndebates  surrounding this theory include whether the death of the progenitor vampire would\nmean the death of vampirism, whether this is a second generation power, or whether this is\na weakness that has emerged in later generations.\n"
 page_events.2863.t: "Vampire 5 / 9"
 page_events.2863.d: "\nVampires  have  two  supernatural  impulses  that forbid them from acting. One is crossing\nrunning  water,  which  they  cannot do unless on top of a vessel like a boat, or the water is\ncovered  (such  as  by  a  bridge)  - though the water itself does not harm the vampire. The\nother is entering a person's residence without permission.\n\nThe  most  powerful  vampires  have  the  natural  ability  to charm people in a fashion not\ndissimilar to enchantment magic. This ability is not all-powerful, some people can resist or\nbreak  free  of  this  spell, and subjects cannot be forced to harm themselves or do anything\nthey  wouldn't  do  normally without risking of breaking the charm, like basic enchantment\nmagic.\n\n===Feral Vampires===\n\n==Creation==\nThe  creation  of  a  vampire  is  called  ''siring'',  where  the vampire creating is called the\n''sire'' and the vampire created is called the ''child''.\n\n* To create a new vampire one must drain the child of blood to near-death,\n*  then  feed the child a substantial portion of the sire's blood until the child passes out (in\nreality, this is the child dying)\n*  eventually  (usually  the  next  day)  the  child  will  wake, slowly gaining the powers and\nvulnerabilities of a vampire over a period of around a week\n*  if  the  child  does  not  feed  themselves  on  enough fresh blood straight from their prey\nduring this period, they will turn into feral vampires\n\n===Sire-bond===\nThe  bond  between sire and child is often extremely close, like the bond between family or\nlovers.  Indeed, it is expected by vampire society that the sire teach the child how to live as\na vampire and within vampire rules, as a parent would with their actual child.\n"
 page_events.2864.t: "Vampire 6 / 9"
 page_events.2864.d: "\nThe  bond  is  also  physical  and mental, and depending on the child's personal willpower,\nwill  form  a  strong  attachment and subservience to their sire and are unable to act against\ntheir  sire's  wishes or commands until they grow stronger in their abilities - which síl Vekt\nmarks  as usually under a decade. However, the sire will still ''always'' have sway with their\nchildren  and  their sires, and thus the entire sireline - though how much sway is dependant\non   the   sire's   personal   strength   and   degrees  of  separation.  On  one  occasion,  the\nErrant-Prince   Mihaela  prevented  her  own  assassination  planned  by  her  own  sireline\nthrough force of will, rendering her attackers unconscious.\n\n===Generations===\n\nGenerations   determine  how  far  removed  a  vampire  is  from  the  progenitor  vampire\nEttalinde.  When  a  vampire sires a new vampire, their generation is one higher from their\nparent (so a 3rd Generation's children will all be of the 4th Generation).\n\nThe older a vampire is, the stronger they are, but their generation acts as síl Vekt describes\nas  a  "maximum  potential" for their powers. While a vampire’s generation may determine\nthe  maximum  potential  for  their  vampiric  powers,  the  rate  at  which  they  meet  that\npotentially  varies  from vampire to vampire. Besides generations, vampiric power can only\nbe  increased  through  age.  As such, though a 500 year old 3rd gen may be stronger than a\nnewborn  2nd gen, a 500 year old 2nd gen will be significantly stronger than a 500 year old\n3rd gen.\n\n===Thralls===\nVampire  thralls  are mortal servants of vampires who are subservient to their masters. The\nmost common way is through long-term usage of a vampire's innate abilities that work akin\nto  enchantment,  but  the  alternate  way is similar to the creation of new vampires: that of\nfeeding on a vampire's blood.\n\nKnown  as  blood  thralls, or just thralls, these are mortals who have received portions of a\nfully-fledged  vampire’s  blood.  Depending  on  the  thrall’s willpower, this can become an\naddiction  upon  the  first  taste whereas for others it takes a few feedings. These thralls can\nsometimes  be  given  limited powers such as regeneration and enhanced senses in exchange\nfor  a  high  sensitivity  to  sunlight, but not death like their masters. Should the thrall stop\nreceiving   feedings   for   a   week,  they  will  go  through  intense  withdrawals  becoming\nunfathomably ill, which often leads to death if untreated."

In Aelantir, the landowners of\nMarlliande  have  been theorized to be vampire slave-owners, feeding off their orcish slaves\nfree from the purview of the old world of vampires in Cannor.\n\n===Fundamental Laws===\nWith  the  exception  of  feral  vampires,  and  a few outcasts, most vampires are organized\nunder  the  Masquerade.  The  Masquerade  has a single purposes: to keep vampires secret\nfrom mortals and keep them safe from harm.\n\nThe  following rules are those that appear most commonly amongst vampires, however they\nhave been known to vary regionally:\n\n# Vampires should not, in any way, let their vampiric nature be known to mortals.\n#  Obeying  a  Sire,  the  vampire  who  created  you,  and  the  local vampiric authority, is\nparamount.\n#  Creation  of  new  vampires can only be done with the consent of your sire and the local\nvampiric  authority,  and  should  a  vampire  choose  to  sire  a  new vampire they are held\naccountable for their actions.\n#  Destruction  of a fellow vampire is forbidden without the explicit permission of the local\nleader of the vampiric authority.\n\nWhat  constitutes  a  "vampiric  authority"  can  vary greatly across vampiric communities,\nsome  find  themselves  organized  under  a  single,  or  multiple,  vampiric lords who hold\nauthority  over  all  vampires within the community, while others fall under the authority of\nthe Blood Court.\n"

With  Steelhyl  and  their  land  in Vanbury, the family soon\nbecame  known  for  their  metalworking  skills  across Cannor. After exile from Gawed in\n1170  due  to  the  Greatwood  Uprising,  the  family  became  split  between  Steelhyl and\nLorent,   eventually  reuniting  to  found  the  Vanbury  Guild.  The  Vanbury  Guild  later\nexpanded in 1363 with Lorent granting them the County of Telgeir, meaning "Foundry" in\nElven, to Tristan I of Vanbury after his efforts in the Lilac Wars.\n\nWith  the  Vanbury Guild prospering, the Vanbury family expanded with the establishment\nof  foundries  across  Cannor  in  the  cities of Anbenncóst and Damescrown in later years.\nBeyond  Cannor, the Vanbury Guild established an Aelantir Chapter in 1517 on the island\nof  Vanburia due to rumors of Precursor artifacts in the region. The steel forged from these\nartifacts  allowed  the  Vanbury  Guild to assemble powerful muskets beyond the quality of\ntheir foundries in Cannor.\n\nThe  Vanbury  School  of Metallurgy was established in Anbenncóst in 1611 to provide the\nexchange  of  techniques  and  ideas  across  Cannor to further the influence of the Vanbury\nGuild  over  all  steelworks  industries. By the 1700s, the VG Musket became the standard\nand  had  widespread  popularity  around  the world from Aelantir to Haless, which further\ncemented their hold on global steelworks.\n\n==Notable Chapters==\n* Steelhyl: First major foundry, destroyed during the Greentide in 1424.\n* Telgeir: Established in 1363, it is currently the main hub of the Vanbury Guild."

''When investigating, or dealing with the Verdant Veil in any manner, there\nare a number of key things to keep in mind to preserve yourself.''\n\n*''The  Verdant  Veil  is  an  invisible force, acting as bridge and border between the Prime\nMaterial  and  the  Feyrealm.

Practice caution.''\n\n\n=== Historical ===\nThe  behavior  the Veil seemed have been more encompassing prior to 1443. This is based\noff the anecdotal evidence given in ''Planar Realms and the Ruin of Aelantir'' by Rothomar\nthe  Wise  (1645),  edited and compiled by Sofia síl Verne (1894). The following is taken\nfrom  síl  Verne's  compilation:''It  is  noted that, just like today, any creature native to our\nplane  could  enter  the  Deepwoods.  The  key difference was that doing so would result in\nthat  creature  passing  through  the  Verdent  Veil. In doing so, such a creature would find\nitself  in  the  Feyrealm but with no guarantee of where it would be in the Feyrealm. It was\nentirely  possible for this creature to enter into the Feyrealm's version of the Deepwoods or\nsome  elsewhere  entirely.  It  seemed  to  be  nothing  more  than  pure  chance.  The  key\nexception  to  this  was  if  there  was  the  intervention of a more powerful fey, typically an\narchfey.

As a result, most efforts had ended by the\ntime  of  Arun Drennen's attempts. Rather than attempt to tear down the Veil by force, the\nDrennen  mage  instead  attempted  to  understand  it  and  its  source.  In  by doing so, he\ndiscovered the Eldest in 1429. At first, Arun and his apprentice Eledas Cenág attempted to\nnegotiate with the archfey, as in accordance to Fey Court traditions. Unfortunately, the cost\nof  maintaining  the  Veil  had  resulted  in  hollowing  of  the  Eldest's  lifeforce, leaving it\nnothing  more  than  a  feral  husk.  As  a result, Arun was severely wounded and amnesiac\nwhile Eledas was killed.\n\nIt  would  be  over  a  decade  later  before  Arun  attempted  to  face  the  Eldest again. In\naccordance to his memoirs, Arun had spent much of this time recovering his memories and\nattempting  to  find  a  solution to deal with the mindless archfey. In the end, he concluded\nthat  only  slaying  the Eldest would put an end to the Verdant Veil and free the Deepwoods\ninhabitants.  Unfortunately,  few  mortals  were  capable  of  facing  an archfey directly and\nliving. And none were capable of killing one.\n\nAt  the  time,  only  another  archfey  could  meet  the task. But archfey did not fight other\narchfey directly, making that solution impossible.\n\nHearing  of  the  Conclave  of  Elynáile, Arun hoped that the conference to unite the Wood\nElves could also lead to Elvenkind finding the strength to face the Eldest as well. However,\nas  a  wanted  man for the believed murder of his apprentice, he could only work to try and\nsubtly  affect  the  dialogue.  His  plans  changed  with  the arrival of Corin and her circle.\nRecognizing  the  avatar's  incredible  power,  he  realized  that this unexpected human had\npotential to do what no one else could in the entire Deepwoods.\n\nWhen  a  scuffle  nearly  broke  out between the Wood Elven leadership and Corin's party,\nArun  intervened  with  a  risky  teleportation spell and whisked Corin and her companions\naway.  He  then  explained  himself,  the  Verdant  Veil,  and  the Eldest to the party before\npleading  to Corin for her aid. To his surprise, Corin readily agreed. After securing the aid\nhis  estranged nieces to help the party Elynáile, the party then set off to face the Eldest once\nmore.  Along  the  way, they met by the warlock goblin Oubblig. Despite the misgivings by\nher  party  members,  Corin  was  convinced  to  allow the Forest Goblin to join due to his\nstaunch opposition to the Greentide."

After the start of the Dragonwake and the foundation of the\nSmall  Kingdom  in 478, it was the natural choice for the relocation of the capital once the\nkingdom's  needs  outgrew  the  old  capital  of  Barrowshire.

These defenses were tested and fell in\nthe  Siege of Viswall (993-994) during the invasion of Lencenor, and the city was occupied\nby  Black  Castanorian  forces.  In  1001,  Mafalda the Mad was assassinated in the city by\nTaranath  Seerslayer,  sparking  the  liberation  of  the  city  under Lorentish protection and\nstriking blow to Black Castanorian hopes of re-invading Lencenor.\n\n===The Kingdom of Viswall===\nIn  the  aftermath  of  the  Sorceror-King's  defeat  in  1021,  the  Hillfoot  Halflings  were\nguaranteed  their own lands under the new Kingdom of Viswall with the eponymous city as\nits  capital.

Its expanded city walls and status as capital\nwould draw in migrants from all over the Small Country; this coupled with halfling fertility\nwould  lead  to Viswall quickly rivaling Beepeck as the most populous and preeminent city\nin the region."

The  feud  would  lead to one enterprising king linking the two buildings in the\nconstruction  of  the  Rainbow  Hall,  a  governmental complex built atop an arched bridge\nfrom which the city and the Kingdom were governed.\n\nDespite  the  initial  period  of  prosperity, Viswall's fate was tied to the rapid decline of its\nkingdom. Its political weakness would be used by Gawed and Lorent to foment secessionist\nmovements  and  break  away  smaller  states  who would then fall under their vassalage. As\nthese  outer  provinces  fell  away  to  hostile  powers,  trade  and  immigration  to  Viswall\nstagnated  while  its rival Beepeck had no compunctions dealing with the two great powers,\nallowing the latter city to surpass it in wealth and size.\n\n===The Free City of Viswall===\nThe  loss  of their last hinterland in the Fifth Tall War in 1067 would push the city council\nof  Viswall  to  coup  against  the ruling house, resulting in the fall of the Kingdom and the\ncreation  of  the  Free  City  of  Viswall.  While  culturally  remaining  open,  the free city\ndeclared  itself  permanently  neutral  and  thus  was politically isolated. The effect was the\ncontinued  decline  of  the  city  during  the  Interregnum  despite  the  Council's efforts to\nrevitalize  trade  and  local  industry;  only Viswall's continued near-monopoly on dyes and\npigments   for   Cannor   kept   it  from  falling  into  irrelevance.  The  isolation  from  its\nonce-hinterlands   would   also  cause  its  denizens'  culture  to  diverge,  resulting  in  the\nemergence of the Visfoots as a distinct people.\n\nThe city's fortunes would only begin to turn around following the First Lilac War in 1350.\nViswall's  neutrality  made  it  a  sanctuary  for  halfling refugees fleeing the war from both\nBluefoot  and  Redfoot  sides  of  the  Small  Country.  Rumors  of  Gawedi  and Lorentish\nweakness  combined  with  Viswall's  continued  existence  as  a  state  independent  of  the\nEmpire  made  notions  of  halfling  nationalism popular in the city among commoners and\nnobles  alike.  Additional  immigrants  during the Second and Third Lilac Wars revitalized\nthe  local  economy,  and  new  recruits  to  the  city's  Rainbow  Guard due to the growing\nViswaller pride added to the city's sense of security."

It  was  fought  between  three\nclaimants:\n\n* Varamel I, the Vyrekynn Emperor based in Arverynn.\n* Jearcad, a claimant based in Vareynn.\n* Trantan, a claimant based in Vysamsto.\n\nThe  war  is  divided  into a first, high-intensity phase from 1151 to 1154 which saw many\ngreat  fields  battles,  and  a stagnating phase from 1155 to 1205, where the contenders and\ntheir  successors  remained  at  war with one another but rarely fought, needing to focus on\ntheir home front and prevent their realms from collapsing.\n\n===Opening of Hostilities===\n\n\nIn  1151  Lord Jearcad rebelled against his relative Emperor Varamel I, laying claim to the\ntitle  of Emperor and rallying most of Dolindha behind himself. Lord Trantan also claimed\nemperorship  soon  after,  having  secured  the  support  of  Rzenta's  population and of the\nImperial soldiers stationed there. The region of Sarda remained loyal to Emperor Varamel,\nas the Ynnic Empire entered a state of three-way civil war between its three regions.\n\nThe  first confrontation of the war happened at the Battle of Bradatrvo between Jearcad and\nTrantan.  Trantan  was  decisively  defeated,  and  most of his Imperial soldiers defected to\nJearcad.  Trantan retreated with his remaining forces (mostly Rzentur warriors) towards his\ncapital  Vysamsto,  preparing  it  for  a  siege.

 page_events.1563.d: "\nThe  War  of the Ember Queens was a conflict between the kingdoms of Elizna and Irrliam\nbetween  1417  and  1420  about  domination  over  the Brasan Republic. While relatively\nshort, the war had massive consequences for the main belligerents, with Irrliam coming out\nthe  conflict  greatly weakened and Elizna almost severing relations with the other sun elven\nrealms.\n\n== History ==\n\n===Prelude===\nThe  root  of  the  conflict can be traced back to the Treaty of Gemisle of 1311, which saw\nBrasan  become  a  protectorate of Irrliam at the expanse of Elizna's ambitions. During the\nfollowing  century,  the  tensions  between  the  two  realms  were  exacerbated by opposing\nreligion  stances,  with Irrliam's ruler being the main advocator of a more hard-line version\nof  the  sun  cult while Elizna was promoting syncretic policies with its kheteratan subjects.\nThe  rivalry  on  the  personal level between the Eliznan queen - Zelaria - and the Irrliamic\nQueen - Imariel -, made diplomatic relations even colder.\n\nBrasan  quickly became the center point of the rivalry between Irrliam and Elizna, with the\nlatter often trying to meddle with the Brasanni elections. Elizna's efforts came to fruition in\n1417, when the high council of Brasan elected a pro-independence Rabsukal. After Irrliam\nunsuccessfully  attempted to remove the new Rabsukal, Brasan declared their independence\nwith Elizna’s backing, the war would officially start.\n\n=== Conflict===\nWith  its  troops  already  levied  before the start of the conflict, Queen Zelaria was able to\nadvance quickly through the unready Irrliamic territories. Her newly formed elite maritime\nshock  troops were able to seize the port of Anzabad only a few weeks after the beginning of\nthe  war.  Queen  Imariel Irrliazuir met the Eliznan forces near the confluence of the Suran\nand  the  Dasma,  but  despite  managing  to  inflict  heavy casualties on their enemies, her\noutnumbered troops were ultimately defeated. Mortally wounded during the battle, Imariel\nsuccumbed to her injuries after two days of agony."

Exacerbated by the gruesome fighting during the siege,\nand  a  century  of intense rivalry, the Eliznan commander was unable to control his troops,\nand  the  city  was  sacked with a level of brutality rarely seen before. The royal palace was\nraided  and the members of the Irrliazuir dynasty were viciously slaughtered. Only survived\nTaelarios  -  who was away on a diplomatic trip - and his grandson Thelrion, a one year old\ninfant who was hidden by a maid.\n\nThe  events of the Slaughter of Medurubar shocked the other Sun Elven rulers, particularly\nEledas  III  of  Sareyand  and  Arantir  I  of  Birzartanšes  who lost family members. Elizna\nsuffered  an  intense  backlash  and  multiple  countries  threatened to enter the war against\nthem,  which  forced Zelaria to sue for peace with Irrliam. Elizna ended up giving back the\ncontrol  of  the  cities  of  Medurubar  and Anzabad, but kept control of the other occupied\nterritories.  The  Brasani  Rabsukal  was  deposed  and  the  city  remained under Irrliamic\ninfluence, but obtained much more autonomy.\n\n===Aftermath and consequences===\nIrrliam  was  greatly  weakened  by the conflict. Their military was crushed, their capital of\nMedurubar   lay  in  shambles,  and  only  two  members  of  the  ruling  dynasty  survived.\nTaelarios  Irrliazuir  had  to  sit  back  on  the  throne  at  the old age of 356, 56 years after\nrelinquishing  it  to  his  daughter. His only heir, his grandson Thelrion, was only one year\nold and many decades away from being able to take the throne.\n\nWhile  the  war  was  a  military success for Elizna, it was a massive loss on the diplomatic\nside.   The   Slaughter   of  Medurubar  (and  their  religious  policies  in  a  lesser  extent)\ncompletely  isolated them from the rest of Bulwar and diplomatic pressures prevented them\nfrom obtaining their main objective when the war started: domination over Brasan."

In Rubyhold,\nthe  arrival  of  the  elves  was  initially  seen  in a positive light as a counter balance to the\nexpansion  of  Castanor beyond Escann. However, when it became clear that the elves were\nreplacing  many  dwarves  in  positions  of  influence,  this  led  to  what  is  known among\nhistorians as “The Long Sulk of Rubyhold” which ended only following the Lilac Wars.\n\nIn  Anvilwright,  the  war  is  held  as  the  event that finally transitioned the aspiring hold’s\nloyalty  from  Castanor to Dameria eventually leading to it joining the Empire of Anbennar\nunder the Grand Duchy of Esmaria where it was made an elector, representing the interests\nof  the  dwarven people. Further, the cooperation of Silverforge with the Ibenion’s forces in\nthe  Forlorn  Vale  led  to  the  adoption  of the moonfire symbol on the Silverforge coat of\narms.  The  Silver  Dwarves  also  helped  to  construct  the  capital of Ibevar following the\nrediscovery  of  Vardoced,  overseen  by  the  dwarven  architect Heharrûk. In exchange for\ntheir  aid,  Ibenion  named  the  river  flowing from Ibevar towards the Havoral Divide the\nHehaine after Heharrûk.\n\nAmong   Stone   Dwarves,   the   war  has  a  more  complicated  legacy.  The  role  of  the\nSorcerer-King  himself  is  downplayed  in  favor  of  a  resurgent Castanor claiming its lost\nglory,  only  for  the Castan to be betrayed and unjustly usurped. Without the steady rule of\nthe  last Castan, Castanor was broken by the Landing of Elves. In the aftermath of the war,\nmany  Stone  Dwarves  argued  in  favor  of  a  new  Castan  to take the throne of Castanor\ndespite  the  Trials  no  longer  being  accessible.  These calls were ignored and the ensuing\npower  vacuum  led  to  an  era  of petty kingdoms and feudal disputes among the successor\nstates.  Ultimately, they claim it was the breaking of Castanor that led to the destruction of\nEscann  during  the  Greentide,  followed  soon  after  by  the  religious  wars of Corin and\nAdean."

Since Ynnsmouth had embargoed the\nHigh  Havorics, Jahanon believed this war could help stabilize the financial situation of the\nrealm. The war involved almost every country in the Ynn with the exception of Tiru Móine\nand Balgabar, with Plumstead being involved in the southern campaigns.\n\n==March on Bosancovac==\nAfter  Jahanon’s consolidation of the realm, in the summer of 1795 he felt prepared enough\nand  decided  it  was  time to challenge the Dragon Dominion for hegemony. Most nations\nthat were not allied to High Havoral sided against it to contain Jahanon's expansion.\n\nBosancovac  was the first target of the war due to the strategic position as well as the wealth\nof  the  city,  and  thus  started  the Siege of the Floating City. The town was attacked using\nmany  pontoon bridges with elite groups such as the Paddleboard Knights on the side of the\ndefenders   while   High   Havoral  sent  Falah’s  Hunters  as  their  vanguard.

 page_events.1569.d: "\nThe  Wars  of  Rule  (1253 - 1284) was a turbulent period of conflict within the Empire of\nAnbennar  that  occurred  only  20  years  after  the  fledgling state's founding. It primarily\nconcerned  the  ruling  structure  of the empire, and whether the emperor should be a mage\nemperor,  neutral  to  the  political whims of Anbennar's many ruling dynasties, or whether\nthe  emperor  should  be one of noble, yet magical, blood - but ultimately one that is more\ninvested in rule than magic.\n\n==History==\n===Prelude===\nAfter  the  death  of  Delian  Whitecloak,  the  mage  responsible for founding Anbennar in\n1221,  and  the  short-lived  rule  of  Garion  the Wise (of Silgarion fame), the empire fell\nunder the rule of Mathos I. While he was not a bad emperor and remained impartial to the\nsquabblings  of  his  subjects and neighbours, Mathos did not have the reputation of Delian\nand  Garion  to  legitimize his rule - and was seen as a common magister who manipulated\nhis way onto the dove throne. His inactivity amongst his subjects led to the moniker of "the\nIdle",  as  Mathos  only  concerned himself with the bare minimum of rule, being far more\ninterested  in  the  study  of  magic.  For Mathos, as long as the realm was at peace and not\nstarving, that was enough. For the nobles of the realm, it was not.\n\nEventually  the  nobles,  primarily  from  those  of  larger states such as Dameria, Wex and\nArbaran  protested  the  rule  of  Mathos and refused to provide tax or levy to the Emperor,\ndemanding  Mathos to be more active in imperial politics in fear that the promising empire\nwould become stagnant in Cannorian affairs.\n\nThe  following  years were a time of half promises and general apathy on the situation from\nMathos,  who  left  much  of  the  ruling  to  other  members  of his court and even smaller\nnobility  who  had  more  to gain by allying with the emperor. This lasted until 1253 when\nthe  protesting  nobles  finally  raised  an army and stormed the tower of Aranthíl (which at\nthe  time  was  the  residence  of the emperors of Anbennar) to force him to abdicate but in\nthe end led to Mathos being slain."

 page_events.2901.d: "\n\nThe  Magisterium  then  elected  another  magister  named  Delian  with promises of more\ninvolvement (and perhaps hoping bearing the same name as the empire's founder would be\na  boon)  but  Delian  also  failed  to  impress  the  nobility  and  was  poisoned, becoming\nposthumously   as   Delian   Greentongue.   In   response  to  this,  the  nobles  elected  an\nanti-emperor  amongst  themselves,  with  Marion  Silmuna,  the Grand Duke of Dameria,\nrising to the role.\n\n===Start of the War and Aldarion Elventhrone===\nThe  war started proper when the elf Aldarian Elventhrone was elected, who was a powerful\nbattlemage  and  hero  during  the  War  of  the  Sorcerer  King.  Aldarian managed to oust\nMarion  and his Damerian forces from the Isle of Damesear, and secured the loyalty of the\nmetropolitan  Anbenncóst.  Aldarian  led  several  victories  during his rule, most famously\nsingle-handedly   destroying   the  stationed  imperial  navy  at  Neckcliffe,  who  had  been\nnominal  vassals  of Dameria. It was said that Neckcliffer lords did not even know of a war\nuntil it was too late.\n\nAldarian  quickly  moved  to  blockade the Eastern Dameshead, where Marion had fled to,\nand focused his efforts in securing the loyalty of the west. By 1256 Anbennar was in a state\nof  civil  war,  with  nobles  rallying to both factions. Larger realms such as Dameria, Wex,\nArannen  and  Esmaria  all  fought  against  Aldarian,  while  smaller  nobles  rallied to the\nEmperor.  Some nobles, who by de jure were bound to follow their overlord even used this\nto  break  free  and  become  an  independent  imperial  state, such as the Duchy of Verne,\nwhich seceded from Dameria in 1257.\n\nWhile   Aldarian   was   unstoppable   in  the  battlefield,  he  fell  to  subterfuge  and  was\nassassinated by in 1259.\n\n===Conflict under Gracos I===\nThe  Magisterium  then  elected  Gracos  I,  a  human apprentice of Aldarion, and also the\nuncle  of  the  Duke of Tretun. With his noble connections Gracos turned the war between\nnobles  and  mages  to  nobles  and nobles, and by 1262 the country was again at civil war.\nThis period was mired with prolonged conflict of all sizes, peaces, half-peaces and conflicts\nagain,  but  for  much  of  this  period both factions were at a stalemate. However, in 1275\nGracos  was  defeated  in  battle  and executed, leading to the unlikely election of Bilfiz the\nShort."

 page_events.2902.d: "\n\n===Imperial Intrigues===\nThe  gnome  Bilfiz  the Short was elected Emperor and eventually came to an uneasy peace\nwith  the  nobles  in  1277. Compromises on both sides were made: Damerian holdings in\nthe  mainland  were  largely restored except those that seceded like Verne, who were to stay\nfree  and  serve  the  emperor  directly  as  subjects. On the Isle of Damesear Dameria was\nforced  to surrender Damenath and surrounds to the Magisterium, and Anbenncóst became\na  free  city.  In  return,  taxes  were  reduced  and  the  Imperial  Parliament was officially\nfounded,  allowing  the  estates  of  the  realm to gather and advise the Emperor on worldly\naffairs.\n\nWhile  publically  the  realm  was  at peace, in reality the war continued in the north under\nthe  Marquis  of Arbaran Varil Silcalas, who, alongside his many followers which stretched\nfrom Damescrown to Esmaria continued their defiance of the emperor. In the Anbennarian\nheartlands the conflict moved to shadows, and Anbenncóst, the new capital by nature of the\nlocation of the Imperial Parliament, became centre of these intrigues.\n\nUnfortunately  for  Bilfiz,  he died of old age in 1284, and was succeeded by the elf Erelas,\nwho was a leader of pro-peace parties within the Magisterium.\n\n===Aftermath===\nThe  Wars  of  Rule  only ended with a sign of humility from Erelas the Humble, the newly\nelected  Mage  Emperor  of  Anbennar,  who  instead  abdicated  and  made peace with the\npro-noble   factions.  Together  they  signed  the  Treaty  of  Aranthíl  and  established  the\nConcordat  of  Rule,  splitting  the  sovereign  roles  of  Anbennar  into  two: with a Noble\nEmperor  (whom  still  had  to  show  magical  potential)  being elected by a newly formed\nelectorate  (which  included the Magisterium, who had been solely in control of succession\nbefore)  and  a  Grand  Magister  to  serve  as the Emperor's lead advisor. This allowed an\nEmperor  that  understood magic but had his priorities in diplomacy and ruling the people,\nand  a  Grand  Magister  that  could focus on magical pursuits in service of the Empire but\nalso  had  impact  on  the  political  scale.  With  this,  the  current  Noble Emperor, Varil\nSilcalas,  became  the  one  emperor  of Anbennar, and Erelas the Humble became the first\nGrand Magister."

Sometimes\ncompared  to  satyrs, they are far more malign, possessing an insatiable hunger for the flesh\nof  any living thing. A hunger which, in the worst cases, has resulted in entire villages being\nturned into boneyards smeared with the blood of their inhabitants overnight.\n\nYnnic Knights patrol villages to make sure these beasts don’t attack, and the bravest of them\ngo  to hunt wendigos. A knight who has slain a wendigo can fashion an antler helmet out of\nthe beast’s horns, a great sign of accomplishment to be worn with pride.\n\n== Origin ==\nWendigos  preyed  upon the northern Ynn for much of its history, having existed before the\nGreat  Ride  of  Lukaus.  Ynnic traditions blame the creation of Wendigos on an ambitious\nevil  wizard/mage  who,  after  escaping  the  Ending  Flood,  sought  to  recreate the sinful\ninhabitants of the world which the Ynn River had just cleansed. His creations, while at first\nbeautiful,  immortal  and  all-knowing,  were  struck by a curse, and became the horrifying\ncreatures known as Wendigos.\n\nAnother legend says that Wendigos were created after a group of Ruinborn Elves resorted to\nvile  and  heinous  cannibalism,  and  were  struck by a curse for that. In a variation of that\nlegend, the Ruinborn were cursed for eating the flesh of Antler Horses.\n\n== Wendigo Hunts ==\nThe  tradition  of  hunting Wendigos to fashion headwear out of their antlers is also ancient\nas the Ynn itself, as archeological findings show the crowns and helmets worn by the Antler\nLords of the second century after Ash.\n\n=== Hunt of Kril Ribnan ===\nThe  Hunt  of  Kril Ribnan in 250 is the biggest wendigo hunt recorded: the story goes that\nthe  Lordship  of  Stantirvare  and the Kingdom of Malacnar, caught in a territorial dispute\nover who should rule the territory past the Red Fork (near modern-day Mocbarja), decided\nto  move  war  not  on  one  another,  but  rather  send their fighters to search and hunt for\nwendigos  across  the  region,  with  the  side that killed the most becoming overlord of the\nconfluence.  It is said, after both sides had killed and piled a hundred wendigo skulls each,\na  Stantirvarey  rider  and  a  Malacnari  warrior  came  across  the  last  Wendigo as it laid\nwounded  on  the  ground,  and  so  they  started duelling over the right to kill him.

The wendigos, thus forced to\ncontend  with  the creatures of the river for their food, saw their numbers fall as they either\nstarved,   grew   more  careless  in  their  attacks  and  were  slain  by  village  watches  and\nadventurers,  or  suffered  the  same  fate  they  had once inflicted upon their victims at the\nhands - or jaws - of the river monsters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

As  such,  they  can be seen as a mixture of the two cultures.\nClosely related to their East Damerian cousins.\n\n== History ==\nWestern  Dameria  was  a  main  battleground  during  the  Lilac Wars. The Marquisate of\nWesdam  was  responsible  for  the  defense  of  the  region,  but  they  turned against their\nnominal overlords, the Grand Duchy of Dameria, for various reasons.

They are ambitious but\nnot as attached to worldly possessions, valuing useful skills or knowledge over coins. Being\na  borderland  between  Lorent  and  the Empire, they are more martially focused than East\nDamerians.

This  would  later  be  the  home  of  the\nHydiranyan  Harpies,  until  they  fled  back  towards the Harpy Hills to escape the Second\nGreat Cleansing.\n\nThe  second  migration  occured  in  790  BA,  with  several  harpy flocks migrating to and\nsettling  the  Khenak  Mountains  of Businor. This would later be the home of the Khenaki\nHarpies,  who  would  later  flee  to  the  Isle  of Tef, then to Akasik in order to escape the\nSecond Great Cleansing."

They  do not scorn jewellery or the finer things unlike their cousins however,\nprobably  due to the Anbennarian environment they are in; in fact, Wexonard armorers and\ntheir  style of gilding and design are immensely popular across Cannor, for those who want\na bit of flair to their armor, but not too much like the elven-styles of Anbennar/Lorent.\n\n==Society==\nThe  Wexonard  people  migrated  down to Anbennar some 1000 years ago but due to their\ninward  nature  have  kept  their  people  and culture all this time. Though they despise the\ncurrent  rulers  of  the  Alen: the Gawedi, who pushed them from their ancestral homeland\nlong  ago,  they  still  prefer  them  to  the  sometimes  pompous  nature  of Anbennarians.\nWexonards  due to their martial tendencies seem to value fencing as The Wexonard School\nof Fencing is an extremely prominent swordsman school with influence through Anbennar."

The\nrare  few  paths  I  see  bring  a  rebirth  of  virtue  and  good  will, but those are roads less\ntraveled.  Despite  this,  I’ve got the hope that the good people of Escann will put their foot\ndown,  refusing  to  let  evil  win,  as they have once before.”''This has been interpreted by\nmany  later  scholars  as  a  reference  to the Escanni Wars of Consolidation, the rise of the\nwitch kings as well as the Red Deluge during the Adeanic and Corinite war.\n\n\n==Legacy==\nHis  assistance was instrumental in Corin’s victory, and ascension to godhood.

The Wood Elven people descend from Moon Elves who entered into\nthe  Deepwoods  forest  while  retreating  from  an  engagement during War of the Sorcerer\nKing,  inadvertently  crossing  the  Verdant  Veil  and  entering  the  Feyrealm.  Due to the\nstrange  temporal  nature  of the Feyrealm, these Moon Elves would spend over a thousand\nyears  isolated  from  the rest of the world, limited to interacting only with Forest Goblins,\nFey,  and  each other. As result, by the Verdant Veil fell during the Greentide, Wood Elves\nhad grown to become culturally and biologically distinct from the rest of the elven people.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Moon Elf Progenitors ===\nThe  beginning  of  Wood  Elven  peoples is classically marked in the spring of 1017 in the\naftermath  of  the  Battle of Hornwood. The battle had ended in the tactical loss for League\nof  Free  Realms  forces  due to sudden and unexpected heavy downpours, rendering Moon\nElf  archers  and  allied  Free  Castanor  heavy  cavalry useless. Unable to regroup with the\nmain  army  due to poor visibility, Commander Liandiel Speardancer ordered her troops to\nwithdraw  and seek shelter in the nearby Deepwoods. In doing so, they crossed the Verdant\nVeil and left the Prime Material Plane.\n\nRecords  for  a period afterwards are sparse with little being known other than that Liandiel\nand other Moon Elf leaders seemingly became aware of their entrapment in the Deepwoods\nand made camp in what would become Ciranmyna.\n\nFor  following  decades, efforts to break through the Veil would be attempted on and off by\nthe  handful  of  accompanying  Moon Elf mages. During this time, the stranded Moon Elf\narmy,  under  the  orders  of  Liandiel, would steadily transform their makeshift camps into\nproper forts and settlements. Scouts, meanwhile, would begin to bring back reports of what\nthe elves would later learn were the Fey and Forest Goblins.\n"
 page_events.2913.t: "Wood Elf 2 / 5"
 page_events.2913.d: "\nInitial  relations  with  both groups began rocky. The Fey were frequently reported as fickle\nand  conniving  while  the  Forest Goblins were recorded as barbaric and hostile. Relations\nwith the Fey, however, would normalize to some end as various accords and understandings\nwere made, forming the basis of what the practices of the Fey Court. The relations with the\nForest  Goblins  would  remain less understanding, with a competitive rivalry forming over\ntime.\n\n=== Rise of the Salla ===\nAfter  a  century of living within the Deepwoods, the original Moon Elf army had given way\nto  an elven society that had largely come to terms with their new home. The consequences\nof this showed itself in several ways.\n\nThe  first  was  the  transformation  of  Liandiel  Speardancer’s  role. While still ostensibly\ncommander  of  the  elven  army,  her authority increasingly stemmed from seniority rather\nthan  rank,  especially  in  the  eyes  of  the  first generation of forest native elves who were\ncoming of age.\n\nIn  addition,  these  young  elves also began to treat the units that had made up the original\narmy as familial clans rather than regimented structures.\n\nThe  second  was  a steady build up of elven influence over the Deepwoods. As the soldiers\nand  other  members  of  the  army  formed  families, the search for more favorable land to\nsettle grew. Leveraging the Gladeways, as shown by some more friendly fey, the elves began\nto  explore and settle the various groves. In many places, like the Lake Grove, the result of\nthis  expansion  was  repeated  conflict with the existing Forest Goblin clans residing there,\ndiminishing that already faded goblin power over the woods.\n\nThe  final  consequence  would  be  the  end  of elven unity which came with the passing of\nSpeardancer,  a little under two hundred years after the Battle of Hornwood. As the second\ngeneration  of  elves  came  to  age, the context of the old army was largely lost. The world\noutside   the   Deepwoods   became   fantastical   stories   while   the  old  units  that  their\ngrandparents hailed from were now known as salla, or clans. In the place of commander of\nthe  army  (or  ''ceannasaí''  in  native  tongue)  came the ''ceann'' (f. ''ceanna'') meaning\nliterally  "head"  or  connotatively  "head  of" or "leader” who would lead their individual\nclan in place of the old commander."

However, after almost one thousand years after the\nfirst  Moon  Elves  had  entered  the  Deepwoods,  that  isolation  would come to an end as\norcish  raiders  from the Greentide crossed the Veil, ironically retreating from Escanni foes\njust like the Moon Elves once had.\n\nThese  initial  raiders  heralded what would be multiple waves of orcish incursions with the\nlast  resulting  in  the  destruction  of  several  ruling salla and nearly bringing a collapse to\nWood  Elf  civilization  as a whole. However, this traumatic moment would be the inciting\nevent  leading  to the eventual reunification of Deepwoods elvenkind and reconnection with\nthe outside world.\n\nAs  the  elven salla struggled against the invading orcs, Narawen Drennen of Salla Drennen\nwould  bring  together  a  conclave  at  Elynáile  to forge an alliance between the remaining\nclans.  Soon  after, Corin, the avatar of Agrados, and part of her circle would interrupt this\nconclave  as  a  part  of  her  search  for  aid against the Greentide in Escann. The resulting\nconfrontation  led  to  two  key  events.  The  first  was Corin and her allies setting out and\nstriking  down  an ancient archfey known as the Eldest, bringing down the Verdant Veil and\nreuniting  the  Deepwoods  with  Escann and beyond. The second was the reconciliation of\nthe  salla  leaders  after years of various strife and feuds resulting in an accord being struck,\nlater known as the Verdant Pact.\n\nWith  the  Wood  Elves  united  and  the path back to Escann freed thanks to the fall of the\nVerdant Veil, Corin would return with the aid she was looking for. The Greentide, in both\nEscann  and  the Deepwoods, would then fall apart with the death of Korgus Dookanson at\nher hands shortly after leaving the newly unified Wood Elves to begin attempting to reclaim\nthe Deepwoods."
 page_events.2915.t: "Wood Elf 4 / 5"
 page_events.2915.d: "\n\n== Society and Culture ==\nCompared to the other elves of the Remnant Fleet, who integrated into human society early\non,  the  initial  Wood  Elven  experience  was  a  frightening  one. They were isolated in a\nstrange  land  and  often  subservient  to  the  whims,  follies and tricks of the Fey all while\nfighting   off   all  manner  of  wild  beasts  and  hostile  flora.  This  combined  with  their\ndescendance from warriors and soldiers has led to Wood Elven society deeply rooting itself\nin community, family, and service.\n\n=== Salla ===\nDue  to this deep interdependence, clans, or 'salla' in their dialect have played a key role as\nthe  bedrock  of  Wood  Elven society. Most, if not all, social services and organized efforts\nsuch  as  child  rearing, infrastructure building and mutual defense first originated from the\nvarious  salla.  Indeed, the greatest of these salla, whose origins can largely be traced to the\noriginal  units  that  made  up  the  Moon  Elven  army,  even ruled over all of Wood Elven\ncivilization until the formation of Cyranvar.\n\nSuch  is  the prominence of salla that Wood Elven introductions start with identifying one’s\nsalla  before  even  mentioning one’s name. Because of this, one of the harshest non-capital\npunishments  in  Wood  Elven  law  is  the expulsion from one’s salla. The result leaves the\ncriminal quite literally stripped of a part of their identity in society.\n\n== Comparisons With Other Elves ==\nWood  Elves  are well known for having multiple biological distinctions from their Sun and\nMoon  Elf cousins. Studies and research have concluded the cause of this to be due to their\nunique  long  term  exposure  to  the Feyrealm and its magics, which is known to influence\nand change various living creatures. These influences, despite misconceptions, do not mean\nthat  Wood  Elves are fey or fey-marked. They, like their Ruinborn cousins, are definitively\nelves.\n"

The  average  Wood  Elf  is  expected to live approximately two hundred fifty\nyears as compared to the four hundred years of a Moon Elf or Sun Elf.\n\n=== Family Size and Fertility ===\nDue  to  a  combination  of  cultural  and  biological  differences,  the average Wood Elven\nfamily  tends  to  be  significantly larger families than other elves. On average, they tend to\nhave as many children over their lifespan as that of an average human.\n\n=== Magical Ability ===\nOf  the  eight  traditional  schools of magic, Wood Elves tend to have a more difficult time\ngrasping   and   mastering  six  of  these  schools  to  other  elves;  these  being  Abjuration,\nDivination,  Illusion,  Enchantment,  Evocation,  and Necromancy. While mastery can still\nbe achieved given time and persistence, Wood Elven mages, often known as druids, tend to\neschew  those  schools  in  favor  of  Conjugation  and  Transmutation,  whose  spells often\ncorrelate  with  the magics naturally found in the Feyrealm. As a result of this, traditionally\n“powerful mages'' tend to be a rarer sight in Wood Elven society.\n\n=== Digestion ===\nCapable  of  digesting  a  wide  array  of  plant  material  entirely unheard of to other races,\nWood  Elves  are  known for incorporating a range of otherwise inedible material from tree\nbark to various grasses to fruit rinds and husks.\n\n=== Detection of Fey ===\nWhile   connections   to   the   Feyrealm   exist   throughout   Halann,   they  are  typically\nundetectable  without  the  aid  of magic. Wood Elves however are capable of “sensing” fey\nand fey magic presence in the same way that other races might hear something approaching.\n\n"

 page_events.1598.d: "\nWyverns are a large winged lizard related to dragons, with the main difference that wyverns\nare  smaller  and  have  two legs and wings compared to the dragon's four legs. Wyverns do\nnot  possess greater intelligence like their draconic counterpart but they are known for their\npoisonous  barbed  tails.  Wyverns can appear as any colour, though browns to muddy reds\nare the most common.\n\nWyverns  were  once  commonly  seen  across the Khenak Range, though by the time of the\nLilac  Wars  there  were  nearing extinction until they were revived by the Duchy of Verne,\nwhose predecessors had once ridden them during the Age of Ashes.\n\n==As a mount==\nDuring  the  Kingdom  of  Verne,  before its conquest by the Kingdom of Dameria and the\nreduction of Verne to a vassal duchy, the wyvern riders were the pride of the Vernmen. The\nKingdom  itself  was  founded  by  the  first wyvern rider, Armoc Vernid, though it remains\ndisputed to this day whether the dynastic name of 'Vernid' derives from wyvern or is simply\nan amazing coincidence.\n\nWyverns  were  notoriously difficult to tame, the same traits that made them such desirable\nmounts  -  their  great  size, their extremely powerful poison, their sheer viciousness against\nperceived  enemies - also made them nearly impossible to truly domesticate. Only wyverns\nraised  directly  from  hatching  and  enchanted  by  mages  to view their future rider as kin\ncould reliably be trained, and the necessary enchantments were kept as a close secret by the\nroyal  mages  of  Verne.  Even with such enchantments, only a brave and driven rider could\nkeep  such  a  beast under control, with wyvern riders who lost their nerve commonly being\nthrown  off  and  devoured  by  their  own  mount  who now regarded them as prey, and the\nenchantments  only  worked  between  a  single  rider and a single wyvern. Such difficulties\nensured Verne never had that many wyvern riders, even in its prime.\n\nWith  their rarity and aggression towards each other preventing large-scale usage, as well as\ntheir  high  stamina  and  ability to digest nearly anything, wyverns were just as valuable for\nreconnaissance  as  for  battle,  granting  the  Vernman  a level of military intelligence only\nmages   skilled   in   divination   could   match.   Though  condemned  by  some  riders  as\ndishonorable,  others  also  found  the  wyvern  perfectly  suited  to raiding settlements and\nsupply  lines  deep  within  enemy territory, and such tactics brought terror to the people of\nthe river Luna during the wars between Dameria and Verne."

 page_events.2917.d: "\n\n==Wyvern Poison==\nThe  poison  of  the wyvern, more properly but rarely called wyvern venom, is unique in its\nsheer  destructiveness  to  organic  material,  destroying  its  structure  yet leaving the basic\norganic   materials  intact.  Extremely  potent,  wyvern  poison  burns  through  its  victim’s\nbloodstream, disintegrating veins and arteries on its way to the heart.\n\nThis  makes  it  of  supreme  usefulness  in alchemy, not only as the base for more complex\npoisons but also as the ultimate solvent of anything organic, and so the poison is frequently\nsought out by alchemists. It is speculated that the usefulness of wyvern poison played a role\nin  the  disappearance  of  wyvern rider during the period of Damerian control of Verne, as\nany  wyverns  discovered  would have been seen as more useful in alchemy than as a mount\nand thus slain. Additionally, the Hill gnoll tribes of the nearby Khenak Range are known to\ncoat  their  weapons  in  the  substance  when  they  can  and  may  have  contributed to the\ndisappearance of the wyvern.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Famous   for   conquering  Kheterata  and  Bulwar,  and  responsible  for  the\nCastanite  Exodus.  Their expansion was ended in the War of the Great Xhaz by Castan the\nProgenitor,  and  they  and  the Xhazobine was defeated in the First Great Cleansing which\nfollowed directly from the War of the Great Xhaz.\n*Draconic  Xhaz  (475  -  480):  also known as the Second Xhaz, dragon hysteria spread by\nfleeing Crodamic tribesmen who were fleeing through Businor saw local gnolls unite under\na  Xhazobine  and  attempt to invade the Damerian Republic, primarily The Borders. They\nwould  push  further  east, going through what is now the Forlorn Vale to reach Trialmount\nin order to serve the dragons they believed lived there. In the end, the Draconic Xhazobine\nwould be devoured whole by Zaamalot the Black, who had nested there.\n*Third  Xhaz  (666  -  669):  uniquely  united by a male gnoll, the Xhazobain. During this\ntime  a  good  portion  of  Bulwar  were ruled by the Gnollish Petty Kingdoms and as such\nmuch  of  the  Third  Xhaz  consisted  of  gnolls  of  lesser  status,  exiles or those driven to\nreligion  as  a way to counteract the "bulwarized" gnolls ruling over the humans. The Third\nXhaz  did not get very far into Cannor due to the efforts of the Korbarid Kingdom and Late\nCastan's  Empire, and was eventually stopped at a large cost by the Korbarid King Daravan\nthe  Malignant, who flooded much of his lands to create Daravan's Folly. While this killed\nthe  Xhazobain  and prevented any further gnollish excursions, the Korbarid Kingdom went\ninto  decline,  and  the gnollish survivors of the deluge remained into new marshland as the\nFlamemarked Gnolls.\n*Twin  Xhaz  (1240  -  1255): Born near the lands of the gnollish Kogs, the twin Xhaz was\nthe  result  of  a demon possessing two twin gnolls still in their mothers womb, eating their\nway  out and quickly growing adult sized months before their first birthday. They gathered a\ngreat  gnoll  host  and invaded Fanguala in the far west, During this invasion Fangaula only\ndefended  their  capital  province, leaving the border lands of their empire easy pickings for\nthe Gnoll horde. Eventually the Twin Xhaz was slain by a Ndurubu warrior in a great duel.\nThe  defeat  of the Twin Xhaz led to the loss of legitimacy of the demon worshiping faith to\nmany western Gnoll tribes, though it did pave the way to events that lead to the downfall of\nthe second Fangaula empire, with the earth Planetouched Banni murdering the royal family\ndue  to  anger  at  the  Twin Xhaz's forces having free reign of Fangaula border lands due to\nthe imperial army only being ordered to defend the imperial capital."

King Munaqir the Pious banned the worship of Antler Horses\nand the cult of ancestors (still practiced among ancient Ynnic Ruinborn) and stated that the\nYnn River is the one true deity while all creatures are merely the spawn of it.\n\nHis  successor  King Komerjon claimed before a battle that the Ynn River would carry only\nthe  brave to the afterlife. Despite this, Dolindhans at the time didn't practice water burial,\nbut  rather  mound-burial. It would only be in later times that water burial is introduced in\nDolindha from Sarda.\n\n====Rise of the River-Priests====\nWith  the  disbanding of Vareynn's Rider Assembly in the seventh century, a power vacuum\nwas  left among the Ynnic Empire's social classes. Ynnic river-priests stepped up to fill said\nvacuum, helping administer the realm and legitimize its rulers.\n\nReligion  would  play  an  important  role  in  Ynnic  society  for  the centuries to come, by\nhelping  keep  the Ynnic Empire together as one cohesive unit, and on a more local level as\nall  settlements  and  villages  across  the Ynn received the guidance and overseeing of local\nriver-priests."

The  council heralded the\nstandardization and centralization of religious practices across the Ynn.\n\nVelikvab  united  the  Sarda tradition of building barges to send deceased nobility down the\nriver  and  their myth of the End Flood together with the Dolindhan belief that they are the\nchosen people spared by a cataclysm for their virtue.\n\nThe council marks the beginning of the middle period of Ynn River Worship.\n\n====Councils and Heresies====\nYnn  River  Worship  became  further  standardized  during  the times of the Ynnic Empire\nthanks  to  an  ease  of  travel  and connections. Periodic councils would be held where the\ncommunity  of  faithful  tried  to  reach agreements over common matters: a large majority\nwas  needed  to  pass  a resolution and, once passed, those who continued to go against said\nresolution would be branded as heretics.\n\nHeretical  sects  and  secret  cults  such  as  the  Mun  Pienik  would develop to contest the\ndoctrine  espoused  by  mainstream  Ynnic  religion,  playing  a  part in the Ynnic Empire's\ncollapse.

 page_events.1614.t: "Ynnic Zodiac 1 / 4"
 page_events.1614.d: "\nThe  Ynnic  Zodiac  is part of the Ynn River Worship faith, based on the four-year cycle of\nthe  Ynn River, known as Stuir Balia, during which it swells for two years and contracts for\ntwo  years.  Historically,  monitoring  this  cycle  was  necessary for the maintenance of the\nGreat  Ynnic  Dams  as well as agriculture. The river is believed to be the source of all life\nand  so  each  Stuir  Balia  is  associated  with  one  of 16 animals in order. Together these\ncompose  one  64-year  Kyuvir  or  great  cycle. The Ynnic Zodiac calendar was formalized\nacross  the  Ynnic  Empire  from 640AA to 649AA along with standardizing the practices of\nYnn River Worship. It is also commonly believed in Ynnic River Worship that anyone who\nis born in the year of a certain animal is influenced by it.\n\n==Animals of the Zodiac==\nThe animals of the Zodiac arranged in order:\n\n===Antler Horse===\nThe  wild  horse  of  the  northern  Ynnic Forests characterized by its crown of antlers. The\nantler  lords  would  fashion  their  crowns  after  this  beast. Those born during the Antler\nHorse  Stuir  Balia  tend to be ordered in their manner and they make for righteous rulers.\nHowever, such rulers can often be seen as cruel in their distribution of justice.\n\n===Snapping Otter===\nKnown  for  its  elongated snout, the snapping otter is a very clever animal often trained for\nfishing  by  the  Sarda. Those born during the Snapping Otter Stuir Balia tend to be seen as\ngood-natured  towards  their  peers  and  are  likely  to  seek  new  business  opportunities.\nHowever, they can be found secreting money away for themselves despite their good nature.\n\n===Sabertooth Tiger===\nA  powerful  and  wily beast, Veykodans are known to tattoo large eyes on the back of their\nheads  to  ward  off  these  predators'  surprise attacks from behind. Those born during the\nSabertooth  Tiger Stuir Balia tend to be more outgoing, ready to 'conquer' their foes. They\nalso  make  for  bold combatants in the field. However, their diplomacy is lacking and they\nare likely to rush into a perceived advantage."
 page_events.2947.t: "Ynnic Zodiac 2 / 4"
 page_events.2947.d: "\n\n===Woolly Rhino===\nThis  beast  is  hunted  in  Veykoda  to  make bowstrings of its hair and to carve ornaments\nfrom  its  horn.  Such  artefacts  are  considered holy by the natives. Those born during the\nWoolly  Rhino  Stuir  Balia  tend  to  be more enduring than most, both in their values and\ntheir  morals.  However,  this  resistance  to  new  ideas  can  cause  them to be too sure of\nthemselves in unfamiliar territory.\n\n===Direwolf===\nSets  of  glowing  eyes  in  the  night,  direwolves stand as tall as a ruinborn elf on all fours,\nlarger  than  even a sabertooth tiger. Those born during the Direwolf Stuir Balia tend to be\ngood  at outmaneuvering their opponents and seeking out leadership positions. However, it\nis rare to find that such individuals wield their influence to selfless ends.\n\n===Giant Beaver===\nInhabitants  of  many  of the tributaries of the Ynn, giant beavers have been known to flood\nentire  villages  with  their dams. It is believed these animals inspired the first Ynnic dams.\nThose  born  during  the  Giant  Beaver  Stuir Balia tend to have a mind for building and a\nwork ethic to see projects to completion. However, in these pursuits, their visions often are\ninfluenced by a need to build personal wealth.\n\n===Ynnea Pig===\nBelieved  to  have  curative  and  fertility  properties  by proximity, the humble ynnea pig is\noften  kept  as  a  pet  by  the  upper classes of Sarda and Dolindha. Those born during the\nYnnea  Pig  Stuir  Balia  are  known  to be compassionate and like their animal counterpart\nwill  have many kids in their lifetime. However, they are not the most clever of individuals\nand will make a fool of themselves in social situations.\n\n===Four-Horned Sheep===\nA  staple  source  of food and wool and sturdy enough to be a pack animal, the four-horned\nsheep   was  the  first  animal  to  be  domesticated  in  the  Ynn.  Those  born  during  the\nFour-Horned  Sheep  Stuir  Balia will be more likely to be watchful of what they say and to\ntolerate  ideas  that  run  counter  to  theirs. However, this tendency not to fight back often\nleads to the perception of cravenhood."

 page_events.2948.d: "\n\n===Thunderbird===\nSaid  to  be  the  cause  of  lightning  and  born from thunderclouds, thunderbirds are large\nenough  to  lift  an  elf  and  can be found soaring above the Epednan Expanse. Those born\nduring  the  Thunderbird  Stuir Balia long to be free from the constraints of others and can\ntalk  themselves  out of most commitments. However, their arguments are often laced with\nmore truth than should be revealed\n\n===Whitetail Fox===\nYnnic  myth  states  that  the whitetail fox taught the elves how to rebuild their society after\nthe  great  flood. Their bushy tail is as large as their body. Those born during the Whitetail\nFox  Stuir  Balia  are  known  for  their  gregarious  attitude  towards  others, finding many\nopportunities  through  these  personal  connections.  However,  these opportunities can be\nsquandered due to losing sight of the bigger picture.\n\n===Poskawa Whale===\nAn ever-present danger along the Epednan Expanse and the Dalairey Range, the land whale\nambushes  travellers and has become a symbol of misfortune and instability across the Ynn.\nThose  born  during  the  Poskawa  Whale  Stuir  Balia share an ominous fate. Eleven is an\nunlucky   number   for  Ynnics  and  this  zodiac  can  be  taken  advantage  of  to  unnerve\nopponents. However, this only goes so far as this treacherous behaviour is seen as sinful.\n\n===Mishipeshu===\nSudden and deceptive, the aquatic panther of the Ynn river can take even the most seasoned\nfisherelf  by surprise. Constant vigilance is a must out on the water. Those born during the\nMishipeshu  Stuir  Balia tend to be adept at subterfuge and relentless in their pursuits often\nmaking  them  staunch  defenders  of  the faith. However, this zealousness does not prevent\nthem from succumbing to more base pleasures.\n\n===Stone Fish==="

Those born\nduring  the  Stone  Fish Stuir Balia are sturdy in all things, be it their view of leadership or\ntheir  commitment  to the procedure. However, a stiff tongue often leaves them wanting for\nthe right words.\n\n===Water Serpent===\nNo two are exactly alike so much so that some wonder if the water serpent is actually many\nkinds of beast. While some resemble large land snakes, others are too horrible to describe.\nThose  born  during  the Water Serpent Stuir Balia are known to take whatever position the\ncontext  calls  for  whether  they believe what they say or not. This can frequently give them\nthe  upper  hand  in  negotiations.  However,  this arbitrary nature can harm others without\nregard for their well-being.\n\n===Owlbeast===\nThe  Owlbeast is a creature of solemnity and might. Lacking wings, this bird walks on four\ntaloned  legs  and  though  it  is not usually violent, its beak can crack an elf's skull. Those\nborn  during  the  Owlbeast  Stuir  Balia live for scholarly pursuits which gives way to their\nesoteric  nature.  However,  this  preoccupation  with  the  abstract can distance them from\nfriends and lovers alike.\n\n===Dragon===\nWhether  feared or revered, the dragon is one of the most intelligent and powerful forces in\nall  the  world. Even so, the Alliance of Knightly Lords slew Drozmagog, proving that these\ncreatures are neither divine nor invincible. Those born during the Dragon Stuir Balia strive\nfor achievement. They make the most powerful mages and the best generals. However, this\nperpetual ladder climbing leaves them looking greedy in the eyes of others.\n\n\n"

A recently bitten victim can be administered a cure to prevent zombification, and\nmedical advancements have also increased survival rates of an untreated plague victim also.\n\nThe  great  danger  lies  on  the  discovery  or  creation of an unknown strain of the zombie\nplague, one that Garion's work cannot be easily applied to.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Stymied  by gnomish disregard for\nkobolds’  abilities  in  the  early  days of the Second Hierarchy, he and his followers left the\ncountry wholesale and founded Zurzumexia in Haraf. His advances in biomodification sent\nshockwaves  throughout  artificery,  especially  once  neighboring Gommoport encountered\nthem,  and  while  he would not live to see the Triarchy formed, he is considered one of its\nspiritual founders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
