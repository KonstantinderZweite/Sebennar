 eztarthul_hunt:0 "Eztarthul Hunt"
 eztarthul_hunt_desc:0 "Eztarthul Hunt is the hunt for all the scattered pieces of the dragon. What was once whole must be rebuilt and for that to happen we must conquer all these provinces to remake our god."

 Z3Z_removing_the_harpies_title:0 "Removing the Harpies"
 Z3Z_removing_the_harpies_desc:0 "Those damn harpies, they came upon our transports, burned our scholars, executed our friends, and killed our horses. Now we are a split people looking for the bodies of our comerades so that we may once again be reunited. First though there is only one thing that we should do and that is to get revenge."
 Z3Z_searching_for_the_dragons_title:0 "Searching for the Dragons"
 Z3Z_searching_for_the_dragons_desc:0 "We know of a great battle between the dragons that once took place in these lands between a damestear dragon and a magically enhanced one. We shall grab pieces of both and combine them into a god for our people. But first we need to figure out where their resting place is."
 Z3Z_finding_the_site_title:0 "Finding the Site"
 Z3Z_finding_the_site_desc:0 "Finally after betrayals, seperation, war, and integration we have finally found where the resting place of the dragons are. Now that we have the location we dont really have the means to use it. We are too isolated and vulnerable. We have expanded a little past our means as a minority owning so much land. It is time to integrate the people further into our lands and ensure the promises that we have made to them is actually fulfilled so that we can work together to resurrect the dragons."
 Z3Z_accepting_the_people_title:0 "Accepting the People"
 Z3Z_accepting_the_people_desc:0 "The first step is to, of course, ensure that all the peoples under our control are accepted through and through. All Mengi cultures shall thrive so that our coffers remain full."
 Z3Z_removing_the_invaders_title:0 "Removing the Invaders"
 Z3Z_removing_the_invaders_desc:0 "The second promise was to ensure that all invaders are pushed back off of the shores of the mengi people. They, like us, had been a minority government but unlike us they exploit their lands while we offer generous promises and follow through on them. With the removal of these invaders we shall prove this once more."
 Z3Z_digging_into_the_dragons_graveyard_title:0 "Digging into the Dragons Graveyard"
 Z3Z_digging_into_the_dragons_graveyard_desc:0 "The dragons graveyard is where the final battle between the two dragons took place. It is a holy site for the people here as the hags most likely had a part to play in eztarthul's spawning and the Mengi's king Zenidir Zentirizar. Digging them would have been difficult before but after our integration as well as the idea of their old king returning has made many of the mengi people willing to cooperate and work with us. Now all that we have to do is pull it off."
 Z3Z_an_attempted_resurrection_title:0 "An Attempted Resurrection"
 Z3Z_an_attempted_resurrection_desc:0 "It is time. We have developed the lands, brought in new workforces, hired mages, and prepared armies to keep the lands safe. Now all that remains is to actually revive the dragons. While not all the pieces are here we should have enough to pull it off. There are questions to if we have the capability to revive such a massive beast with just our usual magics but there is only one way to find out."
 Z3Z_a_new_plan_title:0 "A New Plan"
 Z3Z_a_new_plan_desc:0 "It was a complete disaster. After all these years when it finally came time to revive the dragons it failed completely. What was supposed to be a grand reveal of the strength of our nation as well as a unifying force in our nation has now been shown as utter failure. Now it is time for us to reform our plans. The swamps of Yezel Mora house a world tree that if we can control we can use it as a battery for the resurrection. We also need our mages to hold more control as our undead armies are starting to expand past what one lich can control. We will need a network of mage towers and mages to ensure that our control is absolute even if somehow Mizcah were to die."
 Z3Z_preparing_the_ritual_title:0 "Preparing the Ritual"
 Z3Z_preparing_the_ritual_desc:0 "It is finally time to start the second attempt to resurrect the dragons. Before we do this though we need to ensure our country is ready for such a difficult spell. The mages will have to be given more support to pull this off."
 Z3Z_full_control_over_the_swamp_title:0 "Full Control Over the Swamp"
 Z3Z_full_control_over_the_swamp_desc:0 "Now that the mages are empowered we will now ensure that the location of our ritual, Yezel Mora, is binded to our will with full control to every nook and cranny in the forest. Nothing will come in or out without our knowledge."
 Z3Z_the_dragon_reborn_title:0 "The Dragon Reborn"
 Z3Z_the_dragon_reborn_desc:0 "Finally we have the means and abilities to revive the dragons. As far we can can be sure there is nothing that can go wrong this time. We have a world tree to focus our abilities, we have mages well versed in necromancy, we have full control of the swamp so no one may stop us. All that is left is to revive our god."
 Z3Z_minimal_parts_collected_title:0 "Minimal Parts Collected"
 Z3Z_minimal_parts_collected_desc:0 "While the dragons revival may have been not as expected due to our lack of a full dragon we are finally going to remove the largest contenders for his decay and that is the hags. What we thought was an engenous fix as the hags were magical creatures we thought it would help in forming the dragon. It was instead a blight upon the dragon that was too deep entwined for us to actually remove. But now that we have the parts we will replace the hags parts with them."
 Z3Z_medium_parts_collected_title:0 "Medium Parts Collected"
 Z3Z_medium_parts_collected_desc:0 "Now that we have scoured the lands it is time to remove the next blight upon our god and that is the trolls. While high in mass and an easy replacement when the dragon is hurt its clear that it is the weak point that enemy armies tend to focus on. While removing it will make our god more expensive to maintain it will make him extremely less vulnerable to all enemies."
 Z3Z_a_dragon_fully_built_title:0 "A Dragon Fully Built"
 Z3Z_a_dragon_fully_built_desc:0 "While the troll parts are no longer a part of our god it doesnt mean that they are complete either, just that there is enough dragon to not need these extra parts. Now though our god will be nearly complete. All major pieces returned and all that remains is a couple of parts owned by far away kingdoms that we can get to later. For the time being though we can say that our god is mostly complete"
 Z3Z_a_dragon_perfected_title:0 "A Dragon Perfected"
 Z3Z_a_dragon_perfected_desc:0 "We have finally completed it. Our god is completely resurrected as we expected when we once started this expidition. Throughout our years here we have gathered the pieces one by one rebuilding our god one piece at a time. His parts spread across the land as trophies for the kingdoms to gather and it was up to us to reunite them. It is now complete and our hunt is over. Our god has now hit a state that none shall challenge anymore."
 Z3Z_learning_about_genies_title:0 "Learning About the Genies"
 Z3Z_learning_about_genies_desc:0 "The genies were once the main power of this land due to their unique magic called the wish and being completely unkillable, they could only be bound. That was a long time ago and many are now bound or within their realms, as such to find them we will have to learn about them and find their realms so that they can teach us how to use the latent magic in the bones of our god"
 Z3Z_finding_the_first_genie_title:0 "Finding the First Genie"
 Z3Z_finding_the_first_genie_desc:0 "Now that we have the knowledge about the genies and their realms it has been decided to visit each of them to not only unlock the bones of the dragon but to also learn how to converse with the genies without our wishes being turned against us. Since the Djinn are the most powerful but also the ones most knowledgeable at betraying us we will go after them last."
 Z3Z_efreet_found_title:0 "Efreet Found"
 Z3Z_efreet_found_desc:0 "The Efreet were a subclass of genies that were extremely militaristic usually fighting with the Shaytan. They will respect our military might and may help us if we can prove ourselves in exchange for a wish."
 Z3Z_djinn_found_title:0 "Djinn Found"
 Z3Z_djinn_found_desc:0 "Finally after years of chasing it is time to confront the largest obsticle. The Djinn has been prepared for and found so all that is left is to confront them and finally get our god capable of using all their abilities effectively."
 Z3Z_new_things_to_research_title:0 "New Things to Research"
 Z3Z_new_things_to_research_desc:0 "It had taken a lifetime of learning but after travelling from eastern haless to northern sarhal and finally working as a mercenary, lichdom was acheived. Necromancy had been mastered to the best of the abilities of just about any race but what about the other magics? Now there is infinite time why not spend it learning more about the magics of this world. Now that everything is in motion there wont be much time but without having to sleep it will be important to learn all the magics that this world has to offer."
 Z3Z_hints_of_dragons_along_the_coast_title:0 "Hints of Dragons Along the Cost"
 Z3Z_hints_of_dragons_along_the_coast_desc:0 "We have heard rumors that the graveyard is along the coast and we had just missed it in our initial voyage. While this is extremely unlikely we still must search these lands regardless."
 Z3Z_accepting_local_traditions_title:0 "Accepting Local Traditions"
 Z3Z_accepting_local_traditions_desc:0 "While it is important that we control this land it is equally important that the people here are working under us happily. We should ensure that the humans here are accepted fully within our administration"
 Z3Z_understanding_the_magics_of_the_swamp_title:0 "Understanding the Magics of the Swamp"
 Z3Z_understanding_the_magics_of_the_swamp_desc:0 "The swamps air feels familiar to Mizcah. Necromancy of a smaller scale is at work here through and through. The hags probably aren't the source of it but their minions. This is probably why this swamp hasnt been reduced to rubble despite its constant aggression, no one can even get in. While Mizcah is at the top of the world for abilities perhaps there is more to learn."
 Z3Z_the_first_hag_title:0 "The First Hag"
 Z3Z_the_first_hag_desc:0 "The first hag has been found. Initial scouting suggests that there are three hags in total so we should deal with this one quickly before she either goes into hiding or they find a way to defeat us after our initial victories."
 Z3Z_the_second_hag_title:0 "The Second Hag"
 Z3Z_the_second_hag_desc:0 "The death of the first hag caused chaos within this swamp and we are sure the death of the second one will be no different. Once the second hag is dead we will have almost complete control over the swamp. Theya are getting desperate and it is our time to crush them while they cling to life."
 Z3Z_the_third_hag_title:0 "The Third Hag"
 Z3Z_the_third_hag_desc:0 "The third and final hag. With her death the swamp will be little more than a sanctuary of trolls until we remove them from this land. Soon this swamp will be a massive kobold territory in a sea of everyone else. But first we need to ensure that the hags are no more."
 Z3Z_the_world_tree_resplendant_title:0 "The World Tree Resplendant"
 Z3Z_the_world_tree_resplendant_desc:0 "While the swamp was teeming with magical energy it was hard for Mizcah to control it in an important enough way to revive the dragon but with a focus like the tree it will become much easier. The old world tree was against us but this new purified tree seems to be much more willing to support us in our needs in thanks to our cleaning up of this ancient swamp."
 Z3Z_a_legion_without_end_title:0 "A Legion Without End"
 Z3Z_a_legion_without_end_desc:0 "While when it comes to numbers for liches our numbers are few there has never been a lich so capable of reusing the dead as Mizcah has. Focusing completely on replenishing the numbers rather than having infinite numbers allows our troops to also be recognised in towns and through that builds trust even if they are little more than constructs for our use."
 Z3Z_mengi_leadership_integrated_title:0 "Mengi Leadership Integrated"
 Z3Z_mengi_leadership_integrated_desc:0 "After years and years of integration the decision was finally made to allow the mengi into the military. While the splitting of roles has been successful and while there is no want for them to become the undead like the kobolds do they are willing to lead them into battle and fight for glory in place of our generals."
 Z3Z_shaytan_found_title:0 "Shaytan Found"
 Z3Z_shaytan_found_desc:0 "The Shaytan are the builders and artists of the genies. They are generally found near the mountains making great works of art and fighting eachother due to differences of opinions in artistic work rather than anything else. We should build a great city nearby to their realm and present that to them as a way to garner their interest so that we can get them to unlock their magics on our god."
 Z3Z_a_new_home_title:0 "A New Home"
 Z3Z_a_new_home_desc:0 "After years of travelling and learning necromancy to keep everyone together it is time for us to finally settle. There all the remaining kobolds will set up camp in this city and slowly integrate themselves into it. From here we will start our search for the graveyard and revive our god."
 Z3Z_spying_for_information_title:0 "Spying for Information"
 Z3Z_spying_for_information_desc:0 "It appears that we are not liked in this land. Probably made worse by the other haless nations influencing the people into hatred against haless itself. We will eventually have to tackle this issue but first we need to know where the graveyard is. We will spy on the other nations to try and figure out this information."
 Z3Z_hints_of_dragons_to_the_west_title:0 "Hints of Dragons to the West"
 Z3Z_hints_of_dragons_to_the_west_desc:0 "There is apparently a graveyard to the west that is where the dragons have been laying. There seems to be a lack of supporting information for this but we dont have much else for leads"
 Z3Z_integrating_the_nobles_title:0 "Integrating the Nobles"
 Z3Z_integrating_the_nobles_desc:0 "While having the people on our side is our main objective the people cant really do much without the nobles so if the people want to revolt it will be the nobles supporting it and if the people want to work with us it will be the nobles that allows that to happen. Because of this we will be needing to have the nobles working with us first before we really get the people on our side."
 Z3Z_exploring_the_swamp_title:0 "Exploring the Swamp"
 Z3Z_exploring_the_swamp_desc:0 "The swamp is a mystery to us. While haless had its own thing with the spirits and whatnot we were always distracted by the dragons. Now however, we see a combination that we cannot ignore. The spirits are real and effecting us and we will need to kill them in order for us to revive our god. Therefore we need to first learn how to penitrate this swamp so that we can even get started in killing a spirit."
 Z3Z_learning_about_the_swamp_title:0 "Learning About the Swamp"
 Z3Z_learning_about_the_swamp_desc:0 "The swamps trolls have been pushed back for the first time in who knows how long. While we havent gotten anywhere important we can take a look at what we do have and try to learn from it. For example this land seems to have an infinite amount of trolls much like we have an infinite amount of undead but their trolls can die and we only need to be rebuilt. The swamp makes it impossible to know where we are going and as such the conquest will most likely be slow but even if its slow we need to control this swamp and to control it we will have to extensively understand it."
 Z3Z_expanding_the_world_tree_title:0 "Expanding the World Tree"
 Z3Z_expanding_the_world_tree_desc:0 "The world tree that was once corrupted has been purified. Now we will need to set up a proper town around it in order to complete the ritual. The mages will also need to be extensively in control of this area and as such their towers shall dot the skyline to help in the resurrection."
 Z3Z_the_last_fight_of_the_trolls_title:0 "The Last Fight of the Trolls"
 Z3Z_the_last_fight_of_the_trolls_desc:0 "The trolls have been for the most part defeated. They yearn for freedom as Mizcah has declared their extermination for our god. We shall leave the swamp and allow them to think they can revolt and through that we shall completely remove them from this plane of existance."
 Z3Z_an_army_worthy_of_the_dragons_title:0 "An Army Worthy of the Dragons"
 Z3Z_an_army_worthy_of_the_dragons_desc:0 "Now that we have resurrected our god it is time we prove ourselves worthy of keeping them under our control. While perhaps we wont really be losing control it is important to keep appearances and we should focus on having an army to at the very least support our god."
 Z3Z_experimenting_on_the_army_title:0 "Experimenting on the Army"
 Z3Z_experimenting_on_the_army_desc:0 "Now that we have revived our god we can now focus on expanding our military properly. There are many questions about the undead and it is time that those questions had answers"
 Z3Z_undead_facilities_expanded_title:0 "Undead Facilities Expanded"
 Z3Z_undead_facilities_expanded_desc:0 "Now that we know that the undead can learn its important that we start to answer more questions and in order to do this we need more troops to give our mages to test. Soon our military will perhaps not only be the largest but also the most well trained."
 Z3Z_training_the_undead_title:0 "Training the Undead"
 Z3Z_training_the_undead_desc:0 "While it has been a while since we learned that they can be trained it is time to prove that we have been incorperating that properly by having a professional undead army ready at all times for whatever we may face."
 Z3Z_infusing_draconic_blood_into_soldiers_title:0 "Infusing Draconic Blood into Soldiers"
 Z3Z_infusing_draconic_blood_into_soldiers_desc:0 "While we have spread the capabilities of our god we have found that it can bleed. This pure draconic blood should be put to good use in times of peace enhancing our soliders. This will make them more responsive and more aggressive, capable of breaking enemy morale faster than ever before. Currently they are only a  well trained army but they are slow. With this they will be quick and be able to parry blows they should not be able to, counter attacks they should not be able to and finally attack faster than they should be able to."
 Z3Z_marid_found_title:0 "Marid Found"
 Z3Z_marid_found_desc:0 "The Marid are genies that are extremely isolationist and proud. While the genies were tearing themselves apart the Marid focused on expanding their wealth and influence through their servants. This makes them both the easiest and most difficult to work with as what they want is easy but convincing them to come out and get it will be difficult and not only that but getting them to help us afterwords will be even harder. We will need a treasury that will be worth both."
 Z3Z_fortifying_our_positions_title:0 "Fortifying Our Positions"
 Z3Z_fortifying_our_positions_desc:0 "It is clear that we are not welcome here but we have a job to do and we cannot leave until it is complete. So in the meantime we will set up fortifications along the mountains to prevent any attempted conquests of our captial leaving us to only have to focus on the west."
 Z3Z_conquering_for_information_title:0 "Conquering for Information"
 Z3Z_conquering_for_information_desc:0 "While some want to spy for information it is not the only way to get the answers that we seek. We will use our undying legions to spread across this continent and find that information through captured nobles or surrenduring armies."
 Z3Z_the_gnolls_own_the_graveyard_title:0 "The Gnolls Own the Graveyard"
 Z3Z_the_gnolls_own_the_graveyard_desc:0 "We have been told of a Gnollish threat in the west that is the current owner of the graveyard. While this is almost without a doubt just an attempt to waste our resources there is some merit in removing the gnolls from their position as the strongest threat around us."
 Z3Z_granting_trade_initiatives_title:0 "Granting Trade Initiatives"
 Z3Z_granting_trade_initiatives_desc:0 "While many may not like that we are here we can prove that we are better than the other halessi people by allowing the mengi to continue their control of their trade and not exploiting them for their resources. Hopefully these initiatives will help them come around to our rule"
 Z3Z_building_up_the_towers_title:0 "Building up the Towers"
 Z3Z_building_up_the_towers_desc:0 "While having a necromancer in control is good and all controlling all these undead is without a doubt extremely difficult. As such we will be focusing our efforts on expanding the amount of control that the mages have in order to make them generals and lead our undead troops without the oversight of mizcah."
 Z3Z_mages_lands_expanded_title:0 "Mages Lands Expanded"
 Z3Z_mages_lands_expanded_desc:0 "We will start expanding the mages territory allowing them to not only have more resources to practice their craft but to create armies of their own. This will allow them to send even more troops than usual to help."
 Z3Z_relinquishing_control_to_mages_title:0 "Relinquishing Control to Mages"
 Z3Z_relinquishing_control_to_mages_desc:0 "Now that the mages have been given more lands and autonomy they have been able to supply our armies with more bodies than we are use to. With this we will be expanding the program and also enlisting the help of their most talented mages to help govern. While many may see this as mages taking control of more and more of the government they are nowhere near the power of Mizcah and as such they could never do more than allow corruption to spread within the country but that comes with its own risks of death."
 Z3Z_the_dragon_army_title:0 "The Dragon army"
 Z3Z_the_dragon_army_desc:0 "The spread of mages has allowed them to start making their own private armies as well as their yearly tribute of bodies for the country. These armies have been called Dragon Armies due to how they are dressed and the weapons given to them hearkening back to our draconic origins."
 Z3Z_defences_to_protect_the_swamp_title:0 "Defences to Protect the Swamp"
 Z3Z_defences_to_protect_the_swamp_desc:0 "Now that we control the swamp its now up to us to also hold the swamp. This is a detestable land to most as well as having little in the way of rare resources but it is still an important location to hold not just for the magics of controlling the dragon but also to control the mountains between the north and south. Building up our defences here will ensure that we can hold such a massive landmass."
 Z3Z_a_nation_worthy_of_the_dragons_title:0 "A Nation Worthy of the Dragons"
 Z3Z_a_nation_worthy_of_the_dragons_desc:0 "While it is suprising that we could even revive the dragon in the first place actually keeping it afloat has been much more expensive than origianlly thought. While Mizcah can do it on his own he cant be near the dragon 24/7 and as such an entire cabal of necromancers is often needed to follow them around. The costs to keep this going has been consistently high and some necromancers are even found dead leaving us having to hire even more of them. As such we need to focus our nation on expanding our income to keep these prices manageable for the country."
 Z3Z_mengi_properly_integrated_title:0 "Mengi Properly Integrated"
 Z3Z_mengi_properly_integrated_desc:0 "After years and years of working together we have built up enough Mengi communities that they have gone from kind of the a backwater that was slowly being consumed by civil strife and outside influence and is now more powerful than ever. Through this they are now much more willing to complete any task required of them and are fiercely loyal to Mizcah"
 Z3Z_proper_control_over_all_trade_routes_title:0 "Proper Control Over All Trade Routes"
 Z3Z_proper_control_over_all_trade_routes_desc:0 "What was once the main point of contention between haless and the mengi has now been properly set back into place under mengi control. Their craftsmenship now flows across Halann and the profits are properly in the hands of the Mengi instead of some outside power."
 Z3Z_a_nation_to_be_feared_title:0 "A Nation to be Feared"
 Z3Z_a_nation_to_be_feared_desc:0 "Over the years we have built up more and more and have been a fairly powerful regional power. It is time that we spread our wings and prove to the world that we are a mighty nation capable of standing toe to toe with any of the other great powers of the world."
 Z3Z_mages_control_increased_title:0 "Mages Control Increased"
 Z3Z_mages_control_increased_desc:0 "While mage control has steadily increased over the years they have always acted within their duties. It is time that we expand their capabilities at the cost of promoting those that go above and beyond for the country. This will allow them to have more control over the country but make them busy fighting eachtoher for compitition rather than working together. As long as they never unify under a single leader their compition for state sponsorship will allow us to go well above and beyond what we were capable of before"
 Z3Z_silat_found_title:0 "Silat Found"
 Z3Z_silat_found_desc:0 "The Silat are the genies that are probably the easiest for us to convince to help us as they tended to help mostly anyone out of curiosity in the past. We have found a certain issue though and that is that the swamp no longer houses their realm. They were kicked out by the Hags and it will take a great deal of work to once again establish a connection between us and them here."
 Z3Z_building_an_army_title:0 "Building an Army"
 Z3Z_building_an_army_desc:0 "It is time that we gather all the troops that we can muster and declare war against the Mengi people. While they may be united against us through proper maneuvering and wearing them down we may be able to spread large enough to properly defend ourselves."
 Z3Z_the_trolls_own_the_graveyard_title:0 "The Trolls Own the Graveyard"
 Z3Z_the_trolls_own_the_graveyard_desc:0 "We have been told that the Trolls own the graveyard. This is of course an attempt to get us to kill ourselves but there is merit to capturing the lands beside them to fortify and ensure that they never attempt to conquer us. It will probably be hard to hold the first wave of them as we learn their tactics but these fortresses will prove vital to ensuring that they dont wipe us off the map."
 Z3Z_further_mage_support_title:0 "Further Mage Support"
 Z3Z_further_mage_support_desc:0 "While the mages have always been helpful to us we have kind of mostly been using them while we situate ourselves. Now that we have situated ourself properly it is time that we thank this help and allow all to know that if you help Mizcah then the state will also help you."
 Z3Z_the_first_mengi_corps_title:0 "The First Mengi Corps"
 Z3Z_the_first_mengi_corps_desc:0 "While the Mengi were mostly used as craftsmen being able to focus on expanding our economy instead of warring and reducing their number there are always some that wish the fight alongside the troops in the front lines. These people have grown up with undead guards and trust them and this is their way of returning the favour. While they may not want to become undead when they die they will gladly fight beside them in order to keep their lands safe from invaders."
 Z3Z_an_army_to_protect_the_swamp_title:0 "An Army to Protect the Swamp"
 Z3Z_an_army_to_protect_the_swamp_desc:0 "Now that we hold the swamp it is important that we can fully control it. While more and more kobolds go to join their brethren in their new cities inside the swamp these people must feel safe and to do that we will expand the armies to the largest size that we can muster as well as bring Mizcah to the front lines as a show of force that we are prepared and ready for what may come ahead."
 Z3Z_production_of_mengi_goods_expanded_title:0 "Production of Mengi Goods Expanded"
 Z3Z_production_of_mengi_goods_expanded_desc:0 "now that the Mengi people are fully under our control we must show them the full fruits of working under our rule. By expanding their capabilities we will bring untold riches to even the smallest of Mengi villages and when their people are rich then so are we."
 Z3Z_a_treasury_for_the_dragon_title:0 "A Treasury for the Dragon"
 Z3Z_a_treasury_for_the_dragon_desc:0 "As a show of appreciation for all that we have been able to accomplish due to our god coming down and helping us we have decided to create an armor set for our god. While dragon armor may sound redundant, especially to one thats constantly revived and is undead, it will both be a show of force, not through might but economically, that we are rich enough to comission such a massive waste of capital."
 Z3Z_orisha_found_title:0 "Orisha Found"
 Z3Z_orisha_found_desc:0 "While we have some connection to the fey realm the Orisha have never been fond of the swamp and as such we had to search far and wide for a different forest that they would be attached to. This is when we were introduced to the fey realm near cannor. We will send a small deligation there to try and hire their help as well as offer gifts to them as a token of friendship. Hopefully when they return they will come with the knowledge of how to unlock their portion of the dragon."

 flavor_dual_dragon_domain.1.d:0 "Not long after hearing reports of a recent harpy attack near the shore as well as the remains of a ship crashing into the sand is there reports of a kobold mage and an undead army marching towards the city. This has made the people feel uneasy but the choice of the matter was decided to wait and see what happens. Deploying the army hastily could just add to the numbers and leaving things without any preparations could turn the whole city into undead. Instead the best course of action was decided to prepare defences and wait for their response.\n\nFinally the mage arrives at the gates and offers to leave their undead army outside and to come in unarmed. Hearing a mage say unarmed is of course a joke but killing them will just make the undead frenzy and thats a whole other issue. It was decided to let them in as they are much scarier with the army than without. When they approached They declared that their name was Mizcah Zyen and that they were on a mission to find the dragon graveyard and wished for help when the time came.

One that can infinitely reuse the same body but he has his morals and does not wish to create the undead out of those unwilling, or out of those that have not wronged him. The kobolds are willing to live a life free of work in exchange for eternal service while the humans tend to wish to work in exchange for not becoming undead. This system works but the question is how do we implement it? \n\nEither we can make quick tabs on the population and where there is a majority of kobolds then we will extract the bodies from there but expect no tribute of crafts and have the opposite being true where there is a majority of an accepted culture there will be no creating undead so no manpower gains but they will work tirelessly to craft what we need. \n\nThe other choice of course is to combine the two which is significantly more work but we can wait for the kobolds to die and reanimate them on the spot and those that we accept will work and not become undead. This will probably cause unrest though where both sides arent present and will require many kobolds to cross the lands to create useful cities"
