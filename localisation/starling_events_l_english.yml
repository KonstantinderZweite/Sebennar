 aethylwar.2.t: "The Aethylwex Civil War"
 aethylwar.2.d: "The Aethylwex Civil War- sometimes shortened to just 'Aethylwar'- has raged for nearly 3 decades. Once a prosperous and realtively safe realm the region now lies in utter ruin- and the land spells a ghastly tale of death and destruction. Peasants are starving, the cities no longer produce quality aristan goods, and fields lie fallow, with many of it's workers either in the army, or rotting in those same fields, dead from a raid. The war has gone on too long, with both sides reaching a breaking point. If neither capitulates soon, the entire region risks being conquered and partioned by the Monsters to the North, the Wildmen to the Southwest, or the Tricky Fey Elves to the West. The Aethylwar must end. Aethylwex must be reunited."
 aethylwar.2.a: "A grim reality- yet should we fail, the future is grimmer still."

 aethylwar.36.t: "The End of the Aethylwar"
 aethylwar.36.d: "After decades of war, it is finally over. Aethylwex is unified, and we are it's ruler. The path towards recovery will be a long and difficult one- but one which will give our people and nation the much-needed rest it has earned."

 aethylwar.20.t: "Defeat"
 aethylwar.20.d: "Our armies are broken, our nobles rebelious, and our legitimacy shattered. We have been defeated at every turn. Our advisors have come up with a drastic plan: take our court, march across now-hostile land, and escape to the forests of the Wildlands. We know nothing of these lands, only the horror stories our mothers would tell us when we were young- but we have no other choice. If we are to reclaim our destiny, we must recuperate."
 aethylwar.20.a: "The future is bleak, but we have no choice."
 flavor_EF9.1.t: "Into the Woods"
 flavor_EF9.1.d: "After the fall of our capital, we have retreated. Battered and broken we made our way across enemy territory, supported by loyal subjects and hiding from enemy patrols. From there, we enter the Wildlands- a place hostile to human life, and a land untamed by even the unified Aethylwex from which we descend. May Castellos guide us in what we must do next."
 flavor_EF9.1.a: "Through the Woods we go."
