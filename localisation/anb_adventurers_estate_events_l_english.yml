 adventurers_estate_events.1.d:0 "The status of the $ESTATE_ADVENTURERS$ does not rest on the privileges of the $ESTATE_NOBLES$ or the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ or the wealth of $ESTATE_BURGHERS$. Instead they have had to make their own fortunes by bravery and fighting skill. As a rule, however, this has gone very well for them lately. While not as prestigious business is in many ways the backbone of our economy and through their control over the means of production the $ESTATE_ADVENTURERS$ have managed to increase their power over our country."
