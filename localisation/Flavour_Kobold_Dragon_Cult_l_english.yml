 red_dragon_1_base:0 "Red Dragon: The Dragonhoard"
 desc_red_dragon_1_base:0 "Every kobold knows the tale of the mighty Red Dragon, whose avarice and greed created the biggest dragonhoard ever known. His spirit watches over us all, and his avarice is reflected in us. Contributing to our own hoards is for the followers of the Red Dragon more than duty – it is our mission to see them grow until our gods wake once more."
 red_dragon_2_base:0 "Red Dragon: Dragon's Peace"
 desc_red_dragon_2_base:0 "The rule of Nimrith the Red in Khugdihr lasted uncontested for over 600 years, and under him a secret society known as the Cult of Nimrithan rose in the shadows. The cult had followers of all religions and races, unified in peace and servitude to growing Nimrith hoard so his endless lust for gold could be sated. The lesson is thus – under a mighty ruler, one can hoard in peace."
 red_dragon_3_base:0 "Red Dragon: Nimrith's Law"
 desc_red_dragon_3_base:0 "Under Nimrith's rule, the Nimrithan were expected to contribute all their worldly possessions to the hoard. In overshadowing the temptation of their lesser greed with his grand avarice, Nimrith made the Nimrithan develop a strong sense of community – there was no room for misuse of wealth. This teaching has been codified as Nimrith's Law, and the followers of the Red Dragon now talk about wealth redistribution and the common good."
 
 blue_dragon_1_base:0 "Blue Dragon: Progenitor"
 desc_blue_dragon_1_base:0 "Long ago the great Blue Dragon showed us our way out of the Dragondepths and allowed us to live a life unlike any we had before. His strong leadership allowed us to make a home for ourselves in the Dragon coast and is the example taken by all that seek to serve the clan as a whole."
 blue_dragon_2_base:0 "Blue Dragon: Tayekan's Lessons"
 desc_blue_dragon_2_base:0 "As our understanding of Tayekan the Blue deepens, we find that there might have been lessons we have missed until now. Tayekan did not always choose violence, but also knew when to appease others. Tayekan's Lessons are now followed by the followers of the Blue Dragon, demanding them to consider their options before resorting to crude force."
 blue_dragon_3_base:0 "Blue Dragon: The Observer"
 desc_blue_dragon_3_base:0 "Tayekan the Blue is a secretive god, who likes to lurk behind the scenes rather than act openly. We have heard rumours and anecdotal evidence suggesting that he may still be among us, hiding in plain sight. This realisation has revolutionised the cult of the Blue Dragon with a shift towards the secretive and clandestine. "
 
 green_dragon_1_base:0 "Green Dragon: Sea Guardian"
 desc_green_dragon_1_base:0 "Old greenscale legends tell about the mighty Green Dragon of the waves, who protects her children from the cruel seas and guides them on their journeys. Her protection is thus often sought by sailors and kobolds of the sea."
 green_dragon_2_base:0 "Green Dragon: The Matron"
 desc_green_dragon_2_base:0 "Not much is known about the Iothoral, yet it is certain that her cult views her as a draconic matron; an absent mother compared to Tayekan's fathership. Kobold sailors search and claim distant lands in search of her, many without any intention of returning. Rumours tell of a mighty green dragon in the far west…"
 green_dragon_3_base:0 "Green Dragon: Iothoral The Lost"
 desc_green_dragon_3_base:0 "After searching Iothoral was found, but not in the place ancient legend would have you believe. We have heard tales of Iothoral the Green's slumber in the mighty Deepwoods, far from our craggy coasts. This has caused a theological uproar in the cult of the Green Dragon, with connections drawn between older myths and traditions and newer evidence – for example, ships of mighty, holy, wood."
 
 black_dragon_1_base:0 "Black Dragon: Overwhelming Force"
 desc_black_dragon_1_base:0 "The mighty Black Dragon is only followed by the harshest and cruellest of kobolds, admiring domination and subjugation of the weak. Although not a stance shared by many, it is nonetheless respected as a return to tradition – our origins lay here."
 black_dragon_2_base:0 "Black Dragon: Primacy of Might"
 desc_black_dragon_2_base:0 "One thing holds true in any age: might is the only thing that matters. What use are petty justifications when there is no might to back them up? The cult of the Black Dragon has reformed from a fringe cult to an institution of its own – an institution dedicated to emulating Zaamalot the Black and ensuring our rule via force."
 black_dragon_3_base:0 "Black Dragon: Zaamalot's Reign"
 desc_black_dragon_3_base:0 "Zaamalot the Black is a feared name throughout the world, a clear symbol of the superiority of dragons. Our historical findings from Zaamalot's reign have inspired the cult of the Black Dragon – they now proclaim that kobolds have the divine right to rule the entire world, as children of the dragons."
 
 white_dragon_1_base:0 "White Dragon: Cold Death"
 desc_white_dragon_1_base:0 "The clever White Dragon hunts not her prey directly, but lets it tire itself out in a bitter cold until it is time to strike. A popular deity with hunters and fishers, her guidance may come to serve the patient kobold well."
 white_dragon_2_base:0 "White Dragon: Permafrost"
 desc_white_dragon_2_base:0 "The cult of the White Dragon has organised and spread their teachings to many soldiers, installing into them a patience reminiscent of Elkaesal the White's own. While no major demographic change has followed, many of their teachings mesh well with our natural tendency to prefer holding our enemies fast and striking suddenly when conditions are favourable."
 white_dragon_3_base:0 "White Dragon: Elkaesal the Inevitable"
 desc_white_dragon_3_base:0 "In the frozen lands to the north a prophecy is sung by the skald-priests, foretelling certain doom should Elkaesal the White wake. As long as their flame burns, the world is safe from her frost. Of course, we know that this is just another reflection of her infinite patience – she is inevitable. This teaching has resonated deeply within the cult of the White Dragon."
 
 purple_dragon_1_base:0 "Purple Dragon: Subterranean Guardian"
 desc_purple_dragon_1_base:0 "Despite our ventures on the surface, our origins lay underground. The guardian deity favoured by many subterranean dwellers is the Purple Dragon, who inspires us to work harder for a good life. Her followers lead example by never slacking when there is work to be done."
 purple_dragon_2_base:0 "Purple Dragon: Improvise, Adapt, Overcome"
 desc_purple_dragon_2_base:0 "Life underground has always been harsh, with many dangers. However, we have always thrived, in part due to our natural ingenuity. The cult following the Hunter of the Deep has recently been stressing this – ingenuity is industriousness, and thus a virtue."
 purple_dragon_3_base:0 "Purple Dragon: Hunter of the Deep"
 desc_purple_dragon_3_base:0 "The Purple Dragon is proving elusive, with little history to find. Unfortunately, what we have found is painting a somewhat different picture of her than the myths we know. This has led to a shift in the cult of the Purple Dragon, the Hunter of the Deep, with her as less of a matronly leader and more of a harsh taskmistress. This religiously motivated discipline is very effective, however."
 
 brown_dragon_1_base:0 "Brown Dragon: Unbridled Fury"
 desc_brown_dragon_1_base:0 "The cult of the Brown Dragon is one of the smaller cults, with a disorganised following. This does not mean that a follower of the Brown Dragon is to be trifled with – indeed, quite the opposite, as few things can stand between the primal fury of someone who follows the tenets of wilderness."
 brown_dragon_2_base:0 "Brown Dragon: Small but Mighty"
 desc_brown_dragon_2_base:0 "While there still is no grand following of the Sand Demon of the Salahad, philosophers and other thinkers have started to apply some of their philosophy to other problems in our society. A few prominent examples are an increase in debate culture, striking, and a general assertiveness. The other races best make way!"
 brown_dragon_3_base:0 "Brown Dragon: Force of Nature"
 desc_brown_dragon_3_base:0 "The followers of the Sand Demon Cult have gained much notoriety among the worshippers of the dragon cult. They are infamous for being forces of nature. Almost nothing is known about the Sand Demon, besides that he once (almost) killed Aakhet, and that he is a dragon without flight. He breaks through cities, he tunnels under the sand... he is nothing but a monster, and a glorious one at that. To the Brown Dragon goes the spoils!"
 
 brass_dragon_1_base:0 "Brass Dragon: Protector of the Weak"
 desc_brass_dragon_1_base:0 "The cult of the Brass Dragon holds morals dear, and has a large following among the bravest warriors. One important point in his cult is to support those weaker than you, lest they be harmed. A leader following the Brass Dragon would enjoy a becalmed populace, as they know they are protected."
 brass_dragon_2_base:0 "Brass Dragon: Jyntas the Liberator"
 desc_brass_dragon_2_base:0 "With the growing influence of the cult of the Brass Dragon, certain stories have recently had an upswing in our society. One story tells of how Jyntas the Brass for no gain of his own saved a people because he saw it was right. This has no doubt inspired all our warriors; to know that there can be a greater cause."
 brass_dragon_3_base:0 "Brass Dragon: Champion of Justice"
 desc_brass_dragon_3_base:0 "Our search for evidence has recently borne fruit, and the cult of the Brass Dragon seems to be truthful. Jyntas was a wandering warrior, travelling the world and combating injustice where he saw it. One accredited source from the east tells of a mysterious martial hero named Jyntas, saving a people from slavery under malevolent lords. This has made our populace proud, and optimism is prevailing."
 
 copper_dragon_1_base:0 "Copper Dragon: The Free Spirit"
 desc_copper_dragon_1_base:0 "The followers of the Copper Dragon are a flighty sort, tending to move around our realm at will. Their loose cult teaches independence, but also to travel with purpose; often this purpose is to get perspective on the world. Among the warriors, the Copper Dragon is not a favourite, but perhaps there are more things in life than war?"
 copper_dragon_2_base:0 "Copper Dragon: Alos' Peace"
 desc_copper_dragon_2_base:0 "The cult of the Copper Dragon has organised, resulting in learned scholars and merchants freely wandering about and offering Alos' Peace. There are some that have made ventures into other realms, to some success. The evidence pointing towards Alos the Copper being a relatively peaceful and sociable dragon has only exacerbated this."
 copper_dragon_3_base:0 "Copper Dragon: The Prankster God"
 desc_copper_dragon_3_base:0 "In direct refutation of prevailing theories, our scholars maintain that Alos the Copper is alive and about, living a peaceful, albeit mischievous, life. Armed with their religious texts, and a good dose of optimism, the followers of Alos have gone out into the world and spread tales of a god, long thought dead, living among us, and some of their teachings have even found favour with non-Kobold populations."
 
 bronze_dragon_1_base:0 "Bronze Dragon: The Conqueror"
 desc_bronze_dragon_1_base:0 "The teachings of the Bronze Dragon puts a strong emphasis on warrior culture, and has become the major cult for our warriors with the decline of swarm tactics over the years. As one of the younger cults its tenets are often in flux, but with myths which primarily revolve around conquest and war there is a clear direction forward."
 bronze_dragon_2_base:0 "Bronze Dragon: Roar of War"
 desc_bronze_dragon_2_base:0 "After a gradual increase in influence, the cult of Aakhet has branched out into not only warfare but also war materiel. With inspiration from a dragon's mighty roar, one innovation of note is so-called roaring cannons, which both have an intimidation factor, religious significance, and better effect."
 bronze_dragon_3_base:0 "Bronze Dragon: Aakhet's Example"
 desc_bronze_dragon_3_base:0 "The great Aakhet the Bronze was a mighty conqueror, famed for conquering all of Kheterata and much of Bulwar. This discipline is something that has been preached by the cult of the Bronze Dragon, leading to clear chains of command and unbreaking lines of soldiers, especially those who follow Aakhet the Bronze."
 
 silver_dragon_1_base:0 "Silver Dragon: Overseer of Justice"
 desc_silver_dragon_1_base:0 "The cult of the Silver Dragon are represented greatly in the vicinity of the ruler, as their tenets include lawfulness and justice. This has led them to naturally seek administrative roles. The myth of the Silver Dragon tells of a just and proud guardian protecting the lawful – a good deity for a just ruler."
 silver_dragon_2_base:0 "Silver Dragon: King of Dragons"
 desc_silver_dragon_2_base:0 "The cult of the Silver Dragon has organised their tenets around the divine right of the ruler to rule, with the Silver Dragon as the King of Dragons. These new tenets were in part inspired by tales of an ancient human empire with the Silver Dragon as patron. Outside of our territory, the reception to the Silver Dragon is generally positive, and inside, our new institutions allow us to rule better than ever before."
 silver_dragon_3_base:0 "Silver Dragon: Avatar of Castellos"
 desc_silver_dragon_3_base:0 "A grand revelation has been made – the other races worship the Silver Dragon too! His name is Castellos the Silver, and he is the king of their gods. This has greatly swayed the public opinion of the other races; we will gladly extend the spirit of community to these dragon-worshippers!"
 
 gold_dragon_1_base:0 "Gold Dragon: Golden Prosperity"
 desc_gold_dragon_1_base:0 "The myths of the Gold Dragon tells of a wise and benevolent protector, letting his chosen lands prosper while letting his wise subjects rule in his stead. His followers tell us that this is the path to enlightenment, whatever that means."
 gold_dragon_2_base:0 "Gold Dragon: Balris' Teachings"
 desc_gold_dragon_2_base:0 "The strengthened cult of the Gold Dragon has started preaching a set of teachings called Balris' Teachings, first of which is something called the Golden rule. It states: "Live a virtuous life, and stay in balance with yourself and with others. In this, you may expect the same in return". This is taken to mean that if a ruler acts well, then subjects will follow their example."
 gold_dragon_3_base:0 "Gold Dragon: Wisdom in Humility"
 desc_gold_dragon_3_base:0 "A new interpretation of the wisdom of Balris is that there is wisdom in humility; to let your ego stand in the way of progress is a great sin. In particular, the ruler's advisors are adamant that there is something to gain here…"

When in one of his rare contemplative moods, Varlengeilt told dragon-priest and compiler Irto Trapsneak of the gladiatorial arena his father was forced into, of the few faithful that hid him from the hunters and brought him to the comfortably unfeeling embrace of the mountains.

Therefore, as the Dragon Cult developed, the goddess of purple become one of the masses. The kobold pray to the dragon of purple whenever they seek good health, hearth, or home.\n\nFrom Bulwar and the Middle Dwarovar, though, rumors swirl of a different kind of purple dragon: one of destruction and death. They speak there of the "Hunter of the Deep," a cruel and terrible being of the dark. They say she stalks at night, corrupting minds and lives, killing all who come close without remorse.\n\nAfter so long of searching for the dragons, this is the first time the kobolds of [Root.GetName] have found themselves truly baffled by the description of a dragon. This certainly cannot be the case, can it? This "Hunter" must not be as bad as people say!"

She had worshiped the Purple Dragon since childhood, almost seeing the Mother as a member of her own family. As each new tale of destruction reaches her, though, it almost seems like everything she knew about the Purple Dragon was wrong. Perhaps, she thinks, there are two purple dragons– the Mother, and the Hunter– but even this brings little comfort. As the kobolds reach across Halann, the only evidence of purple they find is in destruction.\n\nIn Seghdihr, they say, the Hunter once rampaged through and collapsed a full level of the hold.

Another discovered an artifact from the old days of Aul-Dwarov, contorted into a form where all it spewed was anti-life magic. A fourth fell sick to a disease which petrified their throats, rendering them unable to speak as dehydration took its toll. With each expedition, a new horror is discovered.\n\nAt the center of the hold is the Dragon's Wound, created by the Hunter of the Deep when she emerged during the Dragonwake. As she broke through the foundations of the ancient hold, she spewed an endless fog of purple miasma. It acted quickly, rendering everything mad: it contorted the mind, the body, and even inanimate stone, rendering every artifact held in the vaults into a destructive facsimile of what they once were. This miasma continues to contort and change everything in the depths of the hold, and some even say it has created new species of its own. The Deep Hunters, at bare minimum, seem to have emerged from the Wound.\n\nDragon-priest Daltux manages these constant expeditions, growing to understand the horrors of the Hunter with each passing day. After years of her work, two things are clear. The first is that the Wound is horrifying, a place from which death emerges. The second is that the Wound is beautiful, creating life and properties never before seen on Halann.\n\nHere, at the heart of the Hunter's work, a primordial chaos reigns.

Both are brought by people– in their thousands, in their millions– and each arrives with stories of who they are, and what they know.\n\nBy one of the Gulf's countless rivers, in one of its countless ports, a kobold listens to Rahen's countless stories. She listens especially for rumors of Jyntas, the brass dragon who seems to be everywhere all at once. At one point, she hears that Jyntas was responsible for the fall of Harimar's empire; in another, response for the death of Jaher. They say that she helped Suhan spread his Praxis, and also helped stop him from succeeding too fully. They say she fought Aakhet and won, they say she killed all the dragons who opposed her, and they say that she broke chains wherever she went. It is impossible to tell which stories are true, and which stories are false; but this, to the dragon-priest, is normal. It is always easier to determine what a dragon might have done than what they actually achieved.\n\nAbove all else, the stories which catch the dragon-priest's ear are about Bhuvari. Corroborated by hundreds of travelers is one grand story: that Jyntas revealed herself, in full draconic might, to free the slaves of Bhuvari. She sent the armies of the Harimari running for the jungles, and attempted to create a free state in the ashes of her dragonfire.\n\nThe problem, it seems, is that Bhuvari is still in chains. Slaves run its markets, where far more slaves are sold. Perhaps, by freeing those who are sold there, [Root.GetName] could catch Jyntas's eye..."

It's a rare sight for a drake to be allowed to destroy buildings as they please, but here, after all inhabitants have been evacuated, the holy steeds have been released with vigor. "This practice is disgusting and immoral, surely– and I am glad we are abolishing it– but there is a motive. One greater than freedom."\n\n"And what motive is that?" inquires the guardswoman, hired as a retainer and translator. She watches the drakes chew at stone and wood, and lightly pushes her employer out of the way when a brick flies in his direction.\n\n"To find Jyntas," Derrikak continues. "She was the liberator of this entire estuary. She cares for freedom: for the destruction of chains. Bhuvari kept manacles in rejection of her ideals, and so we now destroy their chains. We think, if we pursue this path to its conclusion, she might deem us worthy of an audience."\n\n"That's quite a straightforward plan, don't you think?" responds the guard. She stands easily twice as tall as the kobold, and her metal armor shines in the light like brassy scales. "There's no subtlety to it. You think she'll come meet with you if you simply free enough slaves? Do you imagine her keeping a counter of how many people you have liberated, waiting until you hit the right number?"\n\n"Perhaps!" the kobold responds. "Perhaps. Dragons are enigmatic beings. Who am I to assume how she thinks?"\n\n"A priest," says the guard, "whose purpose is to understand her. Perhaps, if you are to tread this path, you could at least imagine something greater. Destroy the Command and break it into pieces, or liberate the slaves of the Gulf. Wouldn't those be accomplishments be worthy of a dragon's attention?"\n\nDerrikak thinks for a while, before nodding. "Yes," he eventually says, "that's quite a good point. Perhaps I'll report back to the capital soon, and suggest that we..."

"Yes, you've done a rather fine job. If only the dragons were so easily manipulated."\n\nDerrikak waves her off, staring ahead past the vast Gulf of Rahen. "She is here, I know it. And we have made our intentions clear. We've destroyed slavery in the Gulf, and liberated everyone they ruled over... and truly, we could do so much else for her. She would only need to make herself known for us to be at her beck and call. We control the seas, the land, the skies; we can destroy even the Command, and all who oppose the Brass Dragon. Why wouldn't she want to reveal herself; why wouldn't she want to use us? We offer ourselves as a tool, and we only need a wielder."\n\n"Perhaps she can control you already," says the guardswoman.

The guard continues: "If you are already doing what she wants, why reveal herself at all?"\n\nDerrikak, frustrated, turns around. "Because we need her," he demands, before he realizes what is in front of him. "Because," he continues, looking up, "we need... oh."\n\nJyntas smiles, and pats him on the head.

Not a day goes by without a fatality, and some days entire teams are wiped out when a foundation collapses or an avalanche pushes us back.\n\nProgress is made, however, and on the 1155th day of the expedition, the first roar is heard. Whatever is up there, it sounds big enough to be Balris.\n\nDays go by, and the path forged ahead gets steeper and more dangerous with every step taken. Railings made of rope, fastened with artificer steel-pins, keep most exhausted diggers from falling off, but not all. Morale was getting low, but on the 1163rd day, Balris blessed the expedition with his visage. He flew over and gazed upon his admirers, unmistakably gargantuan and unquestionably gold. He was Balris the Gold.\n\nAll along the expedition, like a long line of dominoes, the Goldscales fall to their feet; they all pray, gawking at He Who Will Return. Most Kobildzani do the same, for even a people who already have dragons are still dazzled by the might of the ancients. Only the dragons stay standing, and Balris seems to look on with interest. As he scans over the human form of Jyntas and the elven Varlengeilt, he makes no reaction: but his eyes grow bright at the sight of giant kobolds with wings and scales. He follows the expedition trail all the way to the foot of the Jade Mountains, eventually turning around to do a double take, before ascending back upon Balris' Rest, his millennium throne."

 flavour_balrijin.77.desc2: "As the spearhead of the expedition climbs ever higher, the terrain becomes more noticeably hostile. It has been getting harder and harder for the logistic teams to ferry supplies up the increasingly steep terrain carved by wind and weather, but now a hardness of breathing and the omnipresence of ice and snow further exacerbates the struggle. As much as the logistics teams struggled, doubly so did the spearhead, for they had to alter the terrain and breathe the thinnest air of them all. To this end, artificers have become increasingly vital for the expedition spearhead, with air being siphoned in whilst ice is molten with flaming gadgetry, and snow displaced through thunderous claps of magic. This violence of elements and sound has proven as hostile to the mountain as the mountain has been to us, for every so often an avalanche would cascade its way down, through the mist, into the nothingness.\n\nAs they watch the snow fall, Jyntas asks a simple question. "He saw them as dragons, but not us, didn't he?"\n\nVarlengeilt nods. He doesn't say anything in return."

 flavour_balrijin.46.desc2: "As the diggers' foreman declared their work almost complete, hundreds of dignitaries were already bunched up behind him, eagerly inching forward.\n\nWith the final strike, the tunnel's exit was sent crumbling to the ground, revealing the ancient, steep-sloped caldera-turned-lair, within which Balris lay. The clergy were the first to storm in, starting a chant that quickly drowned out the dragon's snoring, entreating him to make his triumphant return to Balriza. Next came the nobility of the various clans, showering Balris' Rest in a carpet of gifts, while Goldscales paired off to perform silent Dragon Dances and Kobildzani electrified the area with hundreds of powerful gadgets. Balris rose slowly, opening sleepy eyes to gaze (with no small amount of surprise) upon his ardent admirers and worshippers. One by one, representatives of the various clans, factions, and nations filed into the depression, hoping to speak to Balris, bearing yet more gifts. Despite everything, Balris remained quiet.\n\nHours went by and the piles of gifts grew larger, some almost beginning to match their enormous recipient in height. Still, though, the great Dragon-Sage remained in resigned, somewhat confused silence. It wasn't until Jyntas and Varlengeilt both stood in draconic form among a hundred fully-Ascended kobolds, blocking the great tunnel and forcing all others out, that Balris slowly began to cry.\n\n"You did it," he says, with the tears in his giant eyes making each look like a reflection of the moon upon the ocean. He stares at each kobold– each dragon– with equal wonder. "The dragons are recovered. We have children again. We will live on.""
 flavour_balrijin.46.b: "Yes, Balris, we will."

 flavour_balrijin.86.desc2: ""I could not find you," Balris says, as he slowly begins to rise. His head hits the ceiling, and it nearly causes a cave-in, but the artificers of Kobildzan had already reinforced the walls. "I tried so hard, but so many rebuked me, and I could not... oh, Jyntas, how good it is to see you. Are these– are these all your children? They cannot be." Then, seeing the Goldscales in their ranks, he sighs in relief. "Oh, and my own kin among them..."\n\nAs Balris trails off, Jyntas snarls in negation. "They are not my children, Balris. They are..." she looks to Varlengeilt, who (at this point) has already halfway turned back into a Rzentur as to make more space in the overstuffed cavern. "They are yours, Varlengeilt? They are... Tayekan's?"\n\n"No," replies Varlengeilt. "The Kobildzani are kin to me, but they are not my children. My children are in Rzenta. And Tayekan... no. They are their own keepers."\n\nBalris, unable to understand, continues to look at all the dragons he had never known. He touches a claw to an ascended Goldscale– gently, delicately, as if they would shatter– before sobbing louder and more violently than before. "All the dragons I'd been looking for," he says. "Jyntas, we are not dead. The Elves did not kill us. I do not know 'Kobildzan,' or 'Rzenta,' but there must be... oh, there must be entire civilizations of dragons there. You found them. You found where they had been hiding."\n\nAmong the Ascended stands [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]. "Yes," [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] says, with scales shining and with wings as imposing as those of Balris. "We have made civilizations of dragons. And we would like to show them to you.""
