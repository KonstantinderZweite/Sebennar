 E19_establish_colonies_title:0 "Establish New Colonies"
 E19_establish_colonies_desc:0 "We are extremly fortunate. Though one could hardly call the Wildlands "safe", the immediate area around us seems to more-or-less fit the term. We should establish outposts to gather resources and grow our population."
 E19_into_woods_title:0 "Into the Woods"
 E19_into_woods_desc:0 "After the fall of our capital, we have retreated. Battered and broken we made our way across enemy territory, supported by loyal subjects and hiding from enemy patrols. From there, we enter the Wildlands- a place hostile to human life, and a land untamed by even the unified Aethylwex from which we descend. May Castellos guide us in what we must do next."
 E19_send_scouts_title:0 "Send Scouting Parties"
 E19_send_scouts_desc:0 "We know almost nothing about these lands- outside of the horror stories our mothers would tell us as children, and it would be suicide to make continue our journey as this ragtag convoy. We must send scouts so we can discover resources and find threats- before they find us."
 E19_scouts_return_title:0 "The Scouts Return"
 E19_scouts_return_desc:0 "Our scouts have returned. What knowledge have they gleaned?"
 E19_new_capital_title:0 "Our New Capital"
 E19_new_capital_desc:0 "Our scouts have found a suitable position for a city. Every day that passes our old enemy sits on their throne, consolidating power and legitimacy. We must settle our convoy and set to work growing our new headquarters. We have no time to lost."
 E19_expand_capital_title:0 "Expand the Capital"
 E19_expand_capital_desc:0 "As the new seat of our operations, we should set about improving our capital. Tents are hardly suitable for a future King, after all."
 E19_more_scouts_title:0 "More Expeditions"
 E19_more_scouts_desc:0 "Though our immediate clearing seems mostly safe, this is only one small part of the Wildlands. We should explore more areas, lest an unlucky excursion from the denizens that dwell here put an early end to our destiny."
 E19_explore_north_title:0 "Explore North"
 E19_explore_north_desc:0 "We should explore north, and find out what awaits us there."
 E19_monsters_title:0 "Monsters!"
 E19_monsters_desc:0 "The expedition heading the northern maps have returned with grave news. Our old enemies- a monstrous mix of Trolls and Kobolds have been spotted. We must prepare ourselves!"
 E19_berlin_moscow_axis_title:0 "Unholy Alliance"
 E19_berlin_moscow_axis_desc:0 "The first person to suggest an alliance with the monsters was hung within thirty minutes. The second was thrown into a pit of hungry dogs. The third; however, remains alive by the grace of Castellos. Our Lord has seen the pragmatism in reaching out to the monsters for help, however much we may detest it. We should send an envoy to trek over the treacherous terrain and attempt to communicate with these abberations- if indeed they are capable of communication."
 E19_explore_south_title:0 "Explore South"
 E19_explore_south_desc:0 "We should explore south, and find out what awaits us there."
