 flavor_rajnadhaga.1.d:0 "Sarilavhan was the capital of the Raghajandi kingdom, one of the main powers of Shamakhad for centuries, and a beacon of civilisation. The hobgoblin Command settled there, reducing its population to slavery while their leaders roamed the palaces and manors defacing them with their lack of taste. After our victory in the latest war the city was freed and our soldiers entered it as liberators, freeing the masses of Khedarid people from their shackles. But our soldiers were not enough to canalize the fury of the crowds that pillaged their own cities, tracking the goblins that had stayed there, burning much of the city in the meantime. Now Sarilavhan is pacified and returned to Humans, but at a dire cost."

The Statist school mainly found among our administrators emphasis the role of the state, the only guarantee of peace and security. The River school, called this because of the book 'The Worldy Rivers', emphasis the role of the openness and exchange.
