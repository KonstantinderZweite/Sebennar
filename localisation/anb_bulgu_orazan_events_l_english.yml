 bulgu_orazan.1.t:0 "Songs of Bramash"
 bulgu_orazan.1.d:0 "Bramash Clouded Eye rose to legendary status after he led the enslaved orcs of Ozgarom from Endralliande to the jungles of Soruin, on boats taken from their oppressors, to pursue a life of freedom. He is considered the founding father of Ozgarom and has even attained deification in some households, as Bramash the Liberator. His Songs instill bravery in many orcs in the new world, who still struggle against slavery, indentured servitude, racism and colonialism."

 bulgu_orazan.2.t:0 "Songs of Korgus"
 bulgu_orazan.2.d:0 "Korgus Dookanson united millions of orcs for a common goal but ultimately failed to do what he strove to achieve and died at the hands of a human woman. Most orcs derive from this story that one must never overestimate one's own strength, and always be cautious."

 bulgu_orazan.3.t:0 "Songs of Brasûr"
 bulgu_orazan.3.d:0 "Brasûr Frozenmaw was exiled with his clan and saw his father die in a duel to Korgus for disputing his status, but then united the Gray Orc clans and persevered through cold unknown lands, surviving their exile and establishing a kingdom. Most orcs derive from this story a resolve to keep fighting for what you believe, even if you get punished for it."

 bulgu_orazan.5.t:0 "Songs of Bluetusk"
 bulgu_orazan.5.d:0 "Lothane Bluetusk, who fought alongside Corin against the Dookanson, is a controversial figure in orcish society, considered by some to be a traitor to the race. However to many half-orcs he is seen as the first prominent defender of their cause. He may have failed to protect his half-orc group against Karagh Bloodfist, but he managed to save thousands of other orcs and half-orcs by promoting integration and tolerance of (half-)orcs in Corintar society."

 bulgu_orazan.9.d:0 "Bordu, who would later in life be known as Bordu Crownshatterer, was an orc who was part of the horde which took Amldihr from the dwarves. He is said to have taken the Dwarovkron from a dwarven king himself. Legend has it he used all his strength to bend the dwarven crown to fit on his own head, shattering bits off in the process. That day he became Bordu Crownshatterer, father of the Shattered Crown clan, chief of Amldihr. He spent most his life unifying the vast hold of Amldihr under his one clan and bringing structure to a otherwise chaotic society. The Songs of him speak of the many scars he got and friends he lost trying to unify his hold, something we could all learn from."

 bulgu_orazan.10.t:0 "Female Shamans?"
 bulgu_orazan.10.d:0 "Should women be allowed to be shamans? This question has been fanning the flames of debate in [Root.Capital.GetName]. Prominent shamans and people holding political power have been bickering over the implications of removing the few women who currently fulfill the role of shaman in their communities.\n\nProponents of officially allowing female shamans argue that banning women from perform the profession will prevent certain small communities from getting any spiritual guidance, as there are no men around learned enough in the Songs to replace them. Many men in positions of powers argue that male shamans are more capable as leaders of struggling communities.\n\nWhat does [Root.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] think?"

From an orcish perspective the historical answer is obviously no, but various religious and philosophical organisations have their clergymen practice abstinence and claim it leads to a more fruitful environment for them.\n\nThis conversation would not be important if it were not for the fact that the daughter of a prominent noble in [Root.Capital.GetName] got pregnant from the shaman who was supposed to be teaching her the Songs of her heritage. The noble was livid and has with the nation on alert, others have come forth with similar stories.\n\nWhat does [Root.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] think?"
