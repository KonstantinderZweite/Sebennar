 adventurer.5.d:0 "As an adventuring company we are expected to fight against the Greentide, and to aid in the reclamation with Escann. Due to [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s insistence that there was no cause for our wars our company has caused our company to begin to fall apart, as many question what our purpose even is. It will take many years for us to recover from this."

 adventuring.1.b:0 "Give a share to the crew that found it!"

 adventuring.4.d:0 "Rumour has it that a few of our prominent captains have been keeping more than their fair share of treasure, and worse, a representative of the angry parties has approached us with proof on the matter: what do we do?"
 adventuring.4.a:0 "Confiscate all their gold and redistribute it to the company!"
 adventuring.4.b:0 "Confiscate some of their gold!"
 adventuring.4.c:0 "So what?"
 adventuring.5.t:0 "Disloyal Adventurers"
 adventuring.5.d:0 "A group of our most skilled adventurers refuse to share their spoils or knowledge of their endeavours."
 adventuring.5.a:0 "Maybe some gold can regain their loyalty?"
 adventuring.5.b:0 "Reprimand them."
 adventuring.5.c:0 "Expel them from the company!"

 adventuring.8.d:0 "We may have wrested control of [rebuild_province.GetName] from their old owners, but a large contingent of our company have suggested we invest in building up the local infrastructure. Some, however, say this is a waste of time, and we should focus on simply using the province as a home base for nearby quests and adventure."
 adventuring.8.a:0 "Good idea, foundations are key!"
 adventuring.8.b:0 "Not just rebuild, but improve!"
 adventuring.8.c:0 "We're here to fight and go on adventures, not build!"

 adventuring.10.t:0 "Adventurers Leave Our Company"
 adventuring.10.d:0 "Adventurers are a fickle bunch, and at their core: a nomadic soul. A prominent group of adventurers have decided to go elsewhere in search for new quests and tales of bravery and wonder."
