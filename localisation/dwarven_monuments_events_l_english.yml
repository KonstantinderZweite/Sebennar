dwarven_monuments_vaulthold.1.t: "Technology of the Precursors"
dwarven_monuments_vaulthold.1.d: "Inside the Vaulthold we uncovered something incredible. Ancient technologies long forgotten and locked up, manuscripts, manuals, books, and more filled with ancient knowledge written down by the dwarves of the old empire before the collapse. Much of the technology seems to dated to the time of the War of Ages, where the dwarves fought against the armies of the precursor elf Ducaniel. \nThe question now remains: should we formalize a branch of the state to focus on perfecting this technology?"
dwarven_monuments_vaulthold.1.a: "The secrets of the Vaulthold shall serve the state!"
dwarven_monuments_vaulthold.1.b: "It would be unwise to disturb this ancient technology. Best leave it be."
dwarven_monuments_vaulthold.1.c: "Artificery? Why, we already have artificery!"
dwarven_monuments_vaulthold.1.e: "Even though we already know of this technology, we can put the contents of the vault to use."
