Their story was ancient by the time of Aul-Dwarov, and the rise and fall of that great empire only left behind more tragedies and tales of grandeur. Inspired by the heroes of old, many dwarves look towards the Dwarovar, All-Dwarves-Home, in order to reclaim the history and lands they have lost."

   HOLY_SITE_4119_DESC:0 "Amldihr, meaning Gates of the Assembly, was where the united empire of Aul-Dwarov was founded. It was where the Dwarovkron was forged to unify all dwarfkind, and it was where the High Assembly of Holds met to advise its bearer. It was also where the surface terrace farms of the Serpent's Vale were managed, in which the High King could feed all his subjects food to sustain themselves in the dark depths of the mountain."
   HOLY_SITE_4311_DESC:0 "Grônstunad wasn’t the first hold founded after the Tree of Stone was breached, but no doubt one of the wealthiest. It grew quickly, overflowing with deposits of jade that were extracted and shipped west, creating a ‘jade rush’ composed of dwarves looking to find such a great deposit, or escape the dwarven wars of unification in the west. Eventually the west fell to the new orc menace and Grônstunad became the greatest Dwarven city in existence... for a time. By the time the surviving dwarves of the west regained the confidence to make contact with the east Grônstunad was no more, and was now the home of the hobgoblin race."
   HOLY_SITE_2931_DESC:0 "Er-Natvir was not only one of the core cities of the Dwarovar, but also the hub in which all rails sprouted from. All goods passing through to and from the capital passed through this hold, and the libraries, holding uncountable trade records, are a beautiful site to behold- a testament of Dwarven organization. Even in the final days of this city, goods were still recorded- mostly arms."
   HOLY_SITE_4078_DESC:0 "Named after Hehogrim the Diligent, Hehodovar was where many of the first holds were designed and architected. Based at the centre of the Dwarovar, it was allegedly the first capital of the dwarven peoples but by the time of unification it had become a place of the practical arts of crafting and building."
   HOLY_SITE_2963_DESC:0 "Jorkad Hall was a hold of no importance... until one day a dark scourge emerged from its depths. These beasts were named after the hold itself, but to the greater world, they were known by a simpler name: Orcs. Deadlier than the goblins that had infested the mountains, the orcish threat brought doom to upon dwarves. Since that day, dwarfkind lost their dominion over the mountains, and over the millennia more and more holds would perish under the orcish menace."
   HOLY_SITE_4093_DESC:0 "Arg-Ôrdstun was the capital of the Serpentreach, who in its day was oft unified against the High King of Aul-Dwarov.

   HOLY_SITE_4269_DESC:0 "It was said that Halanna, the Earthmother, created the first dwarves in Earthseed, and it was with their help that the fine details of the world were perfected.

Ravelianists are part-scholar, part-preacher, and believe in unraveling the secrets of the world to discover and spread its fundamental Truths. A large number of these revelations come from their research in the God Fragment, a strange shard-like device that communicates in a near-undecipherable language that claims that it is the last portion of divinity, and that the precursor elves stole God's divinity and turned it into what we know today as magic. A popular tenet in the Ravelian faith is their wish to use artificery to bring this stolen magic to all."

Furthermore, our earnest embrace of these musics, along with the incorporation of the Skalds' songs into our worship has inspired some among their number to share the secrets of their bardic magics, which inspire our people and bolster our armies."

Their gods are all but gone, left in scraps and pieces spread apart through all their kind, their essences shattered to pieces and sitting in the gullets of every ogre and troll. Yet even in this state, gods are difficult to kill, and there are shamans that today sense their presence, even if only partly so: their half-digested consciousnesses stretched out in a void between sentience and oblivion, referred to as a collective mass, a maw of terror that whispers into its shamans' ears sweet and terrible nothings, asking only that their chosen may eat and eat for they no longer can."

But the believers of a certain cult not only accept its existence but outright claim it is a pale underling to the true heaven of the goblins: the titular Kravi Oznad, a beyond greater than even heaven.\n\nThis coveted greater heaven is whatever one desires, an endless amount of it in a plane of plenty that stretches further beyond what one can see, the only way one can achieve invitation to this heaven beyond heavens however is to die in a most goblinlike manner, and only that way. All goblin believers of this cult are to take arms, ride upon the battlefield and slay all those who oppose the goblin way of life, by any means necessary. Whether it be dying of a misfire in the heat of battle, the explosion of an ill-timed missile, or simple slaying at the hands of a dwarf or otherwise after having killed tens of others, death is the only way to surpass the mediocre afterlife and achieve the heaven a goblin man or woman truly deserves!"

Followers of this philosophy are uninterested by spirituality; instead focusing on creating and refining a “Theory of Everything” that explains exactly how reality works. Members are driven to observe and analyse the material world, in the hopes of being able to incorporate their discoveries to the doctrine in an act known as “Being touched by The Thought”. This drive towards material analysis and innovation leads to followers of the Thought being well-suited to the pursuit of scientific advancement and the development of artifice; gnomish believers in the Thought were the first to combine magic and science into the art now known as artificery. Those who follow The Thought are usually very tolerant to other ways of thinking, as they both hold the product of other people’s intelligence in high regard, and take advantage of the opportunity to research into other cultures."

The beliefs of Möitsäliusko, meaning “spirits of the forest”, are varied, and they differ from tribe to tribe. One thing they have in common is reverence of wise crones, generally the oldest women in the village, who serve as a spiritual medium between the material world and the world of the spirits."

    kazraiel:0 "Kazraiel"
    kazraiel_desc:0 "Kazraiel, the Wroth Prince, was created when Castellos attempted to absorb the divine energy of his brother, Agrados, yet was himself corrupted instead - he cast the corrupted portion of himself, alongside that which he had taken from Agrados, to the Lower Planes where it would eventually gain self-awareness as the Archdevil Kazraiel.\n\nKazraiel is the most aggressive of the Archdevils, known for his great rages and constant desire for conflict, yet past his outward berserker-like mannerisms is an understanding of how to wage war matched by none. He considers himself heir of Agrados and Castellos alike and rightful master of both their peoples, the Alenics and the Escanni."

    mesner_desc:0 "Masner, the Lord of Sloth, was formerly the god of travel and communication and was cast to the Lower Planes by Castellos for his failure to act on behalf of either side of the Godswar. He is perhaps the most bitter of the Archdevils, firmly believing he has done nothing wrong, and has aligned himself with Kazraiel who he considers to also be unfairly condemned.\n\nAs the former god of communication, and earning his title as the Lord of Sloth, he is the Archdevil most capable of speaking directly to those on the Material Plane - whispering thoughts of apathy, sorrow or the pointlessness of their deeds to those he targets, sapping their wills."
    ildran:0 "Ildran"

For now, he satisfies himself by sending visions of glorious monuments to those who follow him, all while still dreaming of his promised new world inhabited only by his favored humans."

    hedine_desc:0 "Hedine, the Mistress of Lust, was formerly the goddess of joy and was blamed for encouraging Agrados' lust for Halanna. Hedine was feared as the most convincing of the Agradosian Host, for though she lacked the rhetorical skills of Ildran, she always knew exactly how to tempt someone one-on-one.\n\nShe was also despised by many avariels for being the only Archdevil to seduce her avariel attendants into following her, transforming them into her succubi."
    ibberal:0 "Ibberal"
    ibberal_desc:0 "Ibberal, the Grand Duke of Gluttony, was formerly the god of celebrations. He was a minor god in the winning faction of Castellos, but later began a conspiracy to poison Castellos and other major gods, blame it on remaining loyalists to Agrados, and establish himself as well as co-conspirators Canturian and Forsara as the new Triune ruling the gods.\n\nThis would fail and he, and his co-conspirators, would be banished to the Lower Planes. The three would remain close allies, calling themselves the Triad and generally cooperating closely to make up for their weakness compared to the other four Archdevils."

    canturian_desc:0 "Canturian, the Baron of Envy, was formerly the god of music and theater and a loyalist to Castellos until he was cast to the Lower Realms for taking part in a conspiracy, led by Ibberal, to poison Castellos at a victory feast.\n\nHe would go on to be the most active member of the Triad formed with his co-conspirators, claiming to have made possible the creation of the first Cannorian vampires. While the truth of this statement can't really be determined, Canturian is known for granting his followers boons at the expense of those they are jealous of, and this would fit that pattern."
    forsara:0 "Forsara"
    forsara_desc:0 "Forsara, the Countess of Greed, was formerly the goddess of luck and charity and remained loyal to Castellos during the Godswar before being banished to the Lower Planes for her part in a conspiracy, alongside Ibberal and Canturian, to poison him and usurp his place as ruler of the gods.\n\nHer devils are perhaps responsible for the stereotype of the devil who makes outwardly fair, but secretly treacherous, deals."

 desc_trial_by_combat:0 "An ancient ritual in the Xianjie, where one can settle a dispute with another Righteous Master through a trial by combat. While not strictly to the death, many of these fights end up with dead Masters due to the mastery of dangerous martial prowess. While there’s less monks to pick from to form the bulk of our armies due to such dangerous practices, one can be ensured that the monks who survive, are the cream of the crop."

Perhaps we should follow suit, and this is the path forward through history?"

 desc_teachings_of_balris:0 "Balris taught the Goldscales many things, from an appreciation of the fine arts to philosophical lessons. Since His disappearance, countless of statues, temples and shrines have been built in His honour, and their maintenance is paid for by the many kobolds donating some of their shed gold scales, which are then used to pay for repairs."

 desc_meditation_and_tea:0 "It is said that in Yanshen, tea is as ubiquitous in houses as water is, and while the saying is dubious in truth, it is undeniable tea is an essential part of Yanshen's culture. Mainly it is used during meditation hours, used to assist the Yan in spiritual enhancement and health. This process is so important that nations even assign hours of the day dedicated for such a practice, although time spent meditating is also time spent not working."

 desc_vow_of_poverty:0 "A vow that every Eunuch takes during their initial examinations, where failure to properly administer their assigned region after becoming a Eunuch means to swear off all their possessions and become a wandering hobo.

 desc_kobold_house_pets:0 "Golden Kobolds have been seen as a sign of good fortune since their introduction to Haless, which has prompted many families to keep them around as pets as charms for their wealth. Many scholars seem to believe that this tradition specifically occurred after the sighting of Balris throughout Yanshen and the subsequent groups of kobolds trying to follow its path. Balris was, for many Yan, considered to be Yanhe’s return, and so by acquiring a Golden kobold one could replicate the fortune of seeing Yanshen’s dragon of old. This tradition, however, has also come at a risk for independent Golden Kobolds, as if they aren’t careful they could be kidnapped at any point to be made a pet. These problems are not uncommon enough to dismiss, and the state must make sure their citizens aren’t being kidnapped in order to be novelty prizes."
 equal_inheritance:0 "Equal Inheritance"
 desc_equal_inheritance:0 "An ancient Kai law ever since the early days of the Phonan tribes, dictates that whenever the patriarch of the family dies, their land and wealth is split equally amongst their children. This law arose from the belief that if a child becomes greedy and cheats his siblings after the passing of their parent, the father will return as a vengeful spirit and curse the family line. By mandating this age-old tradition, rulers are able to lessen the cost of governing territory, with the caveat that they have less direct control of their territories."

 desc_remembrance_festivals:0 "Thidinkai is known for its large celebrations for remembering their ancestors who live on in spirit form. To the Kai, they are the product of those who came before them and eventually will live amongst their ancestors as a spirit, so maintaining respect for those who came before is paramount. These celebrations are massive in scale, with funeral rites performed such as cleaning gravestones for the dead who have no family remaining and burning spirit paper to ensure the safety of one’s ancestors to the spirit realm. A big part of these festivals are the invitation of Shamans from across the Thidinkai region, who can help communicate with the dead in order for families to gain closure, helping to bind the Kai people together during this time of peace."

One and both are the same.\n\nThe gods of the old world are false, for they are merely mages masquerading as something more. But do not lament, for hope is not lost. The Doctrine teaches us that power is magic, and magic, unlike divinity, knows no master and harbours no biases or grudges. It is by this truth that the Demesne liberates the world."
