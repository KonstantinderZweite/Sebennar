#Events 
flavor_emberscar.1.t:0 "Dragonnel Hunt"
flavor_emberscar.1.d:0 "Our ruler is experienced with war and conflict but infighting is something so difficult to quell. Killing some of the rebel leaders will only lead to martyrs for their cause. There is only one option that spills the least amount of blood. There is a dragonnel wild and dangerous that has killed man after man. This is a beast known throught all land rebel controlled or not. Slaying this beast will show our rulers strength and quell disastifaction from our populace especially from the newly conquered. Only one artist has reproduced a piece showcasing the dragonnel."
flavor_emberscar.1.b:0 "Onward to death or glory."
flavor_emberscar.2.t:0 "Deaths Embrace"
flavor_emberscar.2.d:0 "Hours shifted to days and days to weeks our journey to find this dragonnel was a one filled with danger large portions of the party already dead. The journey through desolate areas of our land took great will and even greater luck to find our target. Hope was what kept our group marching forward to what felt like a one end of our land to the other. Finally we had caught sight of the dragonnel we have been searching for."
flavor_emberscar.2.b:0 "The dragonnel sleeps in the cave let us try our luck"
flavor_emberscar.3.t:0 "A Dragonnels Last Breath"
flavor_emberscar.3.d:0 "We charged with spears double our size with tips full of poison. Each hobgoblin had fear etched into them as the dragonnel opened its eyes just as we stabbed towards its long throat and chest. In a split second the dragonnel spasmed rapidly launching large portions of the group to a wall many heads indented the cave walls that day. However in the end after the dragonnel killed a few of the men it had died to it numerous wounds on its neck. Relief was present on all those that had survived the nightmare that was fighting this beast. Finally our great leader could showcase the body and sell the pieces for a good profit. From now on they are also known as the first Dragonnel Hunter."
flavor_emberscar.3.b:0 "Perhaps with these funds and glory we can unify our people even more"
flavor_emberscar.4.t:0 "Caution or Agression"
flavor_emberscar.4.d:0 "Throughout the days of our search for the mythical dragonnel the grounds around us have shaken almost like a warning sign to what is to come. We have already caught sign of the dragonnels location. Perhaps we should approach this with a bit more caution. "
flavor_emberscar.5.d:0 "Corpses topped with the stench of rot was all we saw on our path to the dragonnel. Such a vile creature must not be allowed to live. This task will be difficult the path forward the dragonnels head will likely require much effort. Should we approach and kill it as cautiously as possible or do we charged forward to end this beast whatever the cause."
flavor_emberscar.6.d:0 "Corpses of animals were strone across the path towards the burning monument of a cave this dragonnel lived in. Smoke was present throughout his entrance but a job was a job. We need to kill this fiery beast so that the people can no peace and we can get some use out of its corpse. "
flavor_emberscar.7.d:0 "Floods were a present danger as we headed towards this beast. Many could lose their lives dealing with a beast with powers unknown to the general populace. This beast has already caused turmoil throughout our northern territory. His dwelling by the lake showcase his interesting affinity."
flavor_emberscar.8.d:0 "The minds of the party were muddled. Our speech was imapcted greatly and fear was prevelant. How can we defeat this beast with our minds in this much of a mess? Something is for certain with this endevaor the consquences of this slaying could be unpredictable."
flavor_emberscar.4.b:0 "Death!"
flavor_emberscar.4.c:0 "Dishonor...."
flavor_emberscar.9.t:0 "Warnings of The Great Flood"
flavor_emberscar.9.d:0 "Our people must be prepared for the danger coming towards them. Perhaps they can negate most of the negatives that come with the disaster."
flavor_emberscar.9.b:0 "Pray"
flavor_emberscar.11.t:0 "Duel of the Fates"
flavor_emberscar.11.d:0 "The anticpation of death was etched in the air. The nerves of the two fighters were apparent but these two hobgoblins were talented leaders one the great ruler of Emberscar and the other a general that unified the people agianst our emperor. Whoever wins this fate will determine the level of autonomy given to the people for years to come."

flavor_emberscar.13.t:0 "Earth Melding"
flavor_emberscar.13.d:0 "A blade was protruding from the dragonnel the blood a solid brown. Its eyes bloated and its body was sprayed with the blood of his own and the blood of the hobgoblins. Each of the party were shaking in excitement and fear. They were of tough breed but even they had never had to deal with a dragonnel such as this one."
flavor_emberscar.13.b:0 "A blade made of mud?"
flavor_emberscar.14.t:0 "Rotten Victory"
flavor_emberscar.14.d:0 "An arm a leg a foot a hand. Sacrafices must be made for progress. Many of the hogblins under our ruler suffered this fate even our glorious ruler suffered from this happenstance. Perhaps his could recover a bit easier than the others as his was only partially ruined."
flavor_emberscar.14.b:0  "A pure black helmet?"
flavor_emberscar.15.t:0 "Drought Protection "
flavor_emberscar.15.d:0 "We have achieved victory even with a monsterous fiery beast. With this acomplishment this beast will no longer impact the innocent people of Emberscar. Well these will be the results of the people not burnt to a toasty ground."
flavor_emberscar.15.b:0 " Why is the shield constantly on fire?"
flavor_emberscar.16.t:0 "Flood Prevention"
flavor_emberscar.16.d:0 "Coughing was heard throughout the room as those that dealt with the dragonnel almost suffered a fate that none would envy. Thankfully the spear through the little guys throat stopped any of these individuals meeting a less than timely end."
flavor_emberscar.16.b:0 "This armor is very slick"
flavor_emberscar.17.t:0 "Blooming High"
flavor_emberscar.17.d:0 "A burst of spores came from the dead dragonnel. Our king was right in the path of this unfourtante release. His stature changed rapidly and a convulsion went through his body. The results of this could be unpredictable."
flavor_emberscar.17.b:0 "A potion ?"
flavor_emberscar.18.t:0 "Crunched masses "
flavor_emberscar.18.d:0 "Crunching was all that was heard that day in the cave. Bones melding together as an arm cojoined to a leg and the heads of many were made into one. What was left of the party was a mess and would lead to a trauma for any survivors of the party. Our ruler sadly was not one of those lucky few his body was adjoined with his other comrades."
flavor_emberscar.18.b:0 "The hobgoblin remaining party still fear the sights of boulders to this day"
flavor_emberscar.19.t:0 "Rotten Flesh"
flavor_emberscar.19.d:0 "Each man from the expedition felt their life slip away as they charged the beast. Each one that was caught by the beast had their skin peeled by forces beyond anyones understanding. Our leader was no different. His arms and legs were the first to decay. A black tar substance was what was left from those limbs. Until finally he was no more. Just a goop on the floor. Nonetheless some still managed to escape from what was certain death."
flavor_emberscar.19.b:0 "Death is the only destiny for those that seek this dragonnel"
flavor_emberscar.20.t:0 "Flamming Husk"
flavor_emberscar.20.d:0 "Screams and the smell of melting flesh was what filled the cave of the fire dragonnel. What was this monstroity. Dragonnels were never meant to breathe and handle fire. What secrets did this mosnter hold. Whatever the case the melted flesh of the men did not reveal the secrets of this beast. Even the monster of a man our ruler was this was not enough to stop their gruesome fiery fate."
flavor_emberscar.20.b:0 "The lungs of the remaining party were never the same"
flavor_emberscar.21.t:0 "Watery Grave"
flavor_emberscar.21.d:0 "A suffocating feeling was all that was felt from the failed attack. Water from the dragonnel grabbed the throats of the men charging it. The tundrels of water wrapped around their mouth and forcefully split apart their throats from the outside in. The aftermath of the retreating forces was full of those terrified seeing their many comrades die a horrible watery death. One of those that died was our great ruler. His death was even more disgusting than the others as the water from the dragonnel pierced through him skewering him."
flavor_emberscar.21.b:0 "Many drowned after travel we believe this is now as dry drowning"
flavor_emberscar.22.t:0 "Looming High"
flavor_emberscar.22.d:0 "We have failed to conquer this dragonnel. None of us have died however The cave the Dragonnel lives in is filled with plants that have signifcantly altered the people that have chased this dragonnel. This includes even our own ruler. The sluring of their words and the drool was not the most pleaseant of sights although the worst of the effects seem to be temporary."
flavor_emberscar.22.b:0 "Oooh oooh ooh?"
flavor_emberscar.24.t:0 "The Blood Soaked Dynasty"
flavor_emberscar.24.d:0 "Blood flowed through every pore of the hobgoblin ruler. The pain great the location unkown but all the great ruler of Emberscar could feel was a never ending pain as his body slowly adapted to whatever was happening to the poor fellow. By the time his majesty had awoken a cave was all that could be seen. A cave where a dragonnel once thrived."
flavor_emberscar.24.b:0 "What has happened to me?"
flavor_emberscar.25.t:0 "Tactical Meteor Incoming"
flavor_emberscar.25.d:0 "The time is here we can help direct the coming disaster through two of the southern parts of our great river. Who do we decide must suffer the consequences of the flood? The flooding will provide great cover for an invasion. We should use whoever gets hit as a target for spreading our great empire. Perhaps they will be too distractd to see our forces march upon them"
flavor_emberscar.25.b:0 "To those dirty dwarfs"
flavor_emberscar.25.c:0 "To the Command"
flavor_emberscar.26.t:0 "Mineral Haven"
