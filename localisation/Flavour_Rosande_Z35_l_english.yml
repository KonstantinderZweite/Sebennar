 rosande_knights_shady_pasts_title:0 "Knights of Bloody Honour"
 rosande_knights_shady_pasts_desc:0 "Across Cannor knighthood can mean many things. In our case it has meant years of unrelenting conflict, departing from our homelands in exile and pledging our swords to Escanni battles. We have sorely missed the days of tourneys, of courtly gossip and scandalous affairs, of idleness and celebration - but we have discarded such luxuries. Instead we have forged ourselves into weapons of war, learned to adopt new techniques that fit these new lands. \n\nEscann will remain a land of war, it seems, and so we will remain knights at war. If we fight long and fight hard though, perhaps it can be made a land of luxury as well. "

 rosande_rattling_chains_title:0 "Rattling of Chains"
 rosande_rattling_chains_desc:0 "“Knight Commander Davinor had ridden out today with a company of his knights to rout a local orcish warband. I was unsurprised to see him return in good order, with a well-bloodied blade and a smoke-scorched gauntlet. I was, however, surprised to see his knights escorting several dozen of those monstrous warriors with them, one of his captains urging the most defiant forward with a spear. They shepherded them towards the barn, and locked them in the kennels while me and the other pages came forth to tend the horses. \n\nWe were discussing why they’d been taken back alive while we were taking in the horses. Louis was claiming we were going to kill them ourselves - ‘get a taste for orcblood’ - but the older boys were boasting about how many they’d take. Sir Seyres told us that they’d been taken to work. That knights were meant to be more than fighters, that we were meant to protect the innocent and restore the lands. By clapping these brutes in irons we were keeping the innocent safe, and setting their labour to a worthier cause… most of the others lost interest when it was clear the lesson wasn’t about bloodletting, but I really do think this is cleverer than that…”"

 rosande_nobility_disgraced_title:0 "Nobility of the Disgraced"
 rosande_nobility_disgraced_desc:0 "Their names were infamous: Francis “Falseheart” offered a courtly exchange of wines with their Sorncosti foe the day before battle, only to seal the doors and burn the vineyard down with them inside. Gelmon “The Greedy” fought long and hard throughout the war, then killed his wife’s family so they could not reclaim their lands in Rubenaire as it surrendered. Pedain “Pursestrings” kept the Duke’s forces fed throughout the Derranic campaign; can he be blamed for the frosts that autumn and the commoners that starved in their wake? They thought us despicable - bastards and worse - but we won these battles while our lords plotted surrender. Whatever stories they tell of us, whatever revenge we took on those that had slighted us, the losers in such a conflict would have been punished with death. The prizes for our victories… exile. \n\nIf they wish to say we are devils or tyrants or Kazriel’s own spawn, then they may. But we are the ones who won, and we do not mean to stop now. We will forge a nobility that seeks victory, free of self imposed shackles, superior to anything those smug Lencori fools could ever muster."

 rosande_knights_rosande_title:0 "Knights Rósande"
 rosande_knights_rosande_desc:0 "Most of our knights and almost all of our captains first whetted their blades during the Lilac wars, and between the members of our order we’ve seen every theater of that conflict. We’ve crossed lances with Deranne’s Seaflower knights, hunted rebels through the vineyards of Wine Lords, and besieged ruined towns throughout the Damesear. These experiences will put us well in store crossing lances with wayward knights, hunting goblins through tangled hedgerows and putting orcish war camps to the torch. \n\nThe Rose knights sneered at us when we were exiled. Let them watch as we apply their teachings better than they ever did, and carve out a kingdom of our own."

 rosande_knightly_slave_hunters_title:0 "Knightly Slave Hunters"
 rosande_knightly_slave_hunters_desc:0 "Much of the lands claimed by our brave knights in recent years are still utterly devoid of any sign of civilization, harboring only marauding hosts of orcish warbands left behind by the Greentide. To restore the proper order of things much hard work is needed, and who better to carry out this needful task than those who despoiled these tormented lands in the first place? \n\nThe most courageous amongst our knights are regularly sent out to vanquish the orcs still squatting in our domain, and those who do not fall beneath our blades are given the merciful chance to atone for their sins by restoring what was lost. We shall not rest until justice has been properly meted out."

 rosande_grape_corvee_title:0 "Grape Corvée"
 rosande_grape_corvee_desc:0 " Unlike our former home, with its bustling towns and fertile farmlands, the lands of Escann are wild and untamed, still recovering from the cataclysm of the Greentide. The amount of work required to return them to a semblance of their former splendor would be a daunting task even for the prosperous realms in western Cannor, and even more so for a small group of pioneers, no matter how courageous and tenacious they might be. \n\nBut let it not be said that we falter in the face of adversity, for we have developed an ingenious solution to this issue. The grape corvée is a complex set of obligations and rules under which our local nobles provide the labor of their orcish slaves for a limited period of time, so they may work on projects deemed of importance for the realm as a whole. \n\nWhile our esteemed nobles of course agree with the notion that orcs belong to a race suited only to manual labor and are destined to serve their betters, some of them might chafe at the notion that ‘their’ orcs are not at their complete disposal all of the time."

 rosande_silvermere_wine_title:0 "SIlvermere Wine"
 rosande_silvermere_wine_desc:0 "Back in our old homelands the gently rolling hills all around the Bay of Wines are covered with innumerable vineyards, producing the finest vintages known to man. Though at first glance the hilly landscape of southern Escann might not seem like wine country, it surely is capable of bearing a rich harvest of fine wine. Its fertile ground is protected from the north winds by the Serpentspine, and enjoys the climate-stabilising effect of the waters of lake Silvermere. \n\nBy joining our vast experience in winemaking with the strength of our orcish servants we shall endeavor to turn this vision into a flourishing reality. Soon our Silvermere wine will conquer the dinner tables of noble houses, as well as the counters of taverns all over Cannor."

 rosande_noble_fashion_title:0 "Noble Fashion"
 rosande_noble_fashion_desc:0 "If there is one thing indelibly associated with the nobility of our Lencori homelands it is that they are always at the forefront of fashion, pioneering and defining the trends that will dominate the rest of Cannor for decades afterwards. \n\nIt is therefore a great source of shame for the nobles amongst our ranks, exiled as they are in these untamed lands, that we currently suffer from a distinct lack of weavers, tailors and embroiderers to supply us with the finery they are accustomed to. This deplorable state of affairs simply cannot persist for much longer, so we should focus our efforts on building up a domestic supply of fashionable clothing suited to their lofty ranks. \n\nUnlike the many other tasks performed in our lands, this delicate labor cannot be accomplished by the coarse hands of orcs; we must therefore entice skilled laborers from more civilized domains to start a new life in Rósande."

 rosande_the_crimson_forge_title:0 "The Crimson Forge"
 rosande_the_crimson_forge_desc:0 "What is a knight without blade and armor? Surely still a skilled fighter, but in the end little better than a combative peasant. Therefore one of our most important duties is the steady supply of our growing number of knights with the martial tools of their noble trade. Luckily for us, the hills of Escann are teeming with sources of iron; it need only be extracted by our plentiful orcish labor. \n\nEqually fortuitously for us, there are some blacksmiths originating from Deranne amongst our ranks, who learned their trade at the famous Daromsforge. With the proper resources, sufficient assistant labor in the form of orcish blacksmiths and a steady supply of iron ore and charcoal sourced from the wooded hills of our new home, they are confident that we can build our own Crimson Forge - one that will soon be able to forge weapons and armor of comparable quality. And their first attempts seem to have confirmed their claim, producing sharp blades and sturdy suits of armor, tinted crimson-black due to the peculiar ore found in these lands."

 rosande_sour_taste_title:0 "Sour Taste"
 rosande_sour_taste_desc:0 "The benefits of an enslaved orcish workforce have long been apparent to us, but unfortunately, others have started to realize them as well. What was at first only a negligible trickle has turned into a rushing stream of slaves leaving our borders to be shipped down the Alen and Dostanesck and across the sea to far-flung destinations. While of course their owners are perfectly free to do with their orcish property as they see fit, this drain has reached a volume by which the future prosperity of our realm might be endangered. \n\nWe need to reach a gentleman’s agreement with the slave traders, so they do not abscond with more of our slaves than can be replaced naturally. Surely they will show sense and agree to our conditions, especially if the lavish feasts we have planned at our capital have put them in an agreeable mood."

 rosande_clearing_flank_title:0 "Clearing our Flank"
 rosande_clearing_flank_desc:0 "The heartlands of our new realm, forged in the aftermath of the Greentide, lie in the gentle rolling hills and verdant plains south of lake Silvermere. While many parts have become civilized in the last decades due to the unrelenting efforts of our brave settlers, some parts are still infested with savage unchained orcs and goblins. \n\nNot only does this go against the divinely ordained order, but in some parts of our realm, particularly where our former brethren from the Stalwart Band made their home after they submitted to our rightful rule, a frankly unbecoming degree of familiarity between greenskins and their human betters has been observed. \n\nWhat have they done to receive such undeserved mercy and unwarranted compassion? This has to be stopped before it gets out of hand - the orc needs to learn his proper place and we are the ones equipped to teach him."

 rosande_dreams_of_grandeur_title:0 "Dreams of Grandeur"
 rosande_dreams_of_grandeur_desc:0 "Tilling the ravaged land, rebuilding what was lost, meting out justice for an unimaginable crime are all noble endeavors. But they are not enough. While our founders have seen the marvels of royal Lorentainé, the pleasure palaces along the Bloodwine and the ornate merchant residences in the rich trading ports of the Bay of Wines for themselves, the first generation born here in Rósande knows these wonders only from stories, and is instead experiencing only the desolation left behind by the savagery of the orcs. \n\nThis has to be remedied if we do not want to risk losing an essential part of our heritage. It is our most noble obligation to bring culture and civilization to this benighted part of Cannor by sharing our rich cultural heritage with those less fortunate. \n\nLet us turn Ionntrás into a true marvel of this new age, a city of marble, rose gardens and gilded palaces, eclipsing even the splendor of our former homeland. This is a task that may well occupy several generations, but what more worthy goal is there?"

 rosande_the_crimson_palace_title:0 "The Crimson Palace"
 rosande_the_crimson_palace_desc:0 "The Dostanesck is like a gushing wound, bleeding our lifeforce with every slaver barge departing for the slaver ports along the flooded coast. In order to stem the bleeding we need to control the ancient Castanorian citadel of Bal Dostan, in recent times renamed Arca Corvur by its Corvurian inhabitants. It sits on a promontory above the river shore at the narrow point between the craggy Godshield mountains, the impassable Dreadmire and the impermeable wilderness of the Deepwoods - by holding it we can determine who is allowed to travel downstream and who is not. \n\nBut it would be a deplorable waste to use this formidable fortress only as a glorified toll station. With our unique sense of style and flair, we may turn the dour architecture left by the Corvurians into a veritable Crimson Palace, where our esteemed nobility can celebrate lavish festivities in a surrounding worthy of their exalted station."

 rosande_no_orc_shall_leave_title:0 "No Orc Shall Leave"
 rosande_no_orc_shall_leave_desc:0 "They steal our orcs and then they insult our wine…how shameless. The attitude of their diplomats show us only one thing; the slave traders are not the sort of company with whom we should waste time negotiating. It is a pity, for there was potential for a fruitful relationship between our realms; our wine overflowing some of the finest ports in Cannor, being sold all across the continent, just imagine the prestige… \n\nNo matter. If those egotistical, short-sighted and impolite morons refuse to cooperate, we have no choice but to take the matters into our own hands, for we will not watch as our workforce slips from our grasp. We must seal shut the slave trade going west and never again allow another orc to be taken from their homes, or to be set on a vessel headed for a distant land! The slave trade will crumble as fast as it began, and people shall know that Rósande was the one to end it."

 rosande_rid_the_ancient_title:0 "Rid The Ancient"
 rosande_rid_the_ancient_desc:0 "The City of Stone, cradle of humanity’s first and greatest empire, once stood as the crowning achievement of combined human and dwarven ingenuity. Its grand towers, home to the patrician elite, rose high above the teeming markets of the lower city, casting long shadows over a metropolis alive with trade and ambition. From every corner of the known world, merchants brought their wares to Castonath, transforming it into a vibrant hub of commerce. The roar of brokering voices filled the air, rivaled only by the clamorous symphony of hammers hitting anvils in the Dragon Forge to the east. There, the smiths crafted the finest weapons and armor, their masterful artistry renowned far and wide. \n\nBut those days are gone, squandered by the weak. Castonath, once the envy of all, has rotted into a carcass of its former greatness, abandoned to centuries of mediocrity and disgrace. What was once the beating heart of an empire now wallows in its own decay—a deteriorating remembrance of an age made up of greater men. \n\nWe shall be the only remedy. Prepare the knights to mount, and ready the cannons to sunder their graying walls. It is our duty to see that the inhabitants of Castonath are saved from themselves, so that the city’s old prosperity can live on in our vision."

 rosande_griffon_lords_title:0 "Home of the Griffon Lords"
 rosande_griffon_lords_desc:0 "Nestled within and beneath the foothills and lower ranges of the Serpentspine, the famed Marrhold, constructed in a long bygone age by dwarven master masons and architects, has become the heart of the realm founded by the valiant Marrodics after their wanderings had brought them to Escann. The famed griffon riders soar high above the mountain peaks, guarding all entrances to this stronghold. \n\nIt would be a folly of the highest order to waste the lives of our brave knights trying to force this rugged land of tenacious warriors, who even withstood the might of the Greentide horde, to completely submit to us and discard their cherished traditions. Instead we should grant them some degree of autonomy in their internal affairs, in return for loyal vassalage and a steady supply of the precious mineral wealth their mountainous home possesses."

 rosande_eclipsing_old_title:0 "Eclipsing the Old"
 rosande_eclipsing_old_desc:0 " It was always our destiny to rule over these lands, but it is nonetheless satisfying to see the pale rose of Rósande wave from fortress towers all over southern Escann. While we are the undisputed master of all that lies between Godshield and Serpentspine, Deepwoods and Silverainé, our reputation has not yet eclipsed the fame of those realms who ruled over these lands before us. \n\nThe Blademarches in particular continue to inspire the many youngsters who dream of one day being worthy of wielding the fabled gleaming blade Calindal. In recent times, rumors have spread that remnants of the secretive order of Blade Stewards survived the fall of the Blademarches during the Greentide, guarding Calindal until someone worthy of the blade appears to wield it. We are of course the only ones truly worthy of it, having restored the Bladeskeep to its former glory and proven worthy heirs of the martial traditions of the Blademarches. This decrepit order should see the truth to our claim, and if they do not, we should make them, lest they encourage a deluded pretender to the throne of the Blademarches."

 rosande_overflowing_the_market_title:0 "Overflowing The Market"
 rosande_overflowing_the_market_desc:0 "No longer do the slave barges travel down the Alen and Dostanesck, taking their precious cargo away from their rightful place laboring in our plantations and mines. Our nobility obliges us to look out even for the least among us, and thanks to our efforts our slaves no longer have to fear being torn from their families and separated from their true purpose due to being sold to a new uncaring master on faraway shores. \n\nOur control of these vital trade arteries not only allows us to stop slaver-barons from poaching our workforce, but also comes with an unique opportunity. We can now finally export our homegrown vintages to the markets in western Cannor without having greedy middlemen cutting into our profits. Let us show the rest of the world that our wines need not fear comparison with the established vintages of the west."

 rosande_knights_steed_title:0 "A Knights' Steed"
 rosande_knights_steed_desc:0 "The vast grassy plains of western Escann were once the home of the paragons of knighthood in chivalric Escann. The valorous knights of Adenica and their trusty steeds are still a venerable staple used by storytellers all over Cannor. But all their renown did not save them from the savage Greentide. \n\nNow their former lands are in our hands, and we have taken it upon ourselves to breed the last remaining herds of their famed Adenican Coursers to provide our own knights with steeds of suitable pedigree."

 rosande_grandest_winery_title:0 "The Grandest Winery"
 rosande_grandest_winery_desc:0 "The ruins of Castonath have by now been mostly restored to their former purpose, but many had to be torn down as they were irreparable. With the space thus freed in the formerly densely settled metropolis, some of our adventurous winemakers have proposed turning these patches of land into vineyards, taking advantage of the gentle climate prevailing within the walls of Castonath. \n\nOnce this ambitious project has been completed, Castonath will be the grandest winery in all of Cannor, a central hub from which to distribute the fruits of the labor of our orcish slaves to customers all over Cannor and beyond."

 rosande_greatest_to_fall_title:0 "The Greatest to Fall"
 rosande_greatest_to_fall_desc:0 "We now hold the former heartlands of both august Castanor and chivalrous Castellyr. While the former fell due to a perfidious rot within and the strength of conviction found in the League of Free Realms, the latter was utterly drowned by the Greentide. All their vaunted honor and nobility did nothing to prevent this from happening. The question thus remains: was their chivalry a source of strength, or rather a fatal weakness they could not overcome in time? \n\nTheir lands are now ours to rule as we see fit and we shall not repeat the mistakes of the past - we will not let what we have built up from the ground turn to ashes due to a misplaced reluctance to do what is necessary."

 rosande_eternal_ball_title:0 "The Eternal Ball"
 rosande_eternal_ball_desc:0 "The tables are ready, and the wine barrels brim to their staves. For years, the former citadel of Bal Dostan—now transformed into the resplendent Crimson Palace—has been meticulously readied by the crown itself to host the most magnificent feast in the history of Rósande. Every noble house is invited, and even the slave owners, for this one night, have eagerly set aside their duties. They trust, after all, that the orcs will continue their toil tirelessly, working until their hands grow numb and beyond; for that is the purpose they serve. The music starts, the wine flows, the guests gorge on the bountiful foods, and the gossip reverberates in the grand halls, for the ball set to be remembered for a lifetime begins."

 rosande_hangover_title:0 "Hangover"
 rosande_hangover_desc:0 "Everyone who’s anyone knows that the one reliable sign of a truly great feast is the enormous, head-splitting headache afterwards. Things get tricky, however, when it is not just individuals, but an entire realm waking up nauseous and unable to function. \n\nUnfortunately, this is what has happened to our beloved Rósande. While our illustrious nobility was busy enjoying themselves, dancing and preening and drinking the vast wine cellars of the Crimson Palace dry, our orcish servants had the utter temerity, the absolute gall, to stage an uprising as soon as their rightful masters were out of sight. \n\nOf course this was doomed to failure, something those ungrateful greenskins would have known if they had even a fraction of the mental prowess of their betters, but the repercussions of this futile rebellion will be felt for many decades to come."

 rosande_trees_entangled_title:0 "Trees Entangled"
 rosande_trees_entangled_desc:0 "While we have defeated the orcish rebellion, the savages had one final trick to play on their betters – by forcing us to kill them, they have deprived us of their labor! If we are to truly restore the proper order of society, we must acquire more slaves to replace those who betrayed us. Fortuitously, an answer lies to our south: the Deepwoods. This vast forest contains a multitude of orcs, who entered that pristine land and despoiled it with their presence, just as they did with Escan during the Greentide. We have an interest – nay, a duty — to enter that land and tame its inhabitants, for the benefit of worthy folk everywhere."

 rosande_harsh_control_title:0 "Harsh Control"
 rosande_harsh_control_desc:0 "The uprising took us by surprise, but in hindsight, the warning signs were there. It is now apparent to us that due to misplaced compassion we were much too lenient to our slaves. This is a mistake we will not allow to occur ever again. Strict oversight is needed, because as the old saying goes ‘idle hands do the infernal’s work’, and we shall make very sure that our orc slaves learn their lesson and are kept too busy to entertain treasonous notions of another rebellion. \n\nAfter all, they have to make up for the needless loss of so many of their fellow slaves, whose numbers were culled during the failed uprising, and even more importantly, the damage inflicted on property and profits throughout the realm."

 rosande_unpaid_labour_title:0 "Unpaid Labour"
 rosande_unpaid_labour_desc:0 "The savages are more cunning than expected. They have attacked our columns without warning, freeing their brethren and retreating into the forest where our knights cannot follow. Such dishonourable conduct proves the righteousness of our cause, but still presents a practical issue. Thankfully, the orcs are not the only race in this woods, and have made enemies of the local elves. While many elves preposterously claim that we are just another foreign conqueror, some of them seem to recognize that we are natural allies. These sensible elves can serve as trackers, letting us enchain those who would threaten their home. This should simply be seen as repayment for our efforts in clearing out the greenskin filth, as we, unlike the orcs, do not work for free."

 rosande_wasted_potential_title:0 "Wasted Potential"
 rosande_wasted_potential_desc:0 "Another lesson taken from the slave rebellion is that while most orcs are only suited to hard physical labor, the rare few appear to possess some degree of innate magical talent. We will have to make sure that none of them abuse their talents the way Surga and her ilk did. Of course it is unthinkable to train them as proper mages, but with the proper obedience they might make useful assistants for our mages. \n\nAnd as for those who prove recalcitrant? There are other… uses they can be introduced to. A recent discovery from far Aelantir has reached us. The blood of magical creatures or beings with magical talent can be used as a substitute for damestear to empower arcane workings."

 rosande_half_breeds_title:0 "The Half-breeds"
 rosande_half_breeds_desc:0 "A somewhat unsavory issue has come to the forefront in the wake of the uprising. The question of the half-breeds - products of the illicit union between orcish slave and human master whose numbers increase with every passing year. While this topic is of course not something to be discussed in polite society, they exist nonetheless and we need to decide once and for all what their place in Rósande society shall be."

 rosande_those_who_escaped_title:0 "Those who Escaped"
 rosande_those_who_escaped_desc:0 "For the longest time the orcs marauding beneath the verdant canopy of the Deepwoods thought themselves beyond our reach. But this is no longer true, and finally they shall be made to pay for the crimes of their ancestors. \n\nThe power of the statelets they have formed deep in the forest has been broken, and we are now in a position to start the transfer of their people to those plantations, mines and mills in our heartlands suffering from a lack of laborers in the aftermath of the grand slave rebellion. \n\nWhile their ancestors might have escaped justice, their descendants will finally face the just consequences of the crimes committed by their people. Justice will at long last be served."

 rosande_city_of_flowers_title:0 "City of Flowers"
 rosande_city_of_flowers_desc:0 "On the shores of the glistening Silverainé rises a true marvel clad in rose-colored marble, emanating a gentle glow in the light of the sun, decorated with ornate gardens overflowing with roses of all imaginable colors and adorned with beautiful palaces full of sumptuous ornaments and gilded with gold and silver filigree. \n\nAs we envisioned long ago, Ionntrás has truly become a thriving city of wonders, worthy of our noble realm. While it has required the effort of many generations to create this marvel, those ambling along the avenues of the city of flowers will readily agree it was well worth it."

 rosande_crimson_crown_title:0 "The Crimson Crown"
 rosande_crimson_crown_desc:0 "If there is one true symbol of rightful rulership in our old home, it is the famed ruby crown of Lorent. Looking back, we see however the stagnation and corruption indelibly linked to this symbol of kingship. The crown was not even truly earned by Lorenan, but a gift from the ruby dwarves to elevate their favorite pet warlord and make him beholden to their designs for Lencenor. \n\nWe, however, have fought for our right to rule these lands, bringing justice, peace and prosperity to this desolate place. The royal crown of Rósande, the magnificent Crown of Crimson Gleam, will therefore be forged by our own hands, reshaping the empty remains of the crown of Castellyr and adorning it with a uniquely gleaming gemstone found deep in the heart of Ciranmyna. This will symbolize our indisputable right to rule over Escann and the Deepwoods as ordained by destiny."

 rosande_rise_above_flames_title:0 "Rise above the flames"
 rosande_rise_above_flames_desc:0 "The many fault lines within our realm which led to the tragic betrayal of the great orcish rebellions have been dealt with one by one, except for the most insidious. Some of our nobility have forgotten that while they might be ordained to rule over their lessers, this is not due to arbitrary divine providence but because they possess a suitably superior character, and with it a corresponding responsibility to take care of their charges. \n\nAbandoning all obligations and chasing only after ephemeral pleasures, they have made us all vulnerable to these slave revolts. But this will no longer be tolerated. We will ensure that only the most talented and disciplined amongst the ranks of our nobility will ascend to the highest ranks, and all those who fail in their duties will risk censure from the crown. The true blooming of our noble houses is about to begin."

 rosande_ashen_bloom_title:0 "The Ashen Bloom"
 rosande_ashen_bloom_desc:0 "The pale ashen rose of Rósande has grown her roots deep in the fertile soil of Escann, and shall never be extricated. We have stayed true to our noble purpose and brought the light of civilization to these tormented lands, bringing the savages dwelling in the ruins of their victims to justice, and enabled an unprecedented flourishing of our domain. \n\nAll over Cannor our wealth is envied, our wines are praised, and our claim to be the true successors of chivalric Escann is respected. But as they say, the true rewards are the slaves we made along the way. \n\nSuch innate excellence as we have demonstrated is of course rewarded only by the imposition of even more duties, as it shall be our destiny going forward to bring proper order to the remainder of the former Castanorian domain and beyond."

 flavor_rosande.2.t:0 "Looking to Bright Futures"
 flavor_rosande.2.d:0 "Every knight that boasts of their noble heritage dares not name their lineage, as within every suit of shining armor dwells darkness. Few understood the righteous justice of the crimson knight; it was felt appropriate to decry the methods of the Order of the Ashen Rose. Despite their service during the Lilac Wars, their members remain in exile, banished from Lencenor and its nobility. \n\nAlthough all within the Order of the Ashen Rose come from disgraced pasts, within Escann none know of imperial politics nor ruined nobility; they knew only of the crimson knights' valiant exploits against the orcs, that they were harbingers of justice for all the evils committed during the Greentide. For once, the people they serve dwell not on all the villages they have burned, but celebrate all the orcs they have felled. Finally, their crimson armor is a sign of hope rather than a reminder of atrocity. \n\nFar from the imperial core, far from the monotonous politics, in a grateful land rests a chance. A chance to not only reclaim their noble prestige but also go beyond it; Without the shackles of imperial politics and traditions, without the maddening laws of peerage which had left their family titles unchanged for generations. A chance to build a brighter future on their own accord."

 flavor_rosande.3.t:0 "A Noble Slaver"
 flavor_rosande.3.d:0 "As the sun rises a noble dines upon the finest olives, figs, cheese, and sausage - washing it all down with centuries-old wine recently recovered from the ruins of Castonath. Yet even before the songbirds have their chance to chirp, the crackle of distant whips and rattling of chains drowns out what little remains of the morning calm. \n\nDozens of orcs toil in the vineyards, their lumbering bodies ill-fit for the exhausting work. Their green bodies are covered in hundreds of deep lime-colored scars, accumulated not from years of servitude but mere months. All the while their bodies wither away from gnawing hunger, until the shackles which bound them come loose. Yet there is no time for the orcs to lament their condition, as any perceived idleness invites the wrath of the slave drivers whip; even this is merciful in comparison to the barbed whip, which tears off chunks of flesh with terrifying ease, used to punish the insubordinate. \n\nThe noble realizes the wine’s taste has fouled, and pours out the rest of the wine onto the rouge colored patch on the walnut hardwood floor. It is beneath him to drink leftovers; after all, that is the privilege of slaves."

 flavor_rosande.4.d:0 "Within a mansion, atop a bulwari carpet and beneath crystal chandeliers, a circle of couches lay around a table. Atop these in turn were reclining nobles, each clad in dresses or suits of red, adorned by gold tassels that only highlighted the quality of the fabric. Around them, liveried servants rushed to and fro with plates and wine glasses. \n\n‘Truly, there is notgreater good than indulgence.’ remarked a fat and contented noble. ‘You could never do something like this back West. The priests would babble some nonsense about restraint or somesuch.’ Another noble looked up from his empty glass, a conniving gleam in his eye. ‘There are some who indulge even more than we. Whose favored live lives of unfettered indulgence rather than moralistic prattling. \n\n ‘You're talking about the archdevils,’ whispered the fat noble.\n\n‘I am. Iberral has granted me an endless appetite and bounty, and I have never been happier. He is a generous master, I am sure he would accept you all.’ The second noble glanced invitingly at his fellows, before a third noble, covered in scars from years of war, spoke up. \n\n‘You would prove all those who call us faithless oathbreakers right? We came to civilize this land, to prove we were better than those soft-hearted lackeys of the Ruby Crown, and now you wish to throw that all away?’ The glutton scoffed. ‘So you would have us deny our true potential because those soft-hearted lackeys adhere to some silly superstitions? Next you’ll be prattling about how I shall suffer in Hell instead of eternally feasting at my master’s table.’ The other nobles looked between the knight and the glutton, slowly making up their minds, while the servants began to whisper in the corner."

It was these guests of honor who had to be courted to end the orcish slave trade to Aelantir, to free up slaves to work in local vineyards. \n\nThe night grew old and wine continued to flow freely; wine merchants continued to cozy up to the representatives, espousing the economic benefits of shifting their trade from slaves to Rósandan wine. Yet every time the Vertesk and Nathalaire representatives had their wine topped up, their expressions grew more bitter. Eventually they refused to drink Rosande wine altogether, complaining that the wine was suited only for peasants and servants. \n\nThe wine merchants kept up the ruse of politeness, hoping to persuade the representatives another way. The organizer of the ball, however, claiming his honor had been sullied, challenged the representatives to a duel. Blow after blow, one broken bone after another, the representatives were beaten to a pulp until their once handsome faces were rendered unrecognizable."

Yet what was once an afterthought has become his newest headache, as his vineyard expansion is now critically constrained by the shortage of slaves on the local market, while the wine market as a whole has remained stagnant. \n\nHis mind begins to churn and his thoughts grow bitter; while Rósande clamors for laborers, orc slaves are continuously exported to Aelantir. Yet Aelantir was not savaged by the orcs during the Greentide, Escann was. Would it not serve Escann better to retain orc slaves to build local industries? If the wine industry was constrained by labor shortages, other industries were sure to be suffering too… The slavers had to be stopped. Their continuous plundering of Escann’s resources was actively sabotaging Rosande’s prosperity and future. Perhaps if the foreign slave traders could be convinced to sell Rósanda wine instead of orc slaves, a mutually beneficial trade could be established."

Despite the headstrong Old Guard, however, the king continued to negotiate with the higher nobles of Marrhold, as a steady and reliable source of iron was critical for Rósande’s future. Weeks of intense negotiations eventually ended with the Marrodics receiving some local autonomy and a sizable workforce of slaves; in return, any Marrodic land containing iron ore would solely be used to extract and refine said iron. \n\nBoth lances struck true, but the Marrodic lance shattered shortly after and the knight was stunned off his horse. The Rósandan crowd cheered, but the knight instead chose to circle around and help the Marrodic knight back to their feet.

They received the finest possible education, and most importantly were graced with the human name ‘Hawthorne’. \n\nDespite being born of the union of two worlds, neither side accepted them. Orcs lamented the half-orcs' freedom as unbecoming of a true orc, while humans could not see beyond the surface of their light-green skin. Eventually Hawthorne was released from the plantation, as many half-orcs were; the owner, unsure of half-orc’s legal status, didn’t know what to do with them. \n\nHawthorne would roam human society for years, jumping between jobs and housing, unable to settle down as no community would take them; aimlessly wandering until their funds ran out.

It was hard work, but it was fulfilling - she got to see the smiles of happy children every day. When her shop closed, she would spend her free time reading up on the history of Escann, from the War of the Sorcerer King to the end of the Greentide. It was a peaceful life. That was, until the men in Crimson Armor laid siege to the Stone City. She did not remember much of that night, other than screams, flames, and the sword hilt of the knight that knocked her out to be taken away. \n\nOnly orcs were chained up, while the human residents of the city were left to fend for themselves. While the orcs trod the roads, walking barefoot until the blisters that formed caused them agonizing pain, treasure looted from Castonath was loaded on wagons headed south to Ionntrás. Within the next week, fewer and fewer familiar faces remained, as neighbors, friends, and colleagues were sold off at the slave markets. Eventually, Khaara herself was sold off, and found herself working in the grand vineyard of a Rósanda slave owner. \n\nWeeks passed in a blink as she remained in a mental haze.

Some nobles ran towards the exits, trying to evade the evil magics doubtless at work. Others retched up their meals, convinced that poison must have been the cause. Still more drew their swords and advanced upon  their orcish servants, certain that one or the other must be the cause of the tragedy. \n\nAfter a few moments, a noble named Aline sìl Leigalen took the stage. \n\n‘Friends!

Then the call spread further. \n\nNow the greatest mercenary class in the continent has thrown away its future in this pointless war, despite all our attempts at mercy. Half orcs who have fought in dozens of mercenary campaigns come home with stolen steel for the mongrel horde; even foreign half-orcs, whose orcish relatives never felt the righteous justice delivered by the lash, march into our lands. They declare it “free”, suckered into a fool’s game by their mercenary comrades. \n\nAs seemingly every poor fool with a drop of Orcish blood marches on us, we remember some essential truths.

With a frame and height surpassing that of the average orc, Kylian síl Rósande is an anomaly among both humanity and the nobility. Unlike the wretched beasts called orcs and despite his size, Kylian síl Rósande - with his chiseled face, luscious golden hair and sapphire-blue eyes - is unmistakably human. \n\nThe delicate marble tile flooring cracks as Kylian síl Rósande walks down the hallway, past adoring nobility and servants starstruck by his magnificence. Yet despite having returned from his magical studies to serve his country at its time of need, he brings with him a meager retinue of 17 concubines, 5 orc slaves, and 11 homunculi. Indeed his humility is widely known and praised, as everybody knows Kylian síl Rósande does not brag, preferring instead to demonstrate his magical prowess on his orcish slaves. On many occasions he has incinerated or vaporized orcs from his retinue, indulging the request of lowly peasants wishing to see magic for the first time. \n\nHe arrives in the throne room and sits upon two of his orcish slaves, as the nobles bicker around him for the privilege of crowning their new king. The discussion continues for minutes and the orcs beneath Kylian síl Rósande begin to tremble. \n\n‘As no one is worthy of crowning me, I shall crown myself.’ Kylian síl Rósande walks up to the throne and conducts an impromptu coronation, much to the pleasant surprise of the onlookers."

Instead of a grand palace room, they stood in an (albeit luxurious) tent at the front. Instead of a council of great lords only barely controlled by their monarch, it consisted of King Kylian laying out his plan, expecting it to be obeyed by his commanders, nobles with proven military talent. \n\nHis plan to end the rebellion was also different. Instead of spreading out trying to protect isolated plantations, they would meet the whole Orcish force at once. They would not attack immediately, but instead draw them into the open where cavalry could be most effective. Most important, however, was the desire to kill. \n\nIn the early stages of the rebellion, many nobles thought that their slaves could eventually be recaptured and thus refrained from killing them. Kylian, in contrast, knew that victory only comes from death, and instructed his forces to have no mercy upon the Orcs. \n\nAs the council ended, all who attended were relieved. For the first time, the rebellion would be fought with vigour."

Slave - a title by which she refused to let anyone call her ever again; a title which demeaned everything she and her comrades had fought for; a word she had promised no Escanni orc would ever again hear. \n\nKylian síl Rósande doesn’t move an inch. He remains sitting on his orcish slaves, conjuring magical attacks while his eleven homunculus guards hold Surga at bay. Surga conjures hundreds of lightning strikes in minutes, a spectacular feat of magic, hoping to overwhelm Kylian’s defences, but the homunculi absorb them all. As she fights,she dodges constant magical attacks from Kylian síl Rósande. \n\nNever does Kylian síl Rósande conjure a defensive spell, remaining on the offensive as the homunculi begin to crumble, dismantled one by one until only four remain. With most of Kylian’s guard gone, Surga finally manages to land a hit; her bolt melts a streak of crimson paint from his armor, armor never before blemished. Just as Kylian begins to falter, just as Surga thinks victory is possible, an orc approaches from behind. He stabs Surga through the torso; his eyes are awash with agony as he pins Surga down long enough for the Homunculi to impale each one of her limbs. \n\nKylian síl Rósande walks up to Surga, now on her knees. He looks at the orc slave, now collapsed on the grass. ‘Good job Shurkul, you will get extra food for the next month.’ He reaches for his hilt, caressing the ruby pommel, but upon seeing the anger on Surga’s face lets go of it. \n\n‘I will not foul my blade with the blood of a bea- No. Even beasts don’t deserve to be compared to orcs… I will not foul my blade with the blood of an orc.’ \n\n‘My name is Surga.’ Another homunculus drives a spear through Surga’s torso, but despite the pain she lifts her head, almost clambering to her feet. ‘You may kill me, but you will never kill what I represent. You will never kill our desire for freedom, you will never kill our hope.’ \n\n‘Slave…’ Kylian síl Rósande eyes lock with Surga’s; his words are binding. She is no longer the master of her own body. He grabs a rusty goblin blade from one of his homunculi and throws it to the ensorcelled Surga. ‘Kill yourself.’"

Whenever the realm  has need for a large amount of laborers, they must be temporarily requisitioned via the system of royal corvée until the work is done and they can return to the demesne of their masters.

Whatever reinforcements the slave pens can produce is not enough to replenish the losses incurred due to accidents, exhaustion, disciplinary action and disease.

Theirs was not the only cart in the convoy; five other carts had joined them on their journey to their uncertain future. The day had been long and Surga was thirsty, hoping against the odds that their new owners remembered to give them some water while they waited for the river ferry. Their destination lay on the other river side, and the ferry was the only way for miles to get the carts across. \n\nSuddenly a commotion broke out, the slavers frantically waving to a flat-hulled ferry just returning from the opposite shore of the river. Turning her head, she saw a dust cloud approaching their convoy. Soon the sound of galloping horses could be heard and the mercenaries hired by the slavers had assumed a defensive position. A patrol of knights charged into the ranks of the mercenaries, and soon a desperate struggle ensued. Her cart was rolling onto the deck of the ferry as the last mercenary fell to the blow of a saber. The slavers rushed for cover on-deck, abandoning the remaining carts. The knights rushed towards the ferry; just as it cast off, Surga’s arm was grabbed. She watched as the chain linking her to the cart and her parents’ was cleaved with a decisive stroke. Futilely reaching for her parents, a desperate Surga could do nothing but slowly watch them disappear, carried on the boat into the river fog. \n\nIt was the last time she would ever see them, but her mother’s cries still echoed in her mind. For years after, she  dreamed up scenarios in her mind: ‘What if the cart got onto the ferry just a bit faster?’, ‘what if the knights were fast enough to catch her parents cart?’. On and on in circles she trod, but with each day resignation gnawed at the fringes of her hopes. Eventually, only the weary acceptance that she would never again see her parents was left."

Disgruntled, the noble audibly cursed the crown for causing all of his struggles, grabbing his whip and leaving the empty dining-table in his wake.

His estate felt desolate, and it gnawed at him as much as the wine's acrid aftertaste. \n\nHe savored the final bite of cheese, unwilling to waste even a crumb. The rations for his dwindling workforce had to be carefully managed; after all, the scarcity of the orcs meant that they needed much strength to perform their duties. As he leaned back in his chair, his thoughts turned bitter. Though the current state of affairs might have been worse, he silently cursed his liege for the empty slave auctions."

While the strongest had gone to wealthier families, he was content with the ones he had nabbed. While they weren’t exactly used to the hard toil expected of their kind just yet, he was sure that a few cracks of the whip would get them into shape soon enough. His plantation, though still far from its greatest potential, was a source of quiet pride. He turned from the balcony and made his way to the dining table, laden with the remnants of a hearty feast."

Perhaps he would be generous and let them off a little early today. \n\nThe scent of delicious foods filled the room as he looked to his table, crowded with the finest of nourishments you could find throughout Cannor.
