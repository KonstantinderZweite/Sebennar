 tuathak_copper_mines_title:0 "Copper Monopoly"
 tuathak_copper_mines_desc:0 "Eordand is a land replete with riches, but for all it has it lacks the most important of all: ample supplies of iron, copper, and other important metals. While there is a lack of domestic iron, the sources of copper in Eordand are firmly held by our Tuathak brethren: it has made our legions strong and our pockets heavy. The lords of Sglard have even named themselves Copperheart, doubtless after their hold on the copper supply. However, the current production is not quite enough to meet our needs: let us secure control of one of the mines, and invest into our future."

 tuathak_prepare_praisegranting_festival_desc:0 "We have known that there are lands beyond our shores, mostly sparsely inhabited by primitive beings not blessed by our Fey Lords. The Caamasi also tell us of merchants from far to the south. What has arrived this day is not an ordinary occurrence: a massive wooden ship bedecked in gleaming iron guns sailed into our harbor, making inquiries about our lands and our peoples. Doubtless impressed by our might, they wish to stay in our lands for some time. This occasion warrants a reaction: let us prepare for a Praisegranting!"
 tuathak_host_the_festival_title:0 "Host the Praisegranting Festival"
 tuathak_host_the_festival_desc:0 "The Praisegranting is a festival dedicated to giving praise to those deserving of honor, with tribute given to those mighty and valorous. Our visitors from across the sea have taken interest in this festival: let us invite them to it! Let us make sure that we have allies in case something goes wrong..."
 tuathak_iadth_transgressors_title:0 "Iadth Transgressors"
 tuathak_iadth_transgressors_desc:0 "A glowering mar on our reputation, and an attack on all of the Autumn Court, the former realm of Dorcurt was seized by a Peitar invasion from the Domandrod. This vile imposter, calling itself Iadth, tore apart the former Autumn Court in the name of 'balance' of the seasons. For too long they have squatted on our autumnal lands: vengeance must be delivered, we must drive the Iadth imposters back to the Domandrod!"
 tuathak_unite_the_northmarch_title:0 "Unite the Northmarch"
 tuathak_unite_the_northmarch_desc:0 "The ancestral homeland of the Tuathak, the Northmarch guards the rest of Eordand from the despicable Snecboth idolatrists. Now that the Iadth defilers have been dealt with, our home has been made secure from all but our wavering kinsfolk. Our peoples still disunited, our lands still vulnerable to the sneaky Peitar, the haughty Selphereg, and the savage Snecboth. The Tuathak will weather these tumultuous times as we have always triumphed over the long winter!"
 tuathak_march_into_spring_title:0 "March into Spring"
 tuathak_march_into_spring_desc:0 "Autumn has secured its sovereignty against the coming cold, but another force lurks that threatens our peace: the Selphereg of the Spring Court. The ancient borders of our people, Tasmet of the first change in autumn leaves, was stolen from the Tuathak by the opportunistic Arakepruni vernals. We must ensure not only that our lands are restored to our rule, but that the unnatural magics of the Spring cannot threaten us anymore: Arakeprun and its Spring Court must be shown its rightful place under our watch!"
 tuathak_rally_the_guard_title:0 "Rally the Phalanx"
 tuathak_rally_the_guard_desc:0 "These are times of crises uncounted: our Autumn Court in Dorcurt razed by the Peitar, the endless advance of the Snecboth and the hated winter on our lands, and more threaten the preservation of our Autumn. The legions must be assembled if we are to withstand the change of seasons in these dark times and return to the sanctity of Autumn."
 tuathak_golden_acres_title:0 "Golden Acres"
 tuathak_golden_acres_desc:0 "Blessed by Autumn, our lands are by far the most beautiful of all Eordand. Shimmering glades of yellow, orange, and red, our forests are likened to that of lavish sculptures wrought of Gold, Copper and Rubies. This beauty is marred by the scorches of warfare and the defilement of invaders; by necessity we must protect our forests and lands. If we can prove that we are worthy of Autumn's grace, our cause will inspire warriors domestic and foreign to join our cause to defend our Golden Acres. What is more beautiful than the sight of our wonderful Autumn trees secure with the faint ringing of practiced swordplay?"
 tuathak_aftermath_of_the_randrunnse_conquest_title:0 "Aftermath of the Randrunnse Conquest"
 tuathak_aftermath_of_the_randrunnse_conquest_desc:0 "Beyond our ancestral lands is a most cursed and frozen land inhabited by those who ignorantly worship the forces of their own destruction. Far worse than that, the Snecboth dare to bring and intensify the winter against us, invading our lands hoping to seize them for themselves! It is good that those days have ended, for our warriors were proven superior: the lands of Eighard, Jhorgashirr, Slegcal were thawed of their wintry grasp by the warmth of Autumn. We must remain vigilant: the threat of their wintry idolatry remain deadly. Our strongholds in our claimed lands must be secured against any icy incursion."
 tuathak_resume_the_hibernal_crusade_title:0 "Resume the Hibernal Crusade"
 tuathak_resume_the_hibernal_crusade_desc:0 "Now that our holds in the north are secured, we must not rest and wait for them: we must strike at the heart of Winter and end this madness!"
 tuathak_tame_the_savage_north_title:0 "Tame the Savage North"
 tuathak_tame_the_savage_north_desc:0 "If we are to end the hated Winter once and for all, we must ensure that the Snecboth will no bolster its destructive forces. Their lands must be seized, for we must be vigilant and ensure that their vile practices end here!"
 tuathak_lone_north_title:0 "Lone North"
 tuathak_lone_north_desc:0 "We cannot falter in our duty to end the Winter: all of Randrunnse must be secured. We fight so that no longer will we have to struggle to survive while those southerners bask in their bountiful warmth. The Tuathak will thrive with our victory!"
 tuathak_end_winters_tyranny_title:0 "End Winter's Tyranny"
 tuathak_end_winters_tyranny_desc:0 "The Snecboth, our hated enemy, has been defeated. We cannot forget or forgive their actions, causing unaccountable death and misery across all Eordand with their Wintry zealotry. If we are to end the Winter we must strike at its source: our enemy must be defeated forevermore."
 tuathak_redeem_the_snecboth_title:0 "Redeem the Snecboth"
 tuathak_redeem_the_snecboth_desc:0 "The Snecboth, our hated enemy, has been defeated. While we cannot forget their actions, we can hope to forgive them in due time. Under our vigilance we can end their misguided worship of Winter, and we can guide them to reform their ways. All may see the wisdom and truth of Autumn, and after all what is Autumn without its chills?"

 tuathak_pretenders_of_pelomar_desc:0 "To the south are the pathetic impostures, the so-called Champions of the Fey. For too long Pelomar has exploited its long defunct title, it is time that they are put down and replaced by those truly worthy."
