 dakinshi_events.1.t:0 "The Warlord Era"
 dakinshi_events.1.d.1:0 "The folk remember the old Bwa Dakinshi as a place with rivers of gold and bronze flowing between its many cities. Among them, Kaziradoka was its crown jewel, hosting the only mint in the empire and the most bustling markets that handled every metal brought downstream from rich and plentiful mines placed in the mountains.\n\nMany of these cities lay ruined now, yet the greatest city of the old empire did not share their fate. Led first by the only continuous dynasty apart from the wretched Cobras, the Imanzi family kept the city safe and influential, drawing close to unifying the region on multiple occasions.\nYet, even recently the ambitions of the family fell short, as Vitarogomo Mlima was killed in the defense of Inshibonde.\n\nIn her absence, the city’s neighbours became formidable, between a one-shifter army, a powerful bandit lord and a warlock who sold her soul to Hags. This time, the prowess of Bakatwa Destroyers may not be enough for the city to survive. \nThat said, for many the greatest reason to fear lies in Mwasagore. While her innate passion to study the past proved helpful in managing the city, many doubt whether she is capable of defending the city as a warrior. Even if they are right, that does not prove that everything is yet lost. The years of studying her ancestors' failures provide her with an unique advantage, one that many will underestimate for their own peril."
 dakinshi_events.1.d.2:0 "The warlord period saw many people rise and fall. Stories of people torn away from their families either by slavery or forced to enlist to avoid poverty, forced to fight for the cause of whichever foolishly ambitious Vitaragomo they served under.\n\nYet, little could experience the degree of success that Kwizera had, both in her gifts and in execution of her plans. Explosive both in temperament and in the fields of battle, she used her one in a million combination of magical, martial and shapeshifting prowess to quickly rise up in Death Bringing Cobra’s hierarchy, standing as one of the most influential Munitarogomo in the clan despite being barely 19 at the time.\n\nAs her death toll rose to thousands in the siege of Inshibonde, so did her following. Most knew that the clan’s success was mostly due to her abilities and so they were ready to turn their backs on them the instant she did. When it became apparent that Kuvunika would last way longer than anticipated, she did exactly that. A slaughter at their own house, personally leading a platoon set to cull the entirety of Death Bringing Cobra to forge her own domain, ruled by her own iron fist, to match her own ambitions."
 dakinshi_events.1.d.3:0 "Akaliza is one of the little Vitarogomo whose fame was not earned through fear-striking acts of violence. She began as an adventurer, helping common people when the warbands did nothing but take their taxes or pillage their livelihoods completely. She thrived, living in the moment, exorcising curses, culling off the local monsters and earning hefty sums from Antmvuran or Leopard Lodge traders. \n\nThat was four years ago at this point. Before she took her sister’s life as a last bounty, taking over Degumwamba and later proving her worth to the mentor of her family - the magic talking frog Rufaro. \nUsing favors she accumulated in her travels, she secured a seemingly nice headstart. But she was stubborn and that almost cost her everything. Surrounded by the Mengi and Dakinshi, she had to make a miracle happen twice, killing both the King of Lipmekat and the Vitarogomo of Eusiwuni in hand-to-hand combat, before a real battle could happen. One that she would’ve lost, as her comparably harsh standards attracted little people to her ranks.\n\nIt was a harsh lesson that forced her to change. She made concessions that attracted the people she never wanted to stand down to. If she wanted to win, she needed to play by everyone’s rules, even if it pained her to do so. Yet, she still needs to maintain Rufaro’s backing, not only because losing that would damn her reputation, but also because the help of his druids was irreplaceable to her plans."
 dakinshi_events.1.d.4:0 "Nestled in the steep mountain slopes of the Pakreda Sedara Mountains lies the territory ruled by the Death Bringing Cobra clan. These are the final remaining territories ruled by the ancient dynasty that once held dominion over all of Bamaliwuni and beyond. Yet, those days are long gone, as ever since the royal family abandoned the capital 200 years ago, the Death Bringing Cobra clan has declined in relevance.\n\nBut a decade ago, it seemed the clan would have a reversal in fortunes. The armies of the Death Bringing Cobra clan descended from the mountains, captured the fortress city of Inshibonde, and even laid siege to the stronghold of Kuvunika. Unfortunately, in 1439 a high-ranking retainer named Kwizera betrayed the clan’s leadership when they were most vulnerable, and forced the remnants to flee back into the mountains from which they came.\n\nIn the chaos and confusion, another high ranking retainer of the clan, Kuende, became the new matriarch, and the guardian of the last legitimate heir, who was but merely a baby during the usurpation of Kwizera. But one night, Kuende was visited by a shadow that promised her the power to restore the old order in the name of Hags. She agreed to this pact and now it is this dark power, along with the unbroken loyalty of those that still serve the Death Bringing Cobra clan, that has allowed the legitimate rulers of Bwa Dakinshi to survive even this catastrophic setback. However, it remains an open question if the ancient clan will be able to return to their rightful place as the true rulers of Bwa Dakinshi, especially with Kuende isolating her heir from everyone..."
 dakinshi_events.1.d.5:0 "While she always wanted to become the Vitarogomo of the North, the way that was brought onto Kagoma wasn’t one that she planned for. Her predecessor’s death was supposed to come through her flaming blade. Yet, that moment never came, her body buried three years ago as she lost the duel against the famous Akaliza. Kagoma slept at that time, cast aside during the siege, intentionally sidelined even if her presence would’ve drastically changed the outcome in favor of Eusiwuni.\n\nWarlords of the North, humiliated and forced to concede in favor of a new power. Minor warlords fighting for the scraps. One clear favourite to win it all. Soon, her people treated her as a god, their radical reverence of shapeshifters fueled to her benefit. If anyone wanted to raise a hand at her, she would burn them alive. Thus, she forced everyone to pray to her burning likeness. She brought the Kaziran Leopard Lodge to the country to monopolise the trade for herself and then isolated every shifter around her court, away from their minor warbands. No one protested. That finally proved she and only she was in charge of Eusiwuni’s new future.\n\nYet, there was one last thing to make straight. Akaliza, the one who stole her score on the kill she wanted the most, was still alive and well in the place that stripped Eusiwuni of the prestige and territory it had, an annoying thorn that was to be disposed of and razed to the ground as a statement to everyone, even the south. And it says:"
 dakinshi_events.1.d.6:0 "“It was two years ago. My band stood upon the walled city, hurling boulders with the makeshift trebuchets created by my druid guys. We smashed the enemy’s army a long time ago at this point and the siege was going long, as we had no way of blocking the ships coming from the sea. (We tried. Turns out trebuchets are only good when aiming at big blocks.)\n\nAt this point, I started to think it was a miracle that no one backstabbed me yet, but my buddies told me everything will be fine, if I just do what I do best. So I organised my trusted fellas at night to do it the good, old stealthy way. On our way I even saw some of buddies' cloaky guys doing the same thing, so we exchanged some signs and they seemt very happy with what we were doing. \nEither way we swam the long way, going for the docks. There were maybe three guys on the surface and they were completely clueless. So we killed them. Now it was time to go big or go home as I say. We gave the front gate guard a charge from behind, then I pulled the gates open and made a solid toot so the band knew that it was time to pluuuuunder that coffee-sniffer coffer. \n\nWe cleared the gate, honestly I thought there was more of ‘em there. The gang poured in, I told the lessers whose region was whose and we started lootin’. Everybody was happy and so I was happy. And that’s sorta how Fuhoengwaan fell. \n\nKinda sad that Cheni died tho, she was a good fella."\n\nGahigi Mushubi, "I Was a Warlord Once""
 dakinshi_events.1.d.7:0 ""What do you mean you DIDN’T?!" Mrs. Mou screamed at the soldier. "Do you imagine how important they are to the league?! Who will be there to translate for us?" She continued to bash him and well, she was right. There were no translators without the Cin family and they weren’t the only ones that were going to be absent at the families’s meeting. Actions needed to be made now, if they were to be saved.\n\nThe meeting was begun by the Umulisa family, the only one whose headmarriage were fluent in Yan and Dakinshi at the moment. The topic of today’s meeting was the dismission of the chairmistress Ai Yi, who was nowhere to be found after a lost battle against Gumti warlords and choosing a new one in her stead. As coffee was poured into Pinghoi “imported” porcelain cups, each family started discussing already preselected candidates.\n\nAs the last cup was finished, the beans were cast. 13 out of 14 votes on Ka Gunam Zong. 1 abstained from the Baashidi representative, who frankly couldn’t understand a word. It was a rare occurrence for the families to be united like this, but the humiliation that was the loss of Fuhoengwaan justified the action. And so, the scribes were told to make two notes. One to congratulate the new chairmistress on her nomination..."
 dakinshi_events.1.d.8:0 ""The pacification of dissidents is going well, Vitaragomo. The offshoots of the defeated nobility tried sparking unrest in the buffer Tanizu tribes, but we managed to successfully locate and eliminate them. \nFurthermore, the tribes enjoy their new freedom of acting, preferring to stay under your mantle. From the recent counting, you can expect around 1000 Tanizu joining the ranks for our new campaign, including 170 shifters, though it will be your choice whether you are going to accept the more taboo ones coming with me.\n\nFurthermore, it seems like new confederations are forming on the territories we retreated from after we took over reins of the state. Their threat is yet to be assumed, but knowing that damn witch that massacred us, they will soon start making their moves.\n\nAs my job has been done here, I will be coming back to my station at Kuvunika. Hopefully by that time, more willing warriors will be found to secure the eastern flank once and for all. For the Lizard Warlord!\n\nReporting from Kuraru,\nMunitagoromo Garuka Kagomuneba""
 dakinshi_events.1.d.9:0 "Two centuries ago Bwa Dakinshi descended into anarchy, the empire collapsing as the ruling clan was ousted and various warlords vied for supremacy. Our great empire is naught but history, our cities empty grave-markers, and our people suffering and enslaved by foreign raiders.\n\nEvery claimant to the title of Bwa Dakinshi must defeat their rivals in order to bring an end to this era of calamity and suffering."
