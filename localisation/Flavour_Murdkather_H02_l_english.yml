 murdkather_elarbarc_tensions_desc:0 "Elarbarc, named after the famous mariner Ealar, is known for it bustling shipbuilding industry, trade, and floating festivals upon the water. However, this tranquility is more often broken than intact in recent years, for the pretentious lords of Dearktir have threatened our trade and people. Situated on the island of Billel, the Dearktirans harass our merchants with fines and tariffs entering and leaving Murdkather harbor, supposedly entering their sovereign waters. It is our duty to protect our citizens and their livelihoods: Dearktir's harassment will end with our seizure of the island!"

 murdkather_autumn_passage_desc:0 "North of Murdkather, past a short span of woods before the Domandrod, is a narrow passage of habitable lands bordering the Egasach claimed by the Trimgarb Peitar tribe. They threaten us and insult as heretics, claiming that they have a righteous quest to end our veneration of the Summer. Besides, their lands connect the Randrunnse to the Elarbarc and Sarmadfar. Let us both end their threats against our faith, livelihoods, and increase our profits from control of the trade!"

 murdkather_summer_shipyards_desc:0 "Since the days of Ealar the Mariner, Murdkather has been a bustling center of shipbuilding. Fed by timber from the Domandrod borderlands of Snodglac and Galarig, our ships are highly prized throughout Eordand. In the late 15th and early 16th century efforts were made to improve and expand the shipbuilding industry by prioritizing prime timber logging and repairing ancient Precursor drydocks in Murdkather harbor."
 murdkather_randrunnse_ports_title:0 "Randrunnse Ports"
 murdkather_randrunnse_ports_desc:0 "Trade from all of Eordand makes its way to the Sarmadfar, but we should not ignore the sources of these many riches. The Randrunnse, a large sea not unlike the Sarmadfar but for its cold winters, is a nexus for trade for the Winter Court and the Autumn invaders in the north. With our access to the north secured by pacifying the Trimgarb, the Randrunnse trading cities of Jhorgashirr and Slegcal just within our reach. Murdkather must enlighten and enrich these frigid lands with the warmth of the Summer!"
 murdkather_snecboth_fur_trade_title:0 "Snecboth Fur Trade"
 murdkather_snecboth_fur_trade_desc:0 "The ports of the Randrunnse are filled with timber, tar, fish, and most importantly, plentiful furs. Although there are some Precursor Relics to be found, the fur trade from the boundless forests of the north are far richer. However, their fur trappers seem to be somewhat... unambitious. The Snecboth must be taught proper mercantile practices, for their own benefit of course."
