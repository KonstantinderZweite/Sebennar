 g_eliminating_the_old_clans_title:0 "Eliminate the Old Clans"
 g_eliminating_the_old_clans_desc:0 "Ves Udzenklan is the clan to end all clans. And so it shall. The old clan identities must be destroyed so that a new Allclan can be born. All parts of the old clans must be gone, including their claims to land."
 g_synthesizing_contraption_knowledge_title:0 "Contraption Synthesis"
 g_synthesizing_contraption_knowledge_desc:0 "The state of artifice in the Allclan is chaotic and fragmented. The goblin artificers all come from disparate educational backgrounds and artificer traditions. Artificers work from small workshops, competing and stealing from each other.\n\nChaos is good for innovation, but fragmentation is not. Collaboration and reverse engineering is complicated by the use of different technical standards and mathematical symbols. Standardizing the language of artifice within the Allclan should reward clever artificers able to swindle diagrams or examples of work."
 g_excellence_in_invention_title:0 "Excellence in Invention"
 g_excellence_in_invention_desc:0 "According to a recent study by Bomb Maker Quarterly, the artificery of the Cave Goblins is the best in the world. This only confirms what everyone from Er-Natvir to Amldhir already knew, that Ves Udzenklan is a driver of progress for all goblinkind! We are truly the greatest of races when it comes to invention, so it is only fitting that a government made by us is so capable of producing such excellence."
 
 g_breaking_the_longest_stalagtites_title:0 "The Longest Stalactites"
 g_breaking_the_longest_stalagtites_desc:0 "There are those who hold power but do not fit the vision and promise of Ves Udzenklan. They must be broken, chopped down, poisoned, bombed, incinerated, stabbed, decapitated, buried alive, and shot. Preferably not all at once."
 g_a_new_form_of_government_title:0 "A New Form of Government"
 g_a_new_form_of_government_desc:0 "Previous primitive governments have relied on rule by one or more or oligarchs elected by other oligarchs or maybe being the child of a previous oligarch. We have determined that multiple oligarchs elected by multiple other oligarchs is the best. But we can do better. As the most advanced people of the world, we must have the most advanced government. So what if every family was an oligarch?"
 g_consolidating_the_councils_rule_title:0 "The Council's Rule"
 g_consolidating_the_councils_rule_desc:0 "The Nezkaru council is perfect form of governance. Conceived by the greatest geniuses to ever live and brought into existence by these very same geniuses! Unfortunately there still exist counter-progressives within the Allclan who work to weaken the power of the council. Bribery, assassination, blackmail, or whatever else becomes necessary. It will all be used to ensure such troublemakers do not make trouble for the council."
 g_forward_goblinkind_title:0 "Forward, Goblinkind!"
 g_forward_goblinkind_desc:0 "Forward goblinkind!\n\nThese words define Ves Udzenklan. They define the nature of our society. The nature of our values. They describe the very essence of our chosen form of governance.\n\nForward! Into the future! Progress at all costs! FORWARD GOBLINKIND!"
 
 g_proofs_of_concept_title:0 "Proofs of Concept"
 g_proofs_of_concept_desc:0 "Ves Udzenklan promises far more than a powerful goblin state. With the proper guidance, it can become the instrument through which a new age is thrust upon goblinkind. Proving this is a simple matter.\n\nIf the Allclan can solve the problem of food supply efficaciously while hampered by old rules of governance and imbecilic fools, then it will become clear to even the most simple goblin what it can accomplish with the proper leadership."
 g_exploiting_the_fungus_boom_title:0 "Exploit the Fungus Boom"
 g_exploiting_the_fungus_boom_desc:0 "Food! Food! Food! Bountiful plentiful food. There's money to be made here and bellies to be filled. Fill the cookbooks with fungus recipes, because its whats for dinner."
 g_charting_the_new_markets_title:0 "Chart New Markets"
 g_charting_the_new_markets_desc:0 "It turns out that fungus production has gone beyond even the wildest dreams of the fungus producing cartels. Traditional markets for this delicious food are simply no longer adequate. Let it never be said a goblin wasted an opportunity to sell something to someone."
 
 g_the_place_of_dwarves_title:0 "The Place of Dwarves"
 g_the_place_of_dwarves_desc:0 "Are dwarves worth keeping around?\n\nIt is not an easy question. They have killed us by the millions, denied us the richest parts of the Dwarovar, forced us into desolate caverns. Certainly, they will be taught their place under [Root.GetName]. But is that in a shallow grave, or do we have some use for these mud-crawlers?"
 g_the_place_of_orcs_title:0 "The Place of Orcs"
 g_the_place_of_orcs_desc:0 "Are orcs worth keeping around?\n\nNo goblin who ever spent time in orcish chains would ever say so. But given our ascendancy, and the rate of population turnover, few alive today have. And their brute strength could definitely be useful, if properly channeled. Decisions, decisions, decisions..."
 g_the_place_of_kobolds_title:0 "The Place of Kobolds"
 g_the_place_of_kobolds_desc:0 "Are kobolds worth keeping around?\n\nThese lizards have always been far and few between in the Serpentspine, but it is just that fact which means they have never done much to offend goblinkind. Perhaps there is potential for them to take the sort of menial tasks that a goblin would despise... or we can simply get rid of them, head to tail."
 g_goblins_are_great_title:0 "Goblins are Great"
 g_goblins_are_great_desc:0 "You know what are great? It's a tricky question, so take your time.\n\nHad long enough?\n\nHow about now?\n\nThe answer is obvious: goblins. Goblins are great."
 g_reinforcing_goblin_hegemony_title:0 "Reinforce our Hegemony"
 g_reinforcing_goblin_hegemony_desc:0 "We have shown every other race their place in [Root.GetName]. Let's make sure that extends to their nations, too."
 
 g_our_mountains_title:0 "Our Mountains"
 g_our_mountains_desc:0 "We have lived in these mountains since long before the dwarves crawled from the mud. We must make that clear, and rule it from deepest cavern to tallest peak."
 g_the_expansive_underempire_title:0 "The Expansive Underempire"
 g_the_expansive_underempire_desc:0 "We have seized the largest, and richest, region of the Serpentspine. The dwarves' high capital, the orcs' birth-place, they fell before our munitions. And soon the rest of the mountains shall fall as well."
 g_a_goblin_serpentspine_title:0 "A Goblin Serpentspine"
 g_a_goblin_serpentspine_desc:0 "The dwarves claimed them, with road and hold. The orcs ruled them, slaughtering any who stood in their way. The hobgoblins controlled them, with wicked whips and slave-chains.\n\nBut no more. These are our mountains now. The Serpentspine is, and forever will be, goblin land."
 g_serpentspine_diplomacy_title:0 "Serpentspine Diplomacy"
 g_serpentspine_diplomacy_desc:0 "Our rule is secure, but the frequency of explosions in goblin engineering has taught us you can never go wrong with a few extra supports. Some careful diplomacy might be just the reinforcement that ensures our dominance for centuries."
 
 g_the_capital_of_goblinkind_title:0 "The Capital of Goblinkind"
 g_the_capital_of_goblinkind_desc:0 "We have lived in the dark expanses of the Serpentspine as mere disorganized clans for as long as we have known, clawing away at the earth for simple treasures like precious stones and metals, content to live on petty thrones atop meager hoards. With our kin united under a single banner, we require a strong seat of power to solidify our influence, one fit to rule over the great hoard that is the entirety of the serpentspine!"
 g_election_reform_title:0 "Election Reform"
 g_election_reform_desc:0 "The squabbling of those within our great society have come to a head, with each faction infinitely more interested in their personal holdings with little to no regard for the state they operate within. These institutions have become nightmarish perversions of their original intention, with each looking to create a future molded by their twisted minds. We must free our country of their influence and wrest the reigns of our destiny from those who seek to destroy us!"
 g_the_shape_of_our_society_title:0 "The Shape of Our Society"
 g_the_shape_of_our_society_desc:0 "Our empire is one born from the will of strong goblins, the minds of the brightest inventors, and the savvy of those who wish to carve out their own place in a hostile world by any means necessary. The shape of our society has long been unique; triangular, in part, due to the constant battle between these three sides.\n\nThough it was innovative for a time, we have learned now that all it has done was weaken us, and limit our successes to the whims of squabbling and petty men. Now the time has come for us to reforge this shape into something more substantial, and secure our rule under an unshakable order!"
 
 g_advancing_our_government_title:0 "Advancing our Government"
 g_advancing_our_government_desc:0 "Every goblin agrees that advancement and progress is good. So advancing our government is good too. Some may question the idea that simply adding new aspects to a government is enough to advance it, but the analysts swear we get better at stuff every time."
 g_a_proven_council_title:0 "A Proven Council"
 g_a_proven_council_desc:0 "There were many who thought it couldn't be done. That a council composed of fractious and feuding goblins was a body that could never accomplish anything. We showed them. We showed them all!"
 g_a_goblin_success_story_title:0 "A Goblin Success Story"
 g_a_goblin_success_story_desc:0 "In the streets of the capital, puppet shows that portray a fictional bill being passed into law by the council have become all the rave. This is clearly a sign of our people's pride in their successful council, and not a carefully orchestrated propaganda campaign by a successful council."
 g_the_greatest_of_all_governments_title:0 "The Greatest Government"
 g_the_greatest_of_all_governments_desc:0 "Well we did it. We made the greatest government ever. All that's left to do for the council members is the council Knifeball team."
 
 g_the_goblins_of_the_tree_of_stone_title:0 "Goblins of the Tree of Stone"
 g_the_goblins_of_the_tree_of_stone_desc:0 "The goblins of Eastern Serpentspine were spared the pressures of Dookanson's conquest, allowing them to grow the Undergrowth dens into a force to contend with. It is time to bring together East and West."
 g_emissary_to_the_triarchy_title:0 "Emissary to the Triarchy"
 g_emissary_to_the_triarchy_desc:0 "Goblin ingenuity can match any challenge, even that of the cut-throat trading world. Many of the city goblins of Cannor have developed into skilled industrialists and artificers. The brightest minds of these captains of industry have formed a true technocracy in Aelantir. There is much we could learn from them."
 g_the_goblins_of_the_deepwoods_title:0 "Goblins of the Deepwoods"
 g_the_goblins_of_the_deepwoods_desc:0 "The Deepwoods have been a safe bastion of Goblindom for thousands of years. It is now a war-zone between elf and orc, and it is the duty of the Allclan to preserve a home for our kin there."
 g_the_goblins_of_escann_title:0 "Goblins of Escann"
 g_the_goblins_of_escann_desc:0 "During the Greentide countless clans of goblins were dragged to the surface to serve as fodder for orcish conquest. Now, the remnants of these clans live threatened on all sides by the fractured Escanni. They are citizens of the Allclan by right, and we will defend them."
 g_the_goblins_of_bulwar_title:0 "Goblins of Bulwar"
 g_the_goblins_of_bulwar_desc:0 "Fleeing the consolidation of Dookanson, many goblins of Western Serpentspine escaped into the turmoil of Bulwar and managed to thrive, carving out prominent clans and growing rich off of new opportunities for trade and agriculture. The Allclan will be greatly served by bringing these Exodus Clans into the fold." 
 
 g_move_the_kobolds_to_live_alongside_us_title:0 "Live Alongside the Kobolds"
 g_move_the_kobolds_to_live_alongside_us_desc:0 "There is a kinship between goblins and kobolds. In a world full of those larger and stronger than us, we both need to rely on our wits to survive. The Allclan is willing to accept Kobolds into our ranks."
 g_the_future_of_kobolds_within_ves_udzenklan_title:0 "The Kobolds' Future"
 g_the_future_of_kobolds_within_ves_udzenklan_desc:0 "Every citizen of the Allclan serves a purpose, and the kobolds are no exception. They have proven their value as (second-class) citizens. What role should they play in our great supremacy?"
 
 g_pacifying_the_orcs_title:0 "Pacify the Orcs"
 g_pacifying_the_orcs_desc:0 "Orcs respect strength above all else, and by right of conquest we have tamed the hordes. Let us make sure this is very, very, clear to them."
 g_creating_farms_for_the_orcs_title:0 "Farms for the Orcs"
 g_creating_farms_for_the_orcs_desc:0 "The farms of Serpent's Vale have been restored, we just need the labour to utilize them. This kind of mindless labour will be perfect for our orcish workforce."
 g_getting_the_labor_to_the_farms_title:0 "Orcish Relocation"
 g_getting_the_labor_to_the_farms_desc:0 "It turns out that orcs would rather plunder than farm. Tough. But their fate is inevitable, and we'll get them to Serpent's Vale, one way or another."
 
 g_rounding_up_the_dwarfs_in_our_holds_title:0 "Round up the Dwarves"
 g_rounding_up_the_dwarfs_in_our_holds_desc:0 "With the initial insurrections dealt with, we need to decide what to do with all these dwarves. They surely won't mind being kept in the Ghettos; they subjected our kind to far worse."
 g_making_the_dwarfs_a_minorty_everywhere_title:0 "Make Dwarves a Minority"
 g_making_the_dwarfs_a_minorty_everywhere_desc:0 "The holds overflow with goblinkind, and it is clear to all dwarves in our realm that this land is theirs no longer. Still, they may be of some use, so long as we can truly break their spirits."
 g_dominating_dwarves_title:0 "Dominate the Dwarves"
 g_dominating_dwarves_desc:0 "Dwarves have a well known superiority complex. If they are going to make decent slaves, we will have to show them just how wrong they were to consider themselves better than goblins"
 
 g_building_a_rocket_test_site_title:0 "The Rocket Test Site"
 g_building_a_rocket_test_site_desc:0 "Gunpowder has, for too long, been used in rather unimaginative and uninspired ways. Guns and cannons are excellent, yes, but many within our empire see this usage as a disservice for the insane potential held in this black powder. Acting on their ambitions, the artificers have approached our council with designs of ambitious scope: remotely delivered devices not unlike fireworks... just a lot bigger. It was clear to any sane individual that, at best, these plans were unsafe, prone to backfiring, and could result in the loss of thousands of lives.\n\nSo, of course, we approved their testing almost immediately."
 g_the_first_test_title:0 "The First Test"
 g_the_first_test_desc:0 "Nothing matches the feeling of seeing a prototype come into life, and the sentiment is shared between the many thousands of citizens and scientists who have come to watch the first launch. As our fuse-goblin readies his match to the cheering of onlookers, it is no doubt that this day will go down in history as a day none shall forget!"
 g_rocketry_ambitions_title:0 "Rocketry Ambitions"
 g_rocketry_ambitions_desc:0 "With the failure of the first launch and its glorious explosion death into a thousand flaming pieces, our scientists excitedly went back to their drawing boards and went to work. Some figuring out ingenious means of making the explosions bigger and badder, filling their designs with firebombs and spiky cores; while other more uptight ones kept going on about stability and safety or something like that. While we, and the crowds present at the first tests, eagerly await the results of the first camp, those of the second camp have already come back to us with some very interesting ideas..."
 g_rockets_on_the_rails_title:0 "Rockets on the Rails"
 g_rockets_on_the_rails_desc:0 "The Dwarovar, for too long, has suffered under the weight of unimaginative dwarven design. Perhaps if we were dwarves we would be content with simple carts on rails, left as they are to suffer in perpetual mediocrity. We, however, are goblins, goblins armed with brains and rockets!"
 g_the_hub_of_the_dwarovar_title:0 "Hub of the Dwarovar"
 g_the_hub_of_the_dwarovar_desc:0 "Er-Natvir, as dubbed by the dwarves, was the hold where all the rails led to, the heart of the Dwarovar if you wish, with its veins stretching all across the mountains from the lonely prison mountains to the jade mines of the east.\n\nAnd just like the dwarves, it is a wholly unimaginative site, far too practical and boring. Under our rule we will turn this place into a home of innovation, where new generations of rocket-carts will be created, tested, and then shipped out to see the torchlight of the dwarovar."
 g_tomaz_the_rocket_train_title:0 "Tomaz the Rocket Train"
 g_tomaz_the_rocket_train_desc:0 "Over time a trend has surfaced in the production of our railcarts, their models increasing to greater and greater sizes with every new generation, able to house more goblins with every trip. Recently we were invited to be present in the unveiling of a new model of cart, one that moved the propulsion devices to the very front and back of the model on large carts that were fueled with coal and other such combustibles.\n\nIt takes the name of its inventor: Tomaz the Rocket Train, was as revolutionary as expected, and today we watch with bright eyes its first trip across the Serpentspine, the future of goblinkind no doubt riding on the back of its carts."
 g_the_serpentspine_express_title:0 "Serpentspine Express"
 g_the_serpentspine_express_desc:0 "It has been long since the days of our first steps towards modernizing the Dwarovar, and it's as if just yesterday we were testing the first unstable models of rocket-carts that would derail and crash into the walls of the mountains almost immediately. Now, in the span of barely an eyeblink, we have gone from wooden carts with simple burners to steel-reinforced carriages, ferried by vehicles of goblin make, running on stabilized rockets and fueled by the coal gathered by our own hands.\n\nNow we stand in the birthplace of the first train, ready to unveil its fastest and most powerful descendant yet: the Serpentspine express. And as the crowds cheer, it'll be no time at all before it gets surpassed by something even greater." 
 
 g_the_model_of_a_new_dwarovar_title:0 "A New Dwarovar"
 g_the_model_of_a_new_dwarovar_desc:0 "The dwarven rail, the main means of transportation of the Serpentspine for both goods and live bodies alike has been the lifeblood of any proper and functioning empire that seeks to comes from it. Built by the dwarves millennia ago, this beautiful piece of engineering was probably the only thing they got right in their time hogging our homeland for their greedy palms.\n\nStill, the old design can be improved, as it lacks ambition, far too conservative in its construction for any sane goblin mind to be happy with. It lacks a certain flair, the one thing that makes goblin ingenuity unique and superior among all the races: explosives."
 g_factory_farms_title:0 "Factory Farms"
 g_factory_farms_desc:0 "Space is at a premium in the Serpentspine, not that it's any problem for our engineers for long, a stick of dynamite makes a for a pretty hole and if the engineers remember to put up the pillars, then they can be stable too. But, the problem of feeding our people is an exponential one, critical mass has been achieved in only a couple decades of not dying from each others' explosions.\n\nIt's in this environment where our greatest minds have come up with a solution: build high, not wide. With some of that classic goblin ingenuity, we've turned massive stalagmites into vertical farms, set up with automated hatches and a conveyor system to ease the workload of farmers, freeing more of the workforce into our burgeoning urban centers."
 g_industrial_cavern_quarrying_title:0 "Industrial Quarrying"
 g_industrial_cavern_quarrying_desc:0 "The days of explosives for all of our digging purposes is not necessarily gone, but it doesn't hurt to look into and practice alternative methods of achieving the same thing. With the advent of advanced artificery and technology, we have begun looking into means of getting resources without risking the 75% chance of an unforeseen cave-in caving in the skulls of our workers. And even though goblins love making things go boom, we also love the sight of giant mechanical monsters doing all our work for us."
 g_artifice_mining_title:0 "Artifice Mining"
 g_artifice_mining_desc:0 "Mining and goblins are two things that go together without saying. The dwarves and their greed can never come to match the fervor of a goblin and his entombed treasure, but this has always operated under an inefficient process. Pickaxes and explosives can only do so much, with the former more delicate while the latter being far more entertaining but also far less safe.\n\nWith the resources at our disposal, we have melded artificery with our people to achieve a perfect blend of delicacy, and our own goblin-brand of bombastic technology."
 g_hold_mega_industry_title:0 "Hold Mega-Industry"
 g_hold_mega_industry_desc:0 "The holds of the dwarves may have served their purpose long ago. when we were just mere tribes on the hunt for places to live after years of persecution under the orcs; these places served us well, their depth unmatched by most natural caves of the Serpentspine and infinitely more accessible.\n\nNow we move onto a new phase, the holds were once adequate for survival, and perhaps to the dwarves they still are, but we are more ambitious than that. The holds are more than just cities now, they will become the beating hearts that will support our empire, providing the goods needed to support a new age."
 g_the_dwarovar_for_goblins_by_goblins_title:0 "For Goblins, by Goblins"
 g_the_dwarovar_for_goblins_by_goblins_desc:0 "We were once raiders, barbaric bands and squatters that roamed the Dwarovar for a place we could call home, killing those who opposed us and taking all we could. Now we are more than just that: we are artisans, artists, scientists, craftsmen, and so much more.\n\nLong gone are the days of us scrounging through those blessed to have been born in richer places. It is now us who will provide for our people, the fruits of our labor pouring into every house and home of our once-lost people, their homes now of goblin construction, their food grown from goblin labor, and their goods born of goblin industry."
 g_the_golden_age_of_artifice_title:0 "The Golden Age of Artifice"
 g_the_golden_age_of_artifice_desc:0 "Who knew it would be at the hands of the little-folk, the long-considered 'scourge' of the serpentspine that would oversee a new age? Never to the hostile orcs that once ordered us around as slaves, nor the equally-barbaric dwarves that purged our people from the depths, only to watch helplessly as their great empire fall soon after.\n\nBut now we stand at the precipice of a world that has changed immensely because of us, one where most labor is left to be done by machines, where knowledge and experimentation are key to power, and where the secrets of the earth become more and more known with every passing day and laboratory mishap. Time will only tell if these innovations will be seen by the world around us as anything more than novelties; but for us at least, we can be content knowing that the world will never be the same again."
 
 g_murdering_meddling_mages_title:0 "Murder the Meddlers"
 g_murdering_meddling_mages_desc:0 "In order for Ves Udzenklan and all goblinkind to realize their destiny, we can not be held back by meddling magic users! We must do away with cowardly mages and impotent sorcerers, they have no place in our great plan. Artificery is the way forward for our people, not their worthless trickery."
 g_putting_the_right_guns_in_the_field_title:0 "The Right Guns"
 g_putting_the_right_guns_in_the_field_desc:0 "Guns are the future of warfare and Goblin firearms are the finest weapons in the world, far better than those gnomish toys and human peashooters. But we can do better! Our genius artificers have developed ingenious new ideas in this field, we must utilize our brilliant innovations to bring guns to the next level!"
 g_how_far_can_we_go_title:0 "How Far Can We Go"
 g_how_far_can_we_go_desc:0 "The next step in our grand design has arrived! Our artificers have developed a new device to bring the enemies of goblinkind to their knees. We will begin constructing the rockets that will propel us to greatness, all it takes is the combined effort of our greatest artificers."
 g_they_called_us_mad_title:0 "They Called Us Mad!"
 g_they_called_us_mad_desc:0 "The hour of our victory is at hand! Through the unity of all goblinkind, and the mastery of artificery, we can now construct the ultimate weapon. It shall be the symbol of a new era of Goblin history. The weak "enlightened" races of the surface have underestimated our power for the last time! All that remains is to decide, what will the instrument of Goblin ascendancy be?"
 
 g_ensuring_effective_enforcement_title:0 "Effective Enforcement"
 g_ensuring_effective_enforcement_desc:0 "Victory! The Reformists rule in the Allclan, we must pursue stability, reform, and reorganization throughout our brave land. In order to put our bold plan into action, we must ensure our policy is enforced without question. We shall place Fubaristi agents at every level of the state."
 g_it_would_be_a_shame_if_something_happened_to_those_weapons_title:0 "Careful With Those Weapons"
 g_it_would_be_a_shame_if_something_happened_to_those_weapons_desc:0 "Those crazed artificers must be put in their place. In order to control their tinkering, we must implement wide ranging regulation on artificed weaponry. We do not need to disband them, they are Goblins with a dream just like us, but those madgobs must be wrangled if we are to use their skills for our vision. It is for their own good."
 g_whats_a_little_money_between_friends_title:0 "A Little Money"
 g_whats_a_little_money_between_friends_desc:0 "It is undeniable that the cartels hold a great deal of power in our society. It is only one of the many natural manifestations of the entrepreneurial spirit of our people. The Kartelklanovi Topgobs could be convinced to lend us their support, and scale back some of their more disruptive businesses, all it takes is a little gold and they will dance to our tune."
 g_for_the_good_of_all_goblinkind_i_must_have_that_title:0 "For Goblinkind..."
 g_for_the_good_of_all_goblinkind_i_must_have_that_desc:0 "Our dream, the dream of all Goblinkind is now within our grasp. Old, outdated tribal allegiances have broken down and been replaced by the Fubaristi vision of unity of one clan, the Allclan. We have eliminated our rivals, our vision is realized, but now there are some lose ends to tie up, to ensure our power in the Udzenklan."
 g_securing_sufficient_sources_of_stimulants_title:0 "Sufficient Stimulants"
 g_securing_sufficient_sources_of_stimulants_desc:0 "Our boys have recently discovered a new kind of plant. It makes goblins bounce off the walls, and thousands are getting hooked on it. We have got to get on top of this and make sure it is properly regulated, we'll be rolling in gold! It is far better for this stimulant to be in the hands of our respected dealers, so Goblins from all over know they are getting the finest coffee around."
 g_multilevel_marketing_title:0 "Multilevel Marketing"
 g_multilevel_marketing_desc:0 "We're in the money now! It's a time honored tradition in the Cartels to give our fellows some help in the form of 'fair' deals and loans. Now that the Topgobs run the show, and we can scam without any fear. Of course, it's only right that they pay for protection, it's a new, special tax to help keep them safe and insured. We'll have the whole Allclan in our debt soon enough!"

 g_drugs_are_good_business_desc:0 "We in the Cartels know what the people want, and we have lots of it. Snortshroom? Of course! Stalagsalt? You got it. Buzzbeetles? Absolutely.\n\nOnce we have them hooked, they'll be customers for life. Anything for our loyal people, and they'll pay anything for it! Price doesn't matter when our dealers are the only gobs on the streets!"

 g_the_greatest_crime_is_not_stealing_from_yourself_desc:0 "We've done it! The Allclan is in the pocket of the Cartels, and the bosses are more powerful then they've ever been! We've got every gob in the nation in our debt and totally hooked on our drugs.

 g_emergency_food_supplies_title:0 "Emergency Food"
 g_emergency_food_supplies_desc:0 "The orcs have risen up against us and stormed out into the Vale to seize the main food supply of our realm.

 g_reclaiming_the_vale_farms_desc:0 "We have reclaimed the Vale from the orcish rebellion, restoring the flow of food to the clans.

 g_flush_out_the_dwarves_desc:0 "Our oppression of the dwarves in our realm has led them to rise up against us in the hopes of casting off the goblinic yoke.

 # Allclan Mission Events
 allclan.1.t:0 "Choose our Focus" #Used for allclan.1-4
 allclan.1.d:0 "From humble beginnings skulking in shadowed caverns, our clan has prospered. We have created a uniquely goblin Serpentspine, an Allclan for all goblins.\n\n\nWithout the looming threat of extinction, the various factions of our clan have begun to squabble amongst themselves for dominance. If we don't show clear support for one or another, our union may fail before it even begins.\n\nThe machinists and weaponsmiths have formed a union of technocrats known as the Zukovinkraty. They advocate for supremacy through innovation and invention.\n\nThe once disparate clanbosses and their cronies have banded together to reform the horde into a functional and efficient state, capable of matching the direct control displayed by the great empires of the world. They call themselves the Fubaristi.\n\nOne can never discount the clan in shadows, the Kartelklanovi. The cartels have a strong grasp on all monetary ventures of the clans, and have become a formidable force in the political arena.\n\nAs the unifier of the Allclan, our choice may well tip the balance. Which faction deserves our support?"
 allclan.2.a:0 "The technocrats brilliance has and will illuminate our path!"
 allclan.2.b:0 "It was bold leadership that brought us here."
 allclan.2.c:0 "The cartels provided the cash to make this happen."
 
 allclan.5.t:0 "The Dwarven Decision"
 allclan.5.d:0 "Dwarves are hardy, diligent workers. They are also profoundly stubborn, and demonstrate an intense hatred of all goblins. They may eventually make for good slave labour, but keeping them around may be more trouble than its worth."
 allclan.5.a:0 "Purge them."
 allclan.5.b:0 "Put them in ghettos."
 allclan.5.c:0 "Our current policy is fine"
 allclan.6.t:0 "The Orcish Inquiry"
 allclan.6.d:0 "We have a long history with the orcs. In ancient days we would struggle side by side against dwarven oppression. The mountains still hold vast numbers of orcs, and they will be a valuable resource if we can pacify them. That being said, the tensions inflicted by the Greentide run deep, and there are factions demanding vengeance for their treatment of goblinkind. By any means necessary."
 allclan.6.a:0 "Purge them."
 allclan.6.b:0 "Send them to the ghettos."
 allclan.7.t:0 "The Kobold Quandary"
 allclan.7.d:0 "Kobolds are an interesting lot. They tend to be a nuisance if left unmanaged; stealing gold from the clan's banks, laying traps on otherwise mundane corridors, and generally being pests. However, we do recognize that many in the world would consider us goblins in a similar light. If we can tolerate their strange ways, the Allclan could expand to incorporate the kobolds. If not, well.. they will not be missed."
 allclan.7.a:0 "Purge them."
 allclan.7.b:0 "Treat them as second-class citizens."
 allclan.8.t:0 "A Role for the Kobolds"
 allclan.8.d:0 "Kobolds thrive on purpose. As it stands, that purpose, being to horde wealth, often gets in the way of the plans of other parts of goblin society. Each of the factions envisions a different approach to solving this issue.\n\nThe Technocrats look at kobolds and see minds almost as bright as goblins, but without the ambition to be great. This is excellent. There has been a running problem in goblin technical circles whereby an assistant will stab their superior in the back (often literally) to get credit for a discovery. Kobold assistants will be far more compliant, and as a bonus - more expendable.\n\nThe Reformists see an opportunity to fill vacancies in their least successful sector of their new state: law enforcement. Goblins are free-spirited at best and anarchistic at worst, leading very few to law enforcement. Those that do pursue such a career all want to be the boss, with precincts having almost as much politicking and backstabbing as the Nezkaru council. Filling the ranks with obedient kobolds would solve a world of trouble for the Reformists.\n\nThe Cartels don't much care for the kobolds. They seem to be an uninspired, obedient lot. What the Cartels do care about is kobold gold. New arrivals always seem to have plenty of gold on them, and communities of kobolds always seem to be acquiring more gold than they ought to, even as the community around them seems to lose out. So the Cartels encourage this wealth-seeking behaviour, all they suggest is an extra tax levied across the Allclan, whereby all citizens' taxes will be increased proportionally to the length of their tail. Does this almost explicitly target kobolds? Yes. Does it encourage wily kobolds to self-mutilate to decrease their tax-burden? Also yes. The cartels are comfortable with these implications."
 allclan.8.a:0 "Send them to be lab assistants."
 allclan.8.b:0 "Their muscle will make them good bailiffs."
 allclan.8.c:0 "They can contribute with a tail tax. We've got to ensure that buildings are up-to-code for tailed citizens somehow!"
 allclan.9.t:0 "The Kobolds Spread"
 allclan.9.d:0 "With their new role secured, the tension between kobold and goblin has eased. Throughout our nation tribes of kobolds are settling into goblin communities and improving productivity."
 allclan.9.a:0 "This is good for the goblins (and the kobolds, I suppose)"

 allclan.10.t:0 "Council Debate: How to Move the Orcs to the New Farms"
 allclan.10.d:0 "The Nezkaru council has called a special assembly to deal with the newest item of policy. It is a remarkably calm one, with only two bombings and a poisoning that have disturbed the proceedings so far. The issue currently under debate in the council is that of the orcs, specifically how best to move them to the new farms we have prepared.\n\nThe debate, as it always does, has coalesced into three policies supported by one of the major political factions.\n\nThe Zukovinkraty position is that the process offers an excellent opportunity to test the latest inventions and give our military some practice. Their plan might take longer, but offers to make the enterprise serve a dual purpose.\n\nThe Fubaristi plan is to simply force the orcs to move the old fashioned way. They claim it will be both swift, cheap, and nationally important to allow the goblin masses to push the orcs out as a united effort. No doubt a ploy to win themselves some influence with some of the easier fooled masses, but a workable and likely swift suggestion.\n\nFinally, the Kartelklanovi see this as another opportunity to make money. They claim that the council can encourage various cartels to put their own money into the whole affair by offering farm production futures and land allotments to goblins for sale, meaning more money all around. The hidden impact of their plan is that we will likely make more money selling them once the orcish labor is in place, but the impact might not be so much."
 allclan.10.a:0 "Sounds like a perfect opportunity to test some new weapons!"
 allclan.10.b:0 "Orcs respect strength right? Why not show them some."
 allclan.10.c:0 "Why not just solve it with money? We have some generous donations lined up."

 allclan.11.t:0 "The Project is Complete"
 allclan.11.d:0 "The orcs have been handled. They will bother us no longer... at least, for a certain definition of 'bothered'."
 allclan.11.a:0 "We made the right choice."
 
 allclan.12.t:0 "Council Debate: Showing the Dwarves their Place"
 allclan.12.d:0 "The members of the council are giddy with anticipation as they ready to decide just how to strip the dwarves down to size. Every clan in Serpentspine has tales of how their people were purged, enslaved, demeaned, or embarrassed by dwarves throughout history. Well we're on top now.\n\nThe alchemists of the Zukovinkraty guild put forward plans to engineer a fear gas that can be pumped into the dwarven ghettos. This will create a persistent environment of paranoia, panic, and anxiety. There is widespread support for this plan; show them how it feels to cower in the dark, terrified for your life, feeling like you are hunted at all hours. Soon they'll be begging us for labour assignments just to get free of the gas.\n\nThe Fubaristi think that the Zukovinkraty solution is over-engineered, as always. They think it will be enough to simply treat them how they deserve. Regular beatings to within an inch of their life. Gruel that isn't fit for an Ogre. Forcing them to break rocks with their bare hands. Straightforward will-breaking. Dwarven resilience just means they can get in that much more misery before they break.\n\nLast but not least, the Kartelklanovi suggest using the dwarves' own fatal flaw against them; their greed. Dwarven greed has been the fall of powerful empires. It can tear families apart. With a little incentive, dwarven community leaders can be co-oerced into betraying their people to earn an easy life for themselves, leaving the remainder in a perfectly demoralized and pliable state."
 allclan.12.a:0 "Start brewing the fear gas immediately."

 allclan.21.t:0 "Election Reform"
 allclan.21.d:0 "Goblin elections can be a chaotic affair. It's considered bad luck for your term if your political headquarters doesn't get firebombed a half dozen times during election season. The factions see room for improvement.\n\nThe Technocrats have better things to do than watch the populace get consumed with partisan fervor; there is science to be done! They have drafted a proposal for a greatly streamlined election process. On the day of the election, and no sooner, will bosses announce their candidacy. They will have until end of day to debate, rally votes, kiss hand, shake babies and what-not. At end of day, everything is voted on; clan leaders, guild representatives, legal referendums, and so on. Absolutely no more voting during the rest of the political term. The perfect system for those honestly would do anything else.\n\nThe Reformists want to extend years between elections. Getting goblins to agree on anything takes a long time, more so if you actually want to do anything so complex as legislate. The Reformists want to get things done, and to them that means they need the extra time in power.\n\nOf course, the chaos of the political cycle does benefit some. The cartels' influence over an election is magnified when upheaval is common, funds are low, and tensions are high. Naturally, they support decreasing the interval between elections. Let the bosses play their games, money is the only true ruler of the Allclan."
 allclan.21.a:0 "Consolidate voting, to leave more time for tinkering."
 allclan.21.b:0 "Longer terms are necessary to implement any policy."
 allclan.21.c:0 "The constant churn of shorter terms will be best."

The raucous cheers and hollers were cut short when the ground and ceiling begun to shake and stones started raining from the distant cave ceiling.

Whipped into a fervor by the blatant disregard for their safety, they have begun to protest our actions and demonstrations of rebellion against our artificers have taken the hold by storm. The artificers claim these demonstrations are a mere overreaction, but the damage has been done and strongmen populists have already begun to mobilize their fervor against the rival factions. In the midst of this chaos, lobbyist merchants and the Kartelklanovi have brought forward the logistics of our operation and have provided their own concerns over concerns over the complete lack of profitability these ventures seem to have over time.

Today is the day we remodel this great beast into our own making, implanting state-of-the-art technology to improve its excellence. However, we are faced with a choice, our factions have been long-vying for their own solutions to the issue of the Dwarovar and seek to increase their influence by dictating the flow of the operations in the Serpentspine.\n\nThe artificers seek to use their new patented explosives and are longing to test their experimental formulas and explosives on the hard rock of the Serpentspine, while the populists have whipped up our workers and laborers into a fervor by promising them more control over their governance by allowing their labor to shape the projects, the Kartelklanovi however see another grand opportunity and have offered their own expert laborers and unionsmen to dig in exchange for raw resources they can use for future construction projects. Overall, the future of a goblin Dwarovar is all but assured, the only issue now is by what foundation it is built on."

 allclan.33.d:0 "Goblins are a frantic and energetic sort by default, but that doesn't mean we're as energetic as we wish to be at all times. Sometimes goblins wake up late or are drained by a long night of tinkering and barely surviving catastrophic explosions, unique situations that were simply not possible in the bygone age of strife and conflict. Because of these sleepless situations, the demands of well-to-do goblin researchers and students have stimulated coffee imports, putting us at the mercy of southern and eastern traders.\n\nA strange variant of coffee has long existed in the mines of the Serpentspine known as Rockbite coffee, but its foul scent and absurd necessities of growth make it both unpalatable and completely unviable for growth. That said, this plant has quite possibly the strongest concentration of coffee in its beans, which appear as shriveled up and nasty slivers that have enough caffeine in them to cause a heart attack in an ogre. With recent discoveries and attempts at cross-breeding the plant with more palatable variants from Bulwar, we have successfully created the first commercially viable strain of Rockbite dubbed 'Blackbite', which combines the aromatic property and ease of cultivation of the Bulwari strains with the legendary strength of Rockbite that goblins love."

The Crawler is a masterpiece of engineering, a monster of metal flesh and carbon sinew on six, massive legs meant for traversing the diverse environments in and around the Serpentspine.\n\nWith all the toys a goblin could ask for: pneumatic drills, diamond-tipped buzzsaws, battering rams, and fully automatic weapons systems that need only be pointed at the poor sucker that's crossed the Allclan; piloted by a lucky crew of scrappy inventors and engineers, this mechanical monster is everything a goblin boy dreams of, and nightmare incarnate for all who dare stand in our way."
 allclan.34.a:0 "All the Dwarovar, nay all Halann, shall tremble before us."
 
 allclan.35.t:0 "Industrial Innovation: Cannon Foundry"
 allclan.35.d:0 "The cannon is a means of controlling the primal force that goblinkind has been so enamoured with since the first lightning strike: the explosion. The goblin cannon is a unique sort that applies the science perfected by us and our scientists into a weapon of mass destruction the size of a slightly larger than average cannon, except massed behind in a row behind our soldiers equalling their number.\n\nEver since their creation these cannons were made meticulously, custom crafted to perfection with the supervision of artificers with a level of care not seen in our other creations before, ensuring the perfect amount of boom to both entertain and embolden our soldiers and completely melt any opposition into a fine red mist. The issue comes with this crafting, as the loss of any cannon was equivalent to the loss of hundreds of goblin-hours and grief. That all changes now, however, as we have created the first and only thing of its kind on the planet: the Cannon Foundry, a factory ran by our greatest engineers and artificers to create goblin cannons en masse, ensuring that even if one is lost, there will be a countless number to take their place."

 allclan.36.d:0 "The goblin love for explosions is reflective in all that we have accomplished: our great feats of digging, our foundries and our mines, our weapons and our guns, and especially in our labs and our experimentations. We have always known the negative aspect of this love however, as many will attest to on account of their many broken limbs and even lives lost in this fatalistic love of something so volatile, yet there has never been a point where an explosion occurs where a goblin is not smiling, where they are not filled with a childlike glee in the presence of something so horrific and destructive.\n\nThe Great Bomb was for a long time a theoretical toy to be played with in the minds of goblin children and scientists, 'what is the biggest boom possible?' and our greatest minds have, for a long time been trying to solve this great engineering quandary. We watched in glee as the explosions got bigger and bigger for a time, incrementally growing in size and oomph as the years went by, but the discovery of the applications of a stone once thought of as just a simple novelty had our scientists immediately pouring hours into seeing what could be done with the new material. It had barely any practical application, it turned out, except in the field of explosives, where it erupted with a preternatural force that was unmatched even in small quantities. With that known, we sought out to test its capabilities and drew plans and see what the upper limits of such a thing could be, creating a bomb that would end all bombs...\n\nWith new knowledge and a new weapon in hand, we gathered to see history made as the bomb was dropped and detonated in a remote place beyond the Serpentspine. When we saw what we created, the explosion made by our own hands, well... nobody was smiling."

 allclan.37.d:0 "Goblins are no strangers to substances, whether it be coffee, drugs, or synthetic gunpowder snorted by goblins looking for an insane fix, we are always at the cutting edge of abusing substances to their full potential. 'Work Gas' is a discreet substance that can easily be hosed into the vents of any factory or closed space that significantly reduces worker fatigue and disagreeableness by a whopping thirty percent, upping their productivity by at least fifty. Workers experiencing a Work Gas high are happier, more productive, and less likely to complain about trivial things such as unsafe working environments, and experience a mild buzz that will have them looking forward to work. Take a dose of Work Gas today and up your productivity and your happiness!

One goblin has proposed adding some kind of drill-head to the explosive rounds to burrow through armour before explosion, one is trying to find a better way to destroy walls, another has proposed a devastating chemical bomb that will induce terror in those who breathe it in, and then there are some mad ideas like strapping goblins to a seat on a rocket filled with this stuff. They will have to test the different options thoroughly to figure out which is the best or most possible option and to iron out the many kinks in the designs. But as with everything to do with artificers, it seems, this will be expensive and require many bodies in the tunnels to perform the tests."

One goblin has been trying to solve the issues of artillery used against mass infantry, another is trying to improve our infantry’s ability to do the same, and yet another says they’re working on a weapon that all parts of our army can use in the field. They will have to test the different options thoroughly to figure out which is the best or most possible option and to iron out the many kinks in the designs.

 # Ultimate Weapon Results
 allclan.48.t:0 "Commando Jetpack Harness"
 allclan.48.d:0 "The Commando Jetpack Harness, invented by Okegg of Spider’s Watch, is a brilliant mix of magic, science, and explosives. It contains two modified wands, one bound to Fireball and one to Burning Hands. A button strapped to the right glove casts a fireball spell into a special magically reflective surface within a steel container on the wearer’s back which propels the energy from the fireball spell back out of the chamber with great force, allowing the wearer to leap great distances. A button strapped to the left glove allows one to cast burning hands, blowing a constant stream of forceful fire out of the container, allowing the wearer to hover in place briefly or glide for short distances.\n\nWe have already equipped and trained squads of commandos with these and they have proven most effective at getting behind enemy lines to attack and harry the enemy before the main army is in range."
 allclan.48.a:0 "Strike from the skies brothers!"
 
 allclan.49.t:0 "Super Duper Boots"
 allclan.49.d:0 "The appropriately named “Super Duper Boots”, invented by Bârog Snotfinger, of the Snotfinger clan, are indeed super duper. Though they are more like a magically powered mechanical exoskeleton than just boots but he claimed that wouldn’t roll of the tongue as well. Powered by a magical dynamo mounted on the back, the boots allow the user to move with great speed and alacrity by magically strengthening the legs and feet whist the exoskeleton itself has had a permanent Haste spell cast on it. Our soldiers report that they are able to close distances with ease on the field and are able to patrol much larger areas."
 allclan.49.a:0 "I am speed!"
 
 allclan.50.t:0 "Mega Crawler"
 allclan.50.d:0 "The Mega Crawler is a great lumbering beast of a machine invented by a stellar team of artificers from Yedab’s Nest, headed by the brilliant Dhoulza Spiderwretch. Dhoulza designed the Mega Crawler after the great spider Yedab, with eight mighty steel legs powered by coal fired engines all encased in magically enhanced steel plates to protect those inside.\n\nThe Crawler can be run a very high speeds and heats for a brief period, thus allowing a fast charge into enemy lines. The engines can be cooled by a water source constantly running through a Box of Permanent Chill Touch (another invention of Dhoulza’s) to keep them from overheating while charging and there are light guns mounted in portholes throughout the side-plating of the Crawler to allow the crew to attack those surrounding them. The machine can also vent fresh boiling-hot steam onto the enemy below them. These have proved devastating on the field, no line able to stand against so much weight coming at them at such speed."
 allclan.50.a:0 "None shall stand in our way now!"
 
 allclan.51.t:0 "Drill Shells"
 allclan.51.d:0 "The Drill Shells are an interesting mix of fine metal craftsmanship and the careful application of high explosives. Invented by a forgemaster from the Underlair, Urimguk Railskulker, he was inspired by the fluted barrels in gun that create spin on bullets, allowing them to fly straighter.\n\nHe carves the shells themselves for the cannons in such a way that they are spinning when they leave cannon barrel with a pointed end facing forwards. As it leaves the barrel a wand of Haste and a wand of Heat Metal both cast their spells on the shell speeding it up to incredible speeds and heating it white hot so that when it contacts a surface, it drills straight in like a knife through butter before exploding. These have proved very useful for dealing with structures and armour alike."
 allclan.51.a:0 "Their armour is meaningless now!"
 
 allclan.52.t:0 "City-Cracker"
 allclan.52.d:0 "The City-Cracker Bomb, developed by Neevnûz Snotfinger, is a special bomb designed to explode in way which deals the most structural damage to defenses possible.\n\nShe designed the explosive to work in three stages, each separated by a magically reinforced steel layer: the first happens upon impact, a lighter explosive goes off with all of its energy reflected off the thick steel layer straight into the impact site, destabilizing the outer layer. The second stage launches the bomb forward with an explosion at the rear and a Heat Metal spell on the front to push it deeper through the now-cracked layer it first hit. The final stage is a mix of extremely densely packed high-explosives and a thundering spell which will go off together in the depths of the structure, bursting it from the inside and destroying or deafening everything around it. There has yet to be a fortification that has survived even a single of these shots."
 allclan.52.a:0 "All their base will belong to us!"
 
 allclan.53.t:0 "Fear Bomb"
 allclan.53.d:0 "The Fear Bomb, a devastating explosive that releases a hallucinogenic gas made from a special fungus cultivated by Ugol Spiderwretch. He was able to take the effects of the normally mildly hallucinogenic mushroom, distilled it to a potent concentrate, and combined it with a spell of Fear. The gas, when breathed in, will cause even the staunchest defender or bravest soldier to be confronted by a terrifyingly real vision of their deepest fear.\n\nThis has proven exceedingly effective at ruining enemy formations in a heartbeat, with the soldiers either collapsing from the fear, running away screaming, or attacking each other in fits of terror-induced madness. So, all in all, a great success."
 allclan.53.a:0 "Not the bees! No, please, not the bees!"
 
 allclan.54.t:0 "Rotary Artillery"
 allclan.54.d:0 "A brilliant goblin artificer named Zhorg came up with a brilliant idea. One cannon barrel is great! Why not add some more? Or a lot more? And so the first Rotary Artillery piece came to be, an enormous 4-barreled cannon mounted on a reinforced rotating frame.\n\nTwo crew members load the shells into a special case which is connected to the frame by a small ramp. The shells are fed into the bottom-most barrel as it passes by and when it reaches the top, it fires. Two wands at the bottom cast Mend and Chill Touch on each barrel as it passes to keep them from breaking under the immense strain and heat produced by firing cannon shot so fast. The crews we have trained are capable of firing up to 30 shots per minutes before they have to stop to let the gun cool naturally and restock the shell loader. Truly devastating."
 allclan.54.a:0 "Our cannonballs shall darken the skies!"
 
 allclan.55.t:0 "Boom-Boom-Boom Gun"
 allclan.55.d:0 "An artificer from Railsright, Azukor Truedagger, has made a new firearm with three barrels. This gun allows our soldiers to fire three shots per volley instead of one, and due to the three-shot cartridge Azukor also designed, they are able to reload it in a fraction of the time a normal gun could be. Soon the trifold booms will become synonymous with the Allclan’s armies."
 allclan.55.a:0 "This is getting out of hand. Now there are three of them."
 
 allclan.56.t:0 "Many-Booms Launcher"
 allclan.56.d:0 "In a rare collaboration between the Truedagger artificers and those of the Railskulker clan, goblins Garm and Takra have invented a gun which can be used anywhere by anyone.\n\nHalfway between a cannon and an infantry gun it can be carried by any goblin due to it having a Feather Fall spell embedded in the metal to make it very light. It fires a larger shot than a standard infantry gun faster than a cannon can normally shoot and is loaded by special cartridges which teleport the shot straight into place within the barrel. This means it can output a great deal more firepower than anything else in our, or anyone else’s, arsenal."
 allclan.56.a:0 "Our armies shall rain lead death upon their foes!"
 
 allclan.57.t:0 "Land Mine Launcher"
 allclan.57.d:0 "Lagba Truedagger has created, what she calls, a revolutionary new tool in every general’s arsenal. The Land Mine Launcher is actually a rocket which has compartments throughout its shell which are filled with land mines. A general can have them set up before a battle begins to fire behind enemy lines. The compartments open just before the rocket impacts the ground and release their payloads from a rotating disk which flings the mines around the rocket’s trajectory so as to distribute them nicely across the area. This means when pushed, the enemy army finds their retreat cut off by a minefield they never knew was there!"
 allclan.57.a:0 "They’d better hope their minesweepers can act fast."
 
 allclan.58.t:0 "Nibbin's Flamethrower"
 allclan.58.d:0 "Nibbin Railskulker is a fuel specialist who has been working on our rocket development for some time. He recently discovered that the fuel, when mixed with tar, can be highly pressurized and so can be pushed through tubes at great speed. This wasn’t helpful to our rocket experiments in the end, but it did reveal something else.\n\nThe material is so incredibly flammable, but the tar mixed in causes it to burn slow and hot. Nibbin figured that one could spray this mixture upon an area and then ignite it afterwards to create a field of fire. This idea then evolved into his special Flamethrower, as he calls it. The flamethrower spits the pressurized mixture out over thirty feet in front of the user and a wand of Spark mounted underneath the spout can ignite the stream at a moment’s notice. This devastating fire “sticks” to things it touches and burns for long periods of time with no extra fuel sources, melting through organic material and metals alike."
 allclan.58.a:0 "They say the thing can lay your very soul to waste."

 allclan.59.t:0 "Goblin-Guided Missile"
 allclan.59.d:0 "A Truedagger artificer, Etrega, has had a very interesting idea bear fruit. She had the thought to attach a seat onto a rocket loaded with explosives so that it could be controlled in real time by the rider. The goblin would be able to steer the rocket straight at specific targets, eliminating the need to calibrate and properly aim every shot.\n\nThis means no rocket will ever miss its mark again. The seat will eject at the last possible second and has a permanent spell of Feather Fall on it so that the rider will not be consumed in the explosion and will be able to glide slowly down to the ground, unharmed."
 allclan.59.a:0 "Aaaaaa hoooo! Waaaaa hooooo!"

 allclan.60.t:0 "Assault Machine"
 allclan.60.d:0 "The Assault Machine, a true beast invented by a team from the Railskulker manufactories. The team leader, Pushkrimp Railskulker, describes it as “a moving fortress of death”.\n\nSeveral layers of steel plate pushed along by tracks on the sides. It has rifles mounted along its length and a large cannon mounted on top. The crew can run the engines hot to get bursts of speed, special spells of Chill Touch keeping the engines from overheating whilst doing so. This allows the Assault Machine to close distances extremely quickly and doors in the back and front allow the troops stationed inside to strike out at any time."
 allclan.60.a:0 "Tankery, Here It Comes!"
 
 allclan.61.t:0 "Twenty Good Goblins"
 allclan.61.d:0 "Some generals and artificers from the Thieving Arrow clan got together to train and equip an elite group of commandos to be deployed with each army. These will be the most well disciplined, skilled troops in our armies. Not only that, but the artificers designed special packs which, with the press of a button, allow the wearer to cast invisibility and Spider Climb on themselves. This allows them to infiltrate defenses before the main army arrives or during sieges to disable key targets to weaken the enemy’s defenses, or simply open the gates for us."
 allclan.61.a:0 "These here are the sneakiest goblins you ever won’t see."


 # Propaganda Campaign
 allclan.62.t:0 "Propaganda: Suffering From Success"
 allclan.62.d:0 "In our systematic elimination of clan loyalties within our nation, we seem to have forgotten an important factor… It’s rather nice to have an excuse to get rid of troublesome goblins. While this praise of “unity” helps us to shape a strong state, it brings trouble when we find someone marching to the beat, but not furthering our aims. Those folks who take our ideology a bit literally, and grow too sincere in their goals to uplift the weak, the unprofitable, and those who in general do not contribute to our state. We’ve been tripping over our tongues to find an excuse in persecuting these troublemakers, and the useless gobshites for whom they advocate."
 allclan.62.a:0 "Who needs excuses? We’ll just get rid of them now and explain later."
 allclan.62.b:0 "Let’s bide our time, help others see this as we do."
 
 allclan.63.t:0 "Propaganda: Working on a Plan"
 allclan.63.d:0 "After careful deliberation, we’ve manufactured just the right narrative to trod upon those we disdain. Returning to tales and records of our conquest of the Serpentspine, we’ve found tale after tale of feral, unwashed goblins who lived outside of civilization. If we can link the destitute, the deviant to these savages, we can exclude them from our nation make them less than a goblin. By portraying undesirables as these “squatters”, a term stolen from the rhetoric of the dwarves who sought to steal away our home, we can rid ourselves of them on a whim. As the name isn’t reflective of any extant group in our society, it’s easy enough to apply to anyone we don’t like."
 allclan.63.a:0 "A fine plan, we’ll find an opportunity when it comes."
 allclan.63.b:0 "Let’s not waste time. Start the presses!"
 allclan.63.c:0 "Our 'friends' are seeing eye to eye with us here."
 
 allclan.65.t:0 "Propaganda: Creating the Moment"
 allclan.65.d:0 "While spreading rumors and rhetoric of the squatters among our people in our speeches and other communication has been somewhat effective, it’s time to go all in on this. Our top strategists have spent long hours scheming, and have produced us a fine pair of plans. Firstly, they propose that we create a false flag attack, having some of our spies lead or pay off a group of disadvantaged layabouts to raze the [Root.Capital.GetName] Center for the Unfortunate, get them shouting some nonsense about not needing help from another clan. Seeing as this first situation could turn a bit volatile, we could simply ramp up our efforts to spread the idea of squatters among our people, passing laws, filling the streets with fliers and speeches, and sending our forces to raid the gatherings and homes of those who work against our goals, in the name of eliminating this elusive threat."
 allclan.65.a:0 "Let’s be careful now, we’ll speak of enemies, not make them."
 allclan.65.b:0 "Oh, no! Look at how the "squatters" are tearing our nation apart!"
 
 allclan.66.t:0 "Propaganda: End - A Little Help From Our Friends."
 allclan.66.d:0 "While we were able to sway our rivals to unite against those beneath us, there’s no such thing as a free lunch. We’ve had to pull every favor, grease every wheel across all areas of our government to appease competing interests. While it hasn’t been easy, we’ve assuaged concerns that any goblin of good stature could be confused for these feral squatters that have been properly ostracized from the identity of our people."
 allclan.66.a:0 "The price of co-operation."
 
 allclan.67.t:0 "Propaganda: End - Casting Doubts"
 allclan.67.d:0 "To be a squatter isn’t just to be outside of our society, but to be unfaithful to it. All these silly ideologies contesting our own? Straight from the minds of squatters! With these ideas firmly ingrained in our people, it should be easy enough to see our rivals out of power, and push our ideas as the only ones that truly befit the civilized goblins of [Root.Country.GetName]. Now that the concept of squatters has firmly wormed itself into the brains of our citizens, they’ll find themselves wondering… Am I a squatter? Surely, they’ll redouble their efforts, commit themselves more fully to our cause, that they might not be revealed as a squatter among us."
 allclan.67.a:0 "We are the only rulers the people need."

 allclan.68.t:0 "Propaganda: End - Squatting Spreads!"
 allclan.68.d:0 "If you tell a lie often enough, make it big enough, it can become truth… And we wish someone had told us sooner! While before our efforts, the squatters we spoke of simply didn’t exist, we’ve created them! Young goblins, who see fit to rebel against our government have adopted the concept of squatters into their ways. Now, street gangs call themselves “clans”, and go around literally squatting on the corners of our streets. Fortunately for us, some of the more intellectually inclined have looked into the etymology of our terminology, and decided that, not only should they be squatters, but Dwarovar Squatters. Fortunately, a common error in translating between our tongue and that of dwarves has lead to many of them squatting on our repaired dwarven rails, rather swiftly ending the problems they were set to create."
 allclan.68.a:0 "If we wait long enough, maybe they’ll all go squat on the rails!"

 # Drug Development
 allclan.69.t:0 "Drug Development: Decisions"
 allclan.69.d:0 "There is potential, brewing and bubbling in goblin laboratories. It has come to [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s attention that we could perhaps benefit from concentrating that potential into illicit and powerful substances, which would rival in effect the most potent of potions. Where shall we focus our efforts?"
 allclan.69.a:0 "Let's make some hallucinogens"
 allclan.69.b:0 "This stuff can make you feel realllll good."
 allclan.69.c:0 "Look into the rumors from the underbelly of Krakdhûmvror..."

 allclan.70.t:0 "Drug Development: Determined Denials"
 allclan.70.d:0 "Next to the sprawling facility that is our drug-making laboratory are a bunch of relatively-normal goblin businesses. Apparently they do not enjoy the co-location benefits, complaining that the smoke causes strange and vivid nightmares, while runoff has contaminated the water (and warped the local frogs' mating rituals). How shall we handle these upstarts?"
 allclan.70.a:0 "Buy them out."
 allclan.70.b:0 "Maybe we can organize a merger?"
 allclan.70.c:0 "Take no rash action: my second-favourite brothel is there!"

 allclan.71.t:0 "Drug Development: Done"
 allclan.71.d:0 "It takes on a lovely orange colour, swirling in the vial presented to [Root.Monarch.GetName]. Inside, the fruits of our labour, we can begin mass production at once. But where shall we target our marketing?"

 allclan.71.b:0 "Foreigners will enjoy this, our coffers will too."
 
 allclan.72.t:0 "Drug Development: Done"
 allclan.72.d:0 "It is a white powder, that fills the vial presented to [Root.Monarch.GetName]. The chemists inform [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] that it has been nicknamed 'Krak', by the place of its birth. We can begin mass production at once, but where shall we target our marketing?"
 allclan.72.a:0 "Krak will be good business."
 allclan.72.b:0 "Sell it to the humans."

 # Jaw Street
 allclan.74.t:0 "Jaw Street: The Founding"
 allclan.74.d:0 "Jaw Street, named for the toothy, jagged stalactites and stalagmites that ring its looming entrance. While originally used by the Gob boss “Big Jaw Jergel” to shake down folks who didn’t hear his associates right the first time, the place has of late become a home for a much more modernized, and civilized form of swindling. Jergel has taken to encouraging anyone he’s having a little chat with to invest in certificates of ownership known as “stocks” belonging to the merchants and businesses that pay for his “protection”. Furthermore, these papers seem to be more and more valuable as time goes on. While we’re still wrapping our heads around this particular racket, we could surely skim some coin off the top before it falls apart."
 allclan.74.a:0 "You see, things have value because people think they have value..."
 allclan.74.b:0 "Does seventy-thirty sound like a fair split?"

 allclan.75.t:0 "Jaw Street: Seed Capital"
 allclan.75.d:0 "Much to our surprise, Jaw Street is booming! Impressively, it’s become the premier way to make your money into even more money, beating out gambling and alchemy with its lower risk of bodily harm. While we’d only expected this particular scam to last for a few months before there needed to be a show of rounding Jergel up for his crimes, and admonishing any of our own who participated in this, his stock market has caught on fire, in every sense of the word. With the smoke clearing, these incidents have inspired better bookkeeping practices, and a fair deal of fights over the lost documentation. Regardless, everything is coming up green for the goblins down on Jaw Street. However, some naysayers suggest the bubble may be bursting. Should we cash out, or hold? If we stay in, and legitimize this venture, we’ll need to more officially integrate it into our economy."
 allclan.75.a:0 "Let’s take the bag, and run with it!"
 allclan.75.b:0 "Open the treasury, this is too big to fail!"

 allclan.76.t:0 "Occupy Jaw Street"
 allclan.76.d:0 "Jaw Street firms have consolidated hoards of wealth that would make monarchs blush in the hands of a scant few more exclusive than elves, say the people in the streets. Many have lost everything, or have become outraged that so many of our people live in poverty as our leadership grows exponentially wealthier. While we hardly care, being those lucky few ourselves, it has been pointed out that firstly, it seems detrimental to the ideal of the Allclan, that we might be leaving our people to starve. Secondly, the sticks that those signs are tied to do look quite excruciatingly pointy. Perhaps we should address the issue, before they decide to give us a closer look."
 allclan.76.a:0 "Get rid of them! If they’ve got no money, what are they worth?"
 allclan.76.b:0 "Surely, their leaders would be glad to take a few charitable donations."
 allclan.76.c:0 "Yeah, sure, but have you seen my golden stool yet?" 
 
 allclan.77.t:0 "Jaw Street: Capital's Capital"
 allclan.77.d:0 "While the original entrance of Jaw Street proved pitifully small for its booming traffic, the artistic rendition that replaced it has more than sufficed to capture the extravagance and luxury of the place, a set of golden teeth, an idealized form of those jagged jaws now arches up from the floor surrounding the road, between the lanes, and from the ceiling above, a savage, toothy grin that reflects the cut-throat nature that remains as a holdover from its shady past. The walls of the way are lined with windows into bustling offices, shimmering storefronts that offer the perfect place to turn those stocks into more tangible luxuries. While whispers persist that the heart of our nation has shifted from the council’s chambers to the floor beneath the big bell at the exchange’s center, it’s hard to deny that the place gathers coin on every surface like a misty morning leaves dew."
 allclan.77.a:0 "I can see, smell, taste, feel, hear the money pour in!"
 
 # Rocket

 allclan.79.t:0 "Rocket: The Launch Pad"
 allclan.79.d:0 "The site is ready and rocket is prepped. The whole crew responsible for this amazing feat has been invited to watch. But I suppose we could always sell tickets to those who were not involved, to offset the costs a bit and make this more of a spectacle."

 # Allclan Crisis Events
 allclan.800.t:0 "Something went wrong."

For their own protection, the dwarves are only allowed outside with a valid permit, usually issued by their place of employment. Forcing the dwarves into this centralized location has made them far easier to manage and given the workshops of $PROVINCECAPITAL$ several powerful tools to exploit them for cheaper or more labor. The dwarves may complain, but it's not like they can rebel or anything."

In the days of squabbling and finger-pointing since, only one thing has been agreed upon. The council decrees that it’s time we come up with a formal meal plan for these meetings. And we better hurry too! Things are growing heated enough that our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] may end up on the dinner table if it isn’t solved quick!"

Unable to find the proper resources and support to properly fund their work, young and rebellious artificers have been sticking up people on Jaw Street, and less importantly, all across [Root.Capital.GetName] and in cities across our nation. While purse-snatchers zooming by in their spiderless carriages and golem enforcers shaking down our impeccably honest entrepreneurs were bad enough, a bandit making off with a satchel of certificates from the exchange lit the fuse on the Bowling Lava-tube Rocket, and took it straight through the ceiling.

Our intelligence states that, in a move nearly so tricksy as to rival our own ingenuity, they’ve covered themselves in green paint! While some among us ridicule the very notion, the word of the Fingerton detectives has hardly led us astray before."

Demonstrators gathered, both in support and opposition to the hunt for these painted dwarves. As word spread, our people took it upon themselves to round up anyone unfortunate enough to be especially hairy or ‘dwarflike’. The mess was only exacerbated when the Fingertons fired on the agitated crowd. Soon, fires began to break out in every corner of [Root.Capital.GetName]. While we’ve had to muster every resource to get the situation under control, the smoke is clearing and our people have scampered off into the shadows once more."

After several days of fighting inside the council building, several of the warring factions allied with each other to take out those who remained alone. As we clean the blood out of the upholstery, we must think of what consequences might come from this. Reason has suffered a grave defeat and will probably be turning into a fascist dictatorship within the next 20 years."

 # Technocrat Debates

 allclan_council.101.t:0 "Council Debate: Too Many Guns?"
 allclan_council.101.d:0 "Ambitions of creating a modern, 'civilized' society for goblinkind have created a very small but very vocal faction of dreamers who imagine a peaceful society in which violence is rare. This ludicrous idea has sparked a more specific debate about the number of guns held by the citizenry -- some are beginning to say goblins have 'too many guns', as though it's possible to have too many. However, this does raise an interesting question about what our policy should be on the private ownership of firearms, and the usual suspects have started up a rancorous debate on the matter. No one is suggesting that we get rid of the guns, of course."
 allclan_council.101.a:0 "Let's leave the status quo be, what's the worst that can happen?"
 allclan_council.101.b:0 "I fail to understand the question."
 allclan_council.101.c:0 "The right to carry them? That can be purchased, for a fee." 

 allclan_council.102.t:0 "Council Debate: Artificers in the Chambers?"
 allclan_council.102.d:0 "Though council debates are amusing at first, arguing with the same people all the time can get boring. Some of the council's artificer members have asked for permission to work on their projects inside the chambers during the council session. Supporters of the rule change claim this would help ensure that there will never be a dull day in the council chambers, but opponents of the measure have demanded we leave the rules as they are, claiming that the artificers will become more insufferable and condescending if allowed to work in the chambers. Both points are valid. What should we do?"
 allclan_council.102.b:0 "This change seems reasonable!"

 allclan_council.103.t:0 "Council Debate: An Offer of Guns"
 allclan_council.103.d:0 "A group of politically controversial manufacturers is trying to rehabilitate their reputations by offering the state a number of big guns. This has created quite the stir in the council, as it pits the goblin urge to hold grudges against our natural love of explosive weapons. What to do?"
 allclan_council.103.b:0 "Who doesn't, like, need more guns?"
 
 allclan_council.104.t:0 "Council Debate: Weird(er) Science"
 allclan_council.104.d:0 "Some of our most daring researchers have requested permission to investigate what they are terming 'weird science'. A bit redundant, because all science is weird, but this is definitely the weirdest yet. Very few on the council understand what they're talking about when they use fake words like 'luminiferous aether' and 'fluid dynamics', but anyway they promise they'll be able to blow things up with it eventually. The representatives of the technocratic Zukovinkraty faction don't really understand the science either, but they do understand that such funding will give their group greater influence. Should we fund this pursuit?"
 allclan_council.104.b:0 "How very intriguing... and promising."
 
 allclan_council.105.t:0 "Council Debate: A New Cannon Laboratory?"
 allclan_council.105.d:0 "One of the great problems with studying cannons and other big guns is the conflicts that inevitably arise when someone gets killed during the testing, as well as the very loud noises that such experiments create at all hours of the night. In order to resolve these problems, some have suggested the construction of a new cannon laboratory in a former dwarven hold, with strict rules on only setting off the quieter explosions at night. The hold has plenty of useful non-living targets, but some worry that such a lab could hand undue influence to the Zukovinkraty technocrats."
 allclan_council.105.b:0 "I can almost hear the explosions already."

 allclan_council.106.t:0 "Council Debate: Fund a Bigger Academy"
 allclan_council.106.d:0 "The Little Academy of Artificery has asked for additional funding, upon which it will be renamed the Really Big Academy of Artificery, with the actual construction of additional buildings to follow some time later. Supporters among the Zukovinkraty point to the fact that ours would be the only Really Big Academy in the whole world, as well as to the fact that additional progress in artifice would surely help the state achieve its ambitions. However, others suggest simply renaming the academy without a corresponding increase in funding, suggesting that the technocrats have received enough assistance already."
 allclan_council.106.b:0 "Brilliant thought must be paid for in gold."

 allclan_council.107.t:0 "Council Debate: The Colour of Explosions"
 allclan_council.107.d:0 "A particularly acrimonious and violent debate has rocked the council over the course of the last few days, and it is clear that the various factions are at an impasse. Only our wise leadership can break the tie on one of the most pressing issues of our time: what colour ought our explosions be? Right now, anyone can simply use any colour for explosions. However, the Zukovinkraty technocrats claim goblins would feel a sense of unity and national pride from standardized explosion colours. Various subgroups of the Zukovinkraty have presented us with explosives in their colour, and we are to announce our decision by setting one off in the council chamber."
 allclan_council.107.b:0 "Yellow!"
 allclan_council.107.c:0 "Salmon!"
 allclan_council.107.e:0 "Green!"
 allclan_council.107.f:0 "Absolutely no color at all."

 allclan_council.108.t:0 "Council Debate: A New Military Base"
 allclan_council.108.d:0 "With all the innovations in artifice and military technology, many in the technocratic Zukovinkraty faction have come to believe that the time has come for the creation of a dedicated military base that can serve as a central hub for both the development and testing of our new devices. However, approving such a base will no doubt create serious division over where it ought to be located, who ought to run it, how it ought to be funded, what food will be served in the cafeteria, and other questions of pressing importance. Opening up such difficult debates will no doubt open the door to political and social conflict."
 allclan_council.108.b:0 "I want it in the shape of an octagon!"
 
 allclan_council.109.t:0 "Council Debate: Superweapon Labs"
 allclan_council.109.d:0 "Recent breakthroughs in our understanding of the underlying laws of nature have given us insight into how we might use those laws to create weapons of fabulous destructive power. With these so-called 'superweapons' in hand, none in the world will dare to ever disrespect us goblins again! Of course, to actually build those weapons, we'll need an appropriately ominous lab. The process of approving and constructing the lab will no doubt raise tensions, but the Zukovinkraty technocrats assure us that the promise of power will be worth it."
 allclan_council.109.b:0 "True military mastery nears..."

# Reformist Events

 allclan_council.111.t:0 "Council Debate: An Insubordinate Governor"
 allclan_council.111.d:0 "The governor of one of our occupied holds has recently been expressing an all-together unhealthy amount of independent thought, and seems to have convinced himself that he doesn't need to follow instructions from the central government. Between his deviation from approved color schemes to committing twice the acceptable amount of embezzlement, it's clear that something needs to be done. The reformist Fubaristi have demanded we make a public show of curtailing the governor's authority."
 allclan_council.111.a:0 "Everything is fine as is."
 allclan_council.111.b:0 "Rein this delinquent in."
 
 allclan_council.112.t:0 "Council Debate: A New Courthouse?"
 allclan_council.112.d:0 "The reformist faction in the council has begun to clamor for a newer courthouse with greater capacity. Our current justice system simply does not have the ability to respond to the high levels of criminality, and so enforcement has been lax. Of course, goblins are proud of their traditional right to be criminals without having to worry too much about enforcement, and building a larger courthouse will probably irritate some."
 allclan_council.112.b:0 "Let's build a new home for justice."

 allclan_council.113.t:0 "Council Debate: Control of the Food Supply"
 allclan_council.113.d:0 "One of the great and contestable issues of our time is the food supply -- specifically, who decides what sort of food gets distributed. The reformist Fubaristi have splintered into two sides on this issue. Some have argued that we need a central Culinary Administration to handle all issues of food. Others suggest explicitly delegating control to the governors of our various provinces. A third group, unaffiliated with the reformists and mostly in the pocket of the culinary syndicates profiting off the current ramshackle and chaotic situation, suggests we simply leave everything as is."
 allclan_council.113.b:0 "The bureaucracy, and beverages, and bacon, must be centralized."
 allclan_council.113.c:0 "Let the governors apply their skills as gourmands."

 allclan_council.114.t:0 "Council Debate: Citizen Obligations"
 allclan_council.114.d:0 "Everyone knows that part of having a glorious unitary state for all goblinkind is that our citizens owe the state certain obligations. The only problem is that no one has actually figured out what those obligations are. Right now, administrators, governors, and other officials are mostly just pretending to wield the authority to compel citizens to do certain things. Reformists are proposing two competing packages: in the first, citizens can be compelled to provide dangerous labor and military service to the state, known as the 'death' package. In the second, citizens will have to part with their precious gold, known as the 'tax' package. How should we proceed?"
 allclan_council.114.b:0 "They shall have death."
 allclan_council.114.c:0 "They shall have taxes."

 allclan_council.115.t:0 "Council Debate: The Smaller Nezkaru"
 allclan_council.115.d:0 "The chaotic, rambunctious, and sometimes violent proceedings of our council have been progressing at a steady pace for some time now. Unfortunately, some dignitaries believe that they are missing out on all the fun. We tried to tell them that really, the council meetings are at least fifty percent listening to boring speeches, but they didn't listen. This group is demanding we expand the number of seats on the council and let them in, and the reformist Fubaristi faction has taken up their cause for inscrutable reasons relating to 'equitable participation and representation', or something along those lines."
 allclan_council.115.b:0 "Fine, let them join the cacophony."
 
 allclan_council.116.t:0 "Council Debate: An Administrative Nexus"
 allclan_council.116.d:0 "In order to ensure effective and competent administration, the Fubaristi reformist faction have demanded we approve the construction of an administrative nexus that can serve as the central hub for the bureaucracy. Such a nexus would cut down on delays and substantially improve the ease with which different parts of the government can communicate with one another. However, opponents argue that stuffing a bunch of ambitious goblins in one room has historically produced unfortunate consequences."
 allclan_council.116.b:0 "It shall be the brain of [Root.GetName]."
 
 allclan_council.117.t:0 "Council Debate: A Food Storage Facility"
 allclan_council.117.d:0 "The Fubaristi reformists have come up with a proposal for centralized food storage facilities. If the central government controls the food, they control the stomachs of the population. And if you control a goblin's stomach, you control him! For obvious reasons, some are wary of this project, claiming that giving the government too much power tramples on their 'liberties' and 'freedoms'."
 allclan_council.117.b:0 "Everyone loves silos!"
 
 allclan_council.118.t:0 "Council Debate: Internal Tariffs"
 allclan_council.118.d:0 "Worried about the growing power of the merchant classes and the challenge they could pose to their centralizing reforms, the Fubaristi have demanded we erect internal tariff barriers that would extract taxes from merchants attempting to move goods between our territories. The merchants are, predictably, upset."
 allclan_council.118.b:0 "Surely the merchants can pay a small fee..."

 # Cartel Events 
 allclan_council.121.t:0 "Council Debate: A New Warehouse?"
 allclan_council.121.d:0 "The association of cartels, or Kartelklanovi, have proposed the creation of state-operated warehouses. Such a project isn't that remarkable, except for the regulations explicitly declaring that the warehouses must remain unguarded for thirty minutes each day with the times transmitted to the cartels. Everyone has so far politely stepped around the obvious fact that the cartels intend to use these warehouses to move illegal merchandise, but there can be no doubt that that is what is going on."
 allclan_council.121.a:0 "Maintain the status quo."
 allclan_council.121.b:0 "We always need more storage space."
 
 allclan_council.122.t:0 "Council Debate: External Tariffs"
 allclan_council.122.d:0 "The Kartelklanovi are most infamous for their participation in smuggling and other illegal activities, but the cartels are also the representatives of most of our nation's legitimate business interests as well. These businesses have faced increasing pressure from foreign goods, and have demanded the state erect external tariff barriers to protect our high-quality, patriotic, definitely non-criminal artisans."
 allclan_council.122.b:0 "Non-goblin goods are simply not good."

 allclan_council.123.t:0 "Council Debate: Market Control"
 allclan_council.123.d:0 "The emerging internal markets of the nation are chaotic and disorganized. Some local administrators have tried to enforce government control over the markets, but without explicit legal backing many have moved to underground markets. The Kartelklanovi are divided -- some want the government to hold power over markets, since the cartels are themselves part of the government. Others want a free market so that they can operate without fear of political reprisal. Everyone is agreed, however, that clarifying the situation will be good both for business and the political fortunes of the cartels."
 allclan_council.123.b:0 "This is power, yes? Then it shall be in the council's hands."
 allclan_council.123.c:0 "As long as freedom means more money, let there be freedom!"

 allclan_council.124.t:0 "Council Debate: A New Industrial District?"
 allclan_council.124.d:0 "The cartels and other business interests have proposed the construction of a vast, modern industrial district that makes use of the newest and best methods for production, both foreign and domestic. This would require the displacement of some people and the destruction of a few dozen homes, but such minor costs are small prices to pay in the name of economic progress."
 allclan_council.124.b:0 "I want the smoke to be smelled from miles away!"
 
 allclan_council.126.t:0 "Council Debate: Tax Cuts?"
 allclan_council.126.d:0 "There is probably nothing a goblin hates more than taxes. Having to part with one's precious wealth just to hand it off to some people who are going to tell you what to do are absolutely antithetical to goblinhood. Besides that, a bunch of fancy professors seem to believe that high taxes 'stifle economic growth', which sounds like a great pretense for cutting them! Of course, taxes are sort of important for the function of government..."
 allclan_council.126.b:0 "Like a knife through a dwarf's guts, let's cut the rates."
 allclan_council.126.c:0 "I, and my esteemed colleagues, should not owe any taxes!"

 allclan_council.127.t:0 "Council Debate: Production Subsidies"
 allclan_council.127.d:0 "The more respectable members of the Kartelklanovi have laid out the current financial system of the nation's industrialists -- they're doing well, but they need money to expand faster. The sooner they can get new workshops up and running, the sooner their goods will be pouring into the markets and earning both themselves and the state a nice profit. To make this happen, they have asked for direct subsidies."
 allclan_council.127.b:0 "Spend one coin on the furnace to make a dozen from the forge."
 
 allclan_council.128.t:0 "Council Debate: Orcish Farm Subsidies"
 allclan_council.128.d:0 "Our orcish subjects are notably great farmers, hence why they've been so cruelly enslaved by the so-called 'civilized' races to work on plantations and farm estates. Our much more benevolent and enlightened leadership still leaves them stuck on the farms, where they belong, but they get to have dignity while they do it. Some in the Kartelklanovi have suggested we extend this benevolence further to subsidize the farmers directly so that they can invest in more efficient tools and methods."
 allclan_council.128.b:0 "Sow one coin, reap a dozen more."

 allclan_council.129.t:0 "Council Debate: Local Subsidies"
 allclan_council.129.d:0 "Representatives of provincial business elites have requested specific and direct subsidies to their local operations, with promises of increased production and higher revenues in return."
 allclan_council.129.b:0 "An excellent investment, like every one the Council makes."

 allclan_council.131.t:0 "Council Debate: Fort Privatization"
 allclan_council.131.d:0 "Forts are very expensive. Expensive forts mean expensive taxes, which, as has been made very clear by the violence and bickering in the council, are very unpopular. Some have suggested privatizing the forts instead to reduce the cost burden on the central government. Some even claim, on the basis of nothing more than raw imagination and willpower, that these privatized forts will be of higher quality than the public ones!"
 allclan_council.131.b:0 "Our people will sleep safe, knowing they are guarded by market forces!"

 allclan_council.132.t:0 "Council Debate: A BIG Loan"
 allclan_council.132.d:0 "With the state having so many possible avenues for investment and expansion, and with such limited funds, a group of very enterprising financial elites, industrialists, and definitely-criminal cartel kingpins have offered to make the government a substantial loan to fund these additional activities."
 allclan_council.132.a:0 "Bah, your money is not as good as my own."
 allclan_council.132.b:0 "I'll take it all, thank you."
 allclan_council.132.c:0 "Oooh, money, yes please!"
 allclan_council.132.e:0 "Why yes, I'd like money. All the money."
 
 # Elections

Once more, the season of our republic's elections is upon us, as the relative peace of our nation grows brittle and frail. We can only hope that someone comes out on top, and puts an end to these troubled months. What say the Nezkaru?"
