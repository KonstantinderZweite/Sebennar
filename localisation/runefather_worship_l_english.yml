 runefather_worship.1.t:0 "Choose Your Allegiance"
 runefather_worship.1.d:0 "Our years of loyalty to our chosen benefactor have been long and arduous, but we must decide if they were fruitful enough. Advisors scramble in the court, arguing for their choice of allegiance to suit their own goals, but the final choice lies with the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle].\n\nWill we continue our support for our original choice or risk their anger by betraying them and choosing another to show our loyalty to."

 runefather_worship.100.t:0 "Contact From Below"
 runefather_worship.100.d:0 "Sleepless and wandering alone in the dark halls of [Root.Capital.GetName], [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] has heard some whispers deep in the hallways. Venturing to investigate what kind of schemes are at play at the dead of night, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] walked closer to what seemed like an unnatural darkness, slowly closing in with the whispers resounding much more audibly.\n\n[Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName].\n\n[Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName].\n\n[Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName].\n\nFear overwhelmed [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] body as [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] name echoed louder and louder through the space, with an eerie otherworldly voice. “You have proven to be a strong leader, however your nation reeks of weakness. True power can only come from the Runefather, my power that has dominated the vast lands below you and soon the caverns you reside in. You have a choice, prove your worth and serve me, or perish beneath the faithful. Prepare to sacrifice anything.”\n\nThe darkness suddenly disappears, and just as quickly, the torches flare up with roaring fires. A remaining echo filled the mind of [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName].\n\n“Do you accept?”"
 runefather_worship.100.a:0 "This is preposterous!"
 runefather_worship.100.b:0 "True power you say?"
 runefather_worship.101.t:0 "Test of Faith"
 runefather_worship.101.d:0 "Eagerly expecting for the Runefather to contact [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim], [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] once more wandered down dark halls, desperately listening for any whispers and extinguishing torches just for the chance of the Runefather contacting [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] again. Many sleepless nights had passed, as [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] began to lose faith, however in the most unexpected time, many whispers suddenly filled [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] mind and darkness covered the room.\n\n“Sacrifice”\n\n”Show no mercy, no failure and no hesitation. Sacrifice one dear to you, to demonstrate your willingness to follow my decrees, so that you may never hesitate ever again. With blood you will pay the price of power so high beyond your understanding. It is only the strong that can make a decision so unforgivable by your kin. Abandon your past self and devote all to the Runefather.”\n\nAs quickly as the whispers and darkness had appeared, so did they all fade away. With such a difficult decision, [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] alone debated whether to sacrifice their kin, or abandon such deranged actions."
 runefather_worship.101.a:0 "This price is unforgivable."
 runefather_worship.101.b:0 "Abandon love. Embrace power."
 runefather_worship.102.t:0 "The Last Step"
 runefather_worship.102.d:0 "With a hardened heart, [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] has been ruling with an iron fist, awaiting further instructions from the Runefather. Shunned by [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] kin, while admired by the military, there is almost no hesitation left to complete the last step. [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] knew that the nation must fully embrace the will of the Runefather, just as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] has done.\n\nThe estates must be the first to follow in the steps of [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName], rooting out the weak and making worthy acolytes. Dismantling the clergy of the false faiths and implanting the Runefather’s Will deeply into the heart of the nation is the utmost prerogative, so that none will stand in his path."
 runefather_worship.102.a:0 "This cannot be allowed to continue."
 runefather_worship.102.b:0 "Openly profess dedication to the Runefather."
