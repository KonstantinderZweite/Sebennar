 flavour_themarenn.1.d:0 "For many years, House Sweetcastle has basked in an unparalleled autonomy within the realm of Themarenn. With the devastating Lilac War now but a sorrowful chapter in history, the young Count Vernell III aspires to usher Themarenn into a prosperous future. To do so, he must resolve lingering issues and address the extensive privileges granted to the nobility.\n\nUpon ascending to power, Count Vernell dispatched one of his most loyal generals to reclaim Yearncliff from a rebellious local lord. With Yearncliff now secured, opposition to the Count’s directives is expected to be minimal as he turns his attention to House Sweetcastle.\n\nNonetheless, a path of diplomacy may yet prevail. By extending some concessions, we can revoke the old treaty, thereby reinstating Sweetcastle and its ruling house as loyal vassals. This decision will undoubtedly bear long-lasting consequences, so it must be made with the utmost care and wisdom."

 flavour_themarenn.2.t:0 "A Deliberation"
 flavour_themarenn.2.d:0 "The sages of Esmaria have long held their younger counterparts to lofty standards. Within the realm of Themarenn, save perhaps for Konwell, the populace enjoys some of the highest levels of literacy in Esmaria, a testament to their prosperity. Whispers, discussions, and deliberations among the young and the lost frequently arise, questioning their religious affiliations. Positioned at the crossroads between Esmaryan and Ryalan centers of influence, many have the privilege of choosing the path of their faith and belief.\n\nAs a young teenager, such deliberations led Adelar Hearthcliff to journey to Esmaraine, hoping that the priestesses of Esmaryal could quell the tempest within his mind. He dedicated years to studying in prestigious schools under renowned scholars, visiting the Mother's Sanctuary weekly for prayers, and aiding in the distribution of charity throughout the city. Yet, enlightenment eluded him. The nature of his studies only multiplied his questions: Why was there a divide between the Temple of the Mother and the Daughter? Why were there multiple gods? He despaired of finding answers among Esmaryal’s devotees.\n\nThus, he ventured to Ryalanar, seeking what the Ryalites might offer. Immersing himself in the Ryalan perspective on life, he rose through the ranks, becoming recognized as a wise philosopher and attracting a circle of students who sought his counsel. During a reflective moment in Ryalanar, he became acutely aware of his surroundings: all this fame, all these followers—were they, too, seeking answers? Why did they pose their questions to him when he had no answers himself? For weeks, he secluded himself, pondering these thoughts. Then, an epiphany dawned upon him: perhaps, all this time, he had possessed the answers to these questions. Maybe that was why people sought his thoughts."

 flavour_themarenn.3.d:0 "Gathered around a table once more were the vanquished of the Fourth Lilac War in Esmaria. Surprisingly, the mood was vibrant; everyone socialized and boasted of their heroic deeds during the conflict. Contrary to the Count’s presumption, the council did not require any investment to be constructive—the very fact that all members of the Moon Party were assembled, laughing off the war over a glass of wine, was victory enough. The Duke could now simply approach different guests and discuss his own agenda.[Root.GetThemarennCouncilDesc][Root.GetThemarennCouncil2Desc][Root.GetThemarennCouncil3Desc][Root.GetThemarennCouncil4Desc][Root.GetThemarennCouncil5Desc]"

In true dwarven fashion, with complete disregard for formalities, the Grand Master called out to our Duke.

 themarenn_council_desc_f:0 "\n\nAt the farthest corner of the hall, the Duke's gaze was drawn to the Count of Bennon, standing alone, swirling wine in a near-full goblet. Approaching the somber Count, the bittersweet mood was palpable—the loss of Count Frédéric weighed heavily on the alliance. Offering solidarity once more, Duke Vernell, raising his head high, said, “Fret not, my friend. His sacrifice was not in vain, for the courage of Bennon shall be remembered forever.”\n\nMoving to the center of the hall, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] raised his glass and proclaimed..."

While her contributions to the stability of the region has been invaluable, eventually she will need an heir. Having forseen the future, she is afraid that the vultures in Telgeir and Terr who fought her realm during the fourth lilac war might use this oppurtunity to usurp her realm. During his childhood, Vernell III spent years in Gabmoríonn while his parents were busy fighting in the war, away from home. Under the tutulage of Lady Isobel, he made friends with other orphans that she raised and learned about Esmari traditions, literature and history. Now he is in a position to return the favour by protecting his ward's legacy.\n\nIsobel herself has expressed interest in naming one of her adopted sons as the heir, a talented young man named Arodan, one of Vernell's best friends growing up.\n\nOn the other hand, the nobles of the realm suggest Vernell himself approach Isobel and convince her that he can lead both duchies and protect her people."

All present noticed one significant absence:Esmaraine.\n\nTaking the podium [Root.Monarch.GetName] began by recounting the tales of the fourth lilac war, laying bare the numerious dissappointments and shortcomings for all to hear. Each misstep was traced back to a single source: The hub of deceit, the spider's den, where evil lurked just beneath the surface Esmaraine!\nTheir twisted motivations and ambitions, tailored to suit the needs of their infernal overlords, had continualy hindered the party, thwarting the chance of victory.\n\n"No more!," The lord of Themarenn proclaimed. “If Esmaria is to find respite, the root of all evil must be banished from the realm. The last Hedini hideout must be seized and purged.” [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] continued to implore his allies for assistance, assuring Themarenn’s supporters that when they strike at Esmaraine’s heart, the entire corrupt core will collapse, revealing their treachery for all to see."

 flavour_themarenn.6.d:0 "In our efforts to promote the Esmari nobility back to their original duties, we have also encouraged patronage of arts and crafts, as well as innovative thought. Thanks to this resurgence, many an artisan or painter have been inspired to creat great works, laying under the shadow of the Lake Palace and trying to add their pieces to its great collection of arts. Meanwhile, others have had other, grander ideas.\n\nWhile raised in a merchant family in Yearncliff, Buel's talents in architecture and history were quickly recognized by the local nobility and under their patronage he was sent to Konwell and then Anbenncost to study in a veriety of fields such as history, architecture, arts, and natural sciences. And so it was that he returned after ten long years having studied and built up a reputation across the Empire, and offered his services to his patron, now the fief of Yearncliff. Under his supervision, castles and manors would be built, and the coastal infrastructure would be revamped to accomodate for more ships, fueling the everlasting rivalry between Yearncliff and Costroad. Having completed his duties to the local lord he would then present himself in front of the ducal court in Themarenn, offering to work on the Lake Palace, his life-long dream.\n\nWhile the Lake Palace has been effectively decomissioned since the fall of the Grand Duchy of Esmaria, the royal librarian informs us that he has preserved the original manuscripts about the foundations and structure of the monument, we need but to provide the funds so work could begin. In the meanwhile, some in court have suggested we hire Trystan Buel as an advisor to serve the court, while others think his time would be better spent teaching the next generation of artisians."

Ever the punctual one, he'd prepared his documents and coins by seven, and headed to the city at eight. Sure enough, by nine he stood in front of the building. But curiously, a long queue snaked out the entrance.\n\n"Ah! Look who it is, our old chum Arturian," quips an elderly man already in line.\n"Good morning, Bren," Arturian replies, joining the queue behind his acquaintance. Catching his breath, he asks, "What's all this then?"\n"Hm? The line?" Bren echoes, surprised.\nPuzzled, Arturian inquires further, "Well, yes. Why the long face?"\n"Seems like you missed something, my brother," Bren points to the bank building. "Ever since Silverlar got taken over, most of our old officials were ousted. The bank president and most of the clerks included. Now we have to deal with the Esmari."\n"I... see." Processing this, Arturian continues, "But that doesn't answer my question."\n"Huh? Are you dense? It's the Esmari! They don't know the meaning of orderly, on time, or even doing their job. Hence the line. People came, the bank was closed—no clerks, no president, not even guards awake."\nAlmost catching on, Arturian's interest piques. "They appointed Esmari officials, and now everything's in chaos?"\n"Yeah, the ol' bastards are probably laying near the riverbank, drunk out of their minds. I wouldn't be surprised if they forgot they had a job."\n\nFeeling duped by city life once again, the poor countryside man Arturian vows to avoid the city for the rest of his life."

Oh, this is embarrassing.”\n“Hush, give me a moment.”\n“After rejecting all those Nobles and their bouquets, a human? You can’t be serious…”\n“Well... maybe I was just not-”\nA sudden interruption, brought about by her own thoughts. Approaching the two friends, a young man, no older than thirty, walks confidently towards them.\nPari’s friend glances at her, “Are you blushing? You’re blushing, aren’t you?”\nShaking and confused, she replies, “Stop it you!” as the man draws nearer.\nOne hand rests on his sword hilt, the other gently following his steps. He finally speaks, “Fair ladies! A moment of your time, if I may!” The two elves brace for the encounter, and Pari is rooted in place, her cheeks the brightest blush.\nThe man bows gently, offering his hand, which Pari accepts with a trembling grasp.\n“A lovely afternoon to you!” He rises to meet their gaze. “Drosten Brightsprings - adventurer of Themarennic calling, at your service.”\nMoments pass, there is no reply.\n“Ahem-” he clears his throat, “May I ask the lovely lady her name?” he inquires, glancing at the Elf’s hand still holding his.\nEmbarrassed, she quickly withdraws her hand, “Pari, a pleasure.”\n“The pleasure is all mine!” replies the man with a charming smile.\nTurning to Pari’s companion, he continues, “Oh! And how could I forget!” as he repeats the gesture.\n“Cyralyn, nice meeting you,” replies the other woman begrudgingly, noting Drosten’s gaze lingering on Pari.\n“Excuse my bluntness, but seeing you fair ladies alone, I couldn’t help but ask-” The adventurer takes a moment to look ahead of where the elves stood. “Do you happen to be with another group? My fellows and I, sailing down from Ibevar, wondered if you’d join our barge.”\nTaken aback, Cyralyn looks to discover Pari completely frozen and speechless. Such an offer would scandalize Ibenionian norms, but their new human overlords have different ideas on social customs!\n“We’d be honored to have you. We have bards, magicians, and most importantly, good cooks onboard. It will be an experience of a lifetime!”\nBefore Cyralyn could respond, Pari’s deepest thoughts escape her lips, “YES!”"

Her breakthrough at Oldpassage and the subsequent invasion of Esmaria with her minions culminated in an event known as the Slaughter of Esmarwic, during which tens of thousands of innocents lost their lives, including most of the old Esmari royal family. Consequently, the only remaining “legitimate” heir to the throne was Lauren the Lecher, a distant relative of the old royal family. His incompetence and indulgent lifestyle were a stain upon the history of this blessed land, leading to the final demise and fracturing of Esmaria.\n\nAlas, not all was lost, for heroes rose to meet the challenge.\n\nThe Black Castanorian commander who partook in the invasion of Esmaria, Drosten River-Reaver, had witnessed the nobility of Castanor be tarnished during these events, and eventually turned his loyalty away from the Sorcerer-King to the people of the land, supporting their struggle for freedom. He would  lead his armies and the River Reavers—an elite guard unit trained by and fiercely loyal only to him—to liberate the rest of occupied Esmaria and join the League of Free Realms, leading the League to numerous crucial victories. On his journey, he met the love of his life, a freed elven prisoner named Saelihn. Hoping to create a better future for all who depended on him, Drosten refused the unjust Treaty of Anbenncost, which demanded the return of all Esmari land, and continued to rule and bring prosperity to his domain, which would be named Cann Esmar.\n\nDuring Cann Esmar’s apex, elvenization in the region reached new heights as arts and culture flourished, and the Drostening dynasty, the progenitor of House Themarenn, maintained order and prosperity."

Twin brothers Alarain and Vincen Redcoaster are famous across the dameshead for their maritime construction business; Docks, Harbours, Shipyards, Trade Depots and everything related to that area of construction is within their territory. Though inexperienced in country-spanning projects, they do offer high levels of expertise in dealing with canals, water levels, dams, and things of the sort, plus they have a veteran corps of skilled labourers to make sure the project goes smoothly.\n\nLastly, an outsider but not one from far away; A Gnomish Engineer by the name of Bobbman Netherfinger has appeared before the court, he is quite famous for his exploits in the field of artifice, but also infamous for running risky experiments. He promises to deliver a grand canal using the most modern and cutting edge devices, ones that the world has never seen before, but he also requires a generous amount of resources and crowns to work with.\n\nNow it is up to the Lord of Themarenn to choose a favourite and have them start planning for the project."

From tales of heroic charges by the River Marines to the devastating artillery barrages of Yearncliff's 1st Combined Naval Battery-Artillery Regiment, and under Casetin’s valiant leadership, Themarenn has earned a reputation worthy of Adean’s heroes.\n\nWith this, we can now lay down our arms and turn our focus inward. It is time to repay the loans that funded our artillery efforts and stabilize the country."

In order to stabilize the situation, then-count Vincen II allowed his fiefs to stay out of the war on the condition that they pay their taxes. But with the endless successive wars, Themarenn’s own pool of levies and funds ran short, and eventually, during the Fourth Lilac War, count Vernell II, under siege and with little hope, agreed to a humiliating deal with his own subjects, granting them nigh total freedom in turn for their involvement in the war. Now, the young and firebrand count Vernell III seeks to amend these unfair treaties, having already replaced the fief of Yearncliff with a loyalist, he looks towards the arrogant house of Sweetcastle next."

Back in the day, under the Grand Duchy of Esmaria, these noble-ministers were better known as Esmari stewards. The Stewards were to represent the best of Esmaria, be cultural ambassadors, respected diplomats, and be patrons of art and architecture. The first step to restoring their reputation is creating the infrastructure for these operations to be carried out. Namely, temples, public offices, renovation of palaces, and recruitment centers. Our capital of Themarenn is one of the most prestigious locations in the entirety of Cannor already, with clean roads, functioning services, and administrative buildings, certainly better than the unsightly and infernal-infested neighborhoods of Esmaraine!"

So far, many attempts have been taken to restore the old Lake Palace of the Grand Dukes of Esmaria. But the intricate and frankly complicated engineering and architectural know-how to maintain such a grand palace has been lost to us. There are hopes amongst the Sewards that maybe one day, one of these new creative minds will find a way to rebuild the palace back to its former splendor…"

Having migrated to Esmaria in the 11th century alongside Drosten himself, these men of the north chose to remain fiercely loyal to their liege and bring glory to the old duchy of Cann Esmar, winning war after war, battle after battle, siege after siege. It is now up to us to carry their legacy on our shoulders and do them proud.

These men are not just any soldier, they are some of the most highly trained warriors in all Cannor, hardened veterans of many conflicts, survivors of merciless tides, and bearers of the legacy of Drosten ‘River-Reaver’. Their reputation usually precedes them; foreign strategists and tacticians refer to them as ‘Themarennic River Marines’, study their moves, and learn from their courage and bravery, truly, what people rush to witness every morning are the sons of Drosten."

So graceful is this gift of nature that even through the harsh and bloody battles fought near its shores, it remained calm, offering peace of mind to all those who take a moment to ponder. Yet that should not be an excuse for its caretakers to overlook the state of decline the coastal cities are facing.

People of Themarenn city itself, the largest city in the country, follow Esmaryal, the mother goddess, who brings fertility to the land, a warm hearth to all homes, and watches over families, keeping them safe and prosperous. On the other hand, the majority of the rest of the country, especially in our provinces west of Themarenn, those of Ryalanar, and Sweetcaste, and Yearncliff, or further south near Konwell, revere Ryala more than other deities, the goddess of love, beauty, courtship and purity.
