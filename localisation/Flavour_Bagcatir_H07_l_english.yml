 bagcatir_never_again_title:0 "Never Again"
 bagcatir_never_again_desc:0 "Bagcatir is the sole republic in Eordand, run by the cooperation of powerful merchants allied together for the exclusive freedoms they enjoy. Founded in ages long shrouded, Bagcatir broke free from a polity that Dearktir claims its roots from, the ancient tyrant state Drisleak. They came to us again demanding servitude based on dusty ancient claims. Today we have put an end to that threat!"
 merchant_lord_connection_title:0 "Merchant Lords Connections"
 merchant_lord_connection_desc:0 "The sea of Eordand is not the place for weak hearted people. Ships captained by ruthless merchants roam free, running their own trade and sometimes stealing from others. All naval trade in the region goes through them, while the other despot of Eordand seek to eradicate the Merchant Lords, our proud Republic has other ways to deal with them. Their ships are perfect to turn against our enemies and run free of blockade, while their free nature meant that they swore no fealty towards anyone. If we can cut a deal with them, we might have enough arsenal to project our strength and spread our influence against our rivals."
 bagcatir_pretender_of_pelomar_title:0 "Pretenders of Pelomar"
 bagcatir_pretender_of_pelomar_desc:0 "To the north are the pathetic imposters, the so-called Champions of the Fey. For too long Pelomar has exploited its long defunct title, it is time that they are put down and replaced by those truly worthy."
 bagcatir_heretics_republic_title:0 "Heretics in the Republic"
 bagcatir_heretics_republic_desc:0 "Summer has given us warmth, happiness, and a chance for us to celebrate the good things that happened in life. But not everyone viewed this the same way as us, and certainly not our Selpheregi and Tuathak subjects who viewed us as a cruel oppressor of their faith. That was certainly not our intention, as our Republic was built on the principle that everyone should have the same rights regardless of their background. \nWith more merchants coming to trade with us from the land of the Spring and Autumn worshippers, it’s time to prove that Bagcatir will not discriminate against anyone. The heretics will have their representation in our government, and their merchants will have the same voting power as our faithful. May the Summer bless us and may the Republic live as long as it could be."
 bagcatir_integrate_copperlord_title:0 "Integrate the Copperlords"
 bagcatir_integrate_copperlord_desc:0 "Eordand’s lack of iron deposit meant that Sglard’s vast number of copper deposits became necessary to produce metals like bronze to use as daily tools and weapons. This enabled the rise of the Copper Lords, nobility who held a monopoly of the copper trade in the region. While the discovery of copper deposits in Slegcal has reduced their grip over the copper market, they still possess strong influence especially in their native lands.\n\nWith our recent subjugation of Cardumh, the Copper Lords and their domains have come under our Republic. Despite this, they are still not properly integrated into the society as the pride from their nobility background clashes with our republican tradition. With little help and convincing from our side, we can make them cooperate with us as copper merchants while still maintaining their power and influence."
 bagcatir_whispers_sand_title:0 "Whispers in the Sands"
 bagcatir_whispers_sand_desc:0 "The Fograc tell of a place buried underneath the desert to the southeast by the edge of the Haraf desert. This must be the site we are looking for, the expedition must be set forth there immediately and start the excavation!"
 bagcatir_heathen_republic_title:0 "Heathens in the Republic"
 bagcatir_heathen_republic_desc:0 "Just as we have extended representation and recognition to those who adhere to the other seasons in our republic, we now must consider the status of those who do not adhere to the seasons at all. Our dealings with the Fograc have made the conclusion all but obvious. We must grant them the same rights as any other citizen, and at last move toward integrating the Forgac back into Eordand society."
 bagcatir_burgher_revolution_title:0 "The Burgher Revolution"
 bagcatir_burgher_revolution_desc:0 "Our agreement with the merchant lords has begun to bear fruit. With our investment, they have been able to expand their mercantile influence across Eordand, making contacts and close ties with the merchants of other realms. In addition to generating more profit for our republic, this effort has also given us sway over foreign merchants, who thanks to our merchant lord allies, seem interested in helping us however they can. With a few nudges, we should be able to justify some... Regime changes, to their benefit and ours.\n\n§RThe sudden expansion of our league might lead to unrest.§!"
 bagcatir_mage_republic_title:0 "Mages in the Republic"
 bagcatir_mage_republic_desc:0 "Due to their remarkable skills and potential to contribute to the republic, among... Other reasons, we have seen fit to grant some special constitutional rights to our mage population. They shall of course be allowed to practice magic freely, so long as they do not break any other laws or dabble in forbidden arts. They shall also be granted special representation within our republic, ensuring they are able to effectively advocate for their own interests. This should not only end their resistance to our republic, but encourage them to actively participate in it."
 bagcatir_trade_league_title:0 "Forming the League"
 bagcatir_trade_league_desc:0 "No longer are we but a single city-state standing against all of Eordand. Our expansion has brought more cities into the fold, and their representation in the republic is just as important to consider as that of Bagcatir itself. We must rework our laws and constitution to ensure each city of the League has a say in the affairs of the republic, and that no one city may dominate over any other. In doing so, we shall ensure their cooperation and loyalty, as well as greater mutual prosperity. Let it be so."
 bagcatir_toward_winter_title:0 "Sailing Toward Winter"
 bagcatir_toward_winter_desc:0 "The Snecboth of the north have always been an insular people. Though they are not opposed to engaging in trade or diplomacy, they have typically preferred to keep to their own lands, only truly clashing with the Tuathak in the Autumn Court's crusade to end the Winter. This reclusivity has become inconvenient for us, as the merchants of the north have largely remained outside our influence, and therefore outside our League. If we are to unite Eordand, this must change."
 bagcatir_song_ice_copper_title:0 "A Song of Ice and Copper"
 bagcatir_song_ice_copper_desc:0 "The animosity between the Autumn and Winter Courts is fierce, and long predates us. Unfortunately, it has now become our problem to deal with, as our Autumn Court League members often refuse to deal with those of the Winter Court, and vice versa. This, along with the occasional sparks of religious violence, is completely unacceptable. We must ensure the more moderate members of the Courts are able to sit down and come to some understanding, while their more radical brethren are prevented from causing any more harm."
 bagcatir_eordan_republic_title:0 "The Eordan Republic"
 bagcatir_eordan_republic_desc:0 "Our hard work and diligence have paid off for Eordand. Conflict between the seasons and realms has melted away, replaced with cooperation, electoralism, and trade. Bagcatir's role in this remarkable shift has not gone unnoticed, and it is a common saying that "All are equal under the glow of the Moon," due to the importance of the moon in our culture. In that spirit, we have at last decided to formalize our new order in the so-called Moon Republic. May its glow bask upon us forever more."
 bagcatir_resume_colonialism_title:0 "New Elabarc Initiative"
 bagcatir_resume_colonialism_desc:0 "The lands to our south have always shown untapped potential, and the discovery of gold in Urdoc only proved this to us. Combined with the local Fograc population which has largely kept to themselves up until now, and many of our merchants see the potential for increased commerce. In addition to allotting some funds toward preparing a new colonial venture, we should also send some of our merchants to make contact with the Fograc and see what potential there is for their cooperation in our endeavors."
 bagcatir_heathen_deal_title:0 "A Deal with Heathens"
 bagcatir_heathen_deal_desc:0 "Our trade with the Fograc people has been fruitful so far, but we can do much better. Despite their complete rejection of the four seasons, the Fograc have proven to be surprisingly amenable partners, so long as we don't bring up the fey. Let us organize their leaders together and invite them to formally join our trade league. It will no doubt prove a boon for all of us."
 bagcatir_heathen_deal_tooltip:0 "Fully colonize 5 Provinces with Fograc Natives"
 bagcatir_beyond_eordand_title:0 "Beyond Eordand"
 bagcatir_beyond_eordand_desc:0 "With the success of our recent colonial efforts, a new wave of curiosity and enthusiasm has begun to spread across our society. While in days past, we were content to keep to ourselves and our seasonal counterparts, now we wonder what else lies beyond Eordand. Do more elves live, and perhaps even thrive? If so, is it not our duty to meet them and try to bring our people back together? Increasingly, the answer to that second question seems to be yes."
 bagcatir_unearthed_knowledge_of_cadcimn_title:0 "Knowledge of Lost Cadcimn"
 bagcatir_unearthed_knowledge_of_cadcimn_desc:0 "It has been many years since the Eordan Expedition has started excavating Cadcimn, and many wonders have been found. However, until now only small artifacts and chambers have been found. Now large portions of the original structure have been found, mostly intact. This is a true breakthrough, exactly what we have been missing all this time. We must explore further!"
 bagcatir_urdea_samrad_title:0 "Urdea Samrad"
 bagcatir_urdea_samrad_desc:0 "The colonization of Haraf has been a success, with many Caamas settling in these warm lands honoring the Summer. A wide river and protected harbor, the perfect location for the keystone of our settlement in Haraf, has been found and chartered. It will be called Urdea Samrad, the bastion of the Summer and staging point for all our future endeavours. A grand lighthouse tower shall be constructed, a guiding beacon towards our new land."
 
 #Events
 bagcatir.1.t:0 "Meeting the Merchant Lords"
 bagcatir.1.d:0 "The city of Bagcatir was very crowded for the last few days. Many Merchant Lords, usually stopping by once at a time, anchored their ship in the harbor. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of Bagcatir has invited them to a special meeting, and most of them answered [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] call because of Bagcatiran policy of open port for trading with them. The meeting room was quickly filled with many Merchant Lords of different makes. Some wore their best outfit while others didn't bother getting out of their sea garb. The rowdy crowd was silenced when [Root.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] entered the room.\n\n‘The honorable Merchant Lords, I am humbled to receive you in my domain. But I know that we all rather get to the point of this meeting. I know that life in the Sarmadfar and Elarbarc has been hard, especially with some of the ports under the lords of Eordand closed for business with you. It’s also hard for us to live with these despot breathing down our neck, seeking to destroy our way of life. We have worked wonderfully in the past, and now we have common enemies on our way. I will ask for you to lend us your strength, your ships, and your spirit, and together we will make the land and the sea open for trade!’\n\n‘No offense, but that’s a bit ambitious isn’t it? You asked much of us yet we haven’t heard anything that will benefit us’ said one of the Merchant Lords, with others agreeing with him.\n\n‘How about this, we will give you some upfront investment to help with your endeavor. Once we finished, the increased trade will benefit both of us and you will see any investment doubled’\n\n‘If we have a say in your government, we have a deal’\n\n‘That’s a tough ask, but if it is what it takes’"
 bagcatir.1.a:0 "So, who are we fighting first?"
 
 bagcatir.2.t:0 "Bagcatir Colonialism"
 bagcatir.2.d:0 "Some time ago, a group of our merchants started an unsanctioned expedition in Southern Elarbarc. They established settlements in Urdoc and were said to have made contact with the heathen people of Fograc. Being the merchants that they were, they started trading with the Fograc and started a friendly relationship with them. Despite this bit of history, the unsuccessful attempts at growing the colony outside of Urdoc has branded the expedition as a great failure.\nThe Council of Bagcatir has decided that this failure to be kept as a secret to the public and the other merchants, for a glimmer of hope that we might return there someday. Meanwhile, shocking news had come from Urdoc. The puny settlement was reported to have a sizable gold deposit. The project to return to Fograc lands has gained renewed interest from the council. With the recently acquired resources from our expansion and from the Merchant Lords, we have the means necessary to fund a second expedition to Southern Elarblarc. Not only will it be fully subsidized and have full oversight by the state, we will achieve what our predecessor failed to do and establish a permanent presence in lands of the Fograc."
 bagcatir.2.a:0 "The wind carried us south, and to the south we will go"
 
 bagcatir.3.t:0 "Meeting Our Wayward Cousins"
 bagcatir.3.d:0 "Though the Fograc people are strange in their customs and beliefs, they are in many ways our  kin. Long ago, they inhabited Eordand along with us, perhaps even indistinguishable from us. Yet for whatever reason, they chose to reject the seasonal teachings of the fey. For this, they were exiled to the south, where they have since developed their own unique culture and religion.\n\nDespite this history, there seems to be no lingering animosity. On the contrary, our recent forays into the south have revealed the Fograc people to actually be quite friendly, showing a willingness to trade and cooperate with our settlers, so long as their own beliefs and rights aren't imposed upon. This has prompted some of our colonial organizers to suggest a different paradigm in expanding into the south. Rather than simply settling our own citizens, they have suggested we establish a colonial administration primarily run by Fogracs. Of course, the administration would still be subordinate to Bagcatir, but the arrangement could prove a mutually beneficial one.\n\nTo the credit of the Fograc people, some have already been identified as potential collaborators in this administration. Their role would be to help organize their brethren and ensure their loyalty to us, as well as to help facilitate trade between the Fograc and our merchants. In exchange, we would be expected to grant them a degree of autonomy in their affairs, to protect them against external threats, and to provide them help in consolidating control over the region. So long as we were to keep good on our promises, we have every reason to believe the Fograc will do so in turn, resulting in a tidy profit for us all."
 bagcatir.3.a:0 "Set up the administration immediately!"
 bagcatir.3.b:0 "Let's have a closer look…(Play as Seraeddun)"
 
 bagcatir.4.t:0 "Kalassa Swiftwind"
 bagcatir.4.d:0 "Born in the city of Bagcatir, Kalassa Swiftwind had shown an insatiable wanderlust from an early age. What some might have considered a passing fancy of youth turned into her primary focus in life. Her gaze and curiosity have always been turned to the horizon, wondering just what might lie beyond Eordand. Though we know Eordand is not all there is in the world, we know not what lies beyond our immediate area, or even if anyone else survived the cataclysm which laid our ancestors low.\n\nThat is, we didn't know until recently. Our contact with the Fograc people has led to an interesting discovery. They tell us of elves who live to the south, across a great desert. Though we had long dismissed this as a wasteland, it seems these "Haraf'ne" occasionally travel across it to trade with the Fograc. This news has reached the ears of Kalassa Swiftwind, who has offered her services on an expedition to discover this southern land.\n\nOf course, to travel across an unfamiliar desert would be perilous, and that is far from her specialty anyway. She has instead proposed we attempt the journey by sea, mapping the coast as we go, and seeing if we may meet these elves in that way. Perhaps, she has suggested, we may even find far more if we were to sponsor more expeditions..."
 bagcatir.4.a:0 "It is worth considering, at least."
 
 bagcatir.5.t:0 "Partners Demand Representation"
 bagcatir.5.d:0 "When we first got our independence and determined who had the right to vote, the merchants of Bagcatir, to make sure that those with the powers were invested in the city. Through recently, we've expanded beyond our town, be it by colonial ventures or by our newly acquired trade league members and their merchants don't have the powers ours do and are now issuing demands. If we do not do anything we might lose our newly acquired partners."
 bagcatir.5.a:0 "Let's negotiate."
 
 bagcatir.6.t:0 "Heretics Demand Representation"
 bagcatir.6.d:0 "One of the founding principles of our republic was guaranteed for all citizens. But who counts as a citizen? Our laws have always been Caamas and Summer Court centered but now more and more followers of the other courts are under our authority, they have different rites and all. This has caused unrest to rise, and "Heretical" merchants are helping organize things. If we do not act we might end up with riots or even revolts on our hands."
 bagcatir.6.a:0 "A Merchant is a Merchant, no matter what court they follow."
 
 bagcatir.7.t:0 "Mages Demand Representation"
 bagcatir.7.d:0 "Eordand is a magical place truly, like our precursor mages are numerous, almost everyone can do magic to some degree and for most of it, our magical citizens seemed satisfied enough. But recent expansions are challenging that. The recently acquired mage guilds living in the ancestral cities are more numerous and organized than any we ever had to deal with, some of them even used to ruling a nation themselves and they aren't happy that powers are reserved to merchants. If we don't do anything about it we might soon find our livelihood turned into craters."
 bagcatir.7.a:0 "This was bound to happen one day no?"
 
 bagcatir.8.t:0 "Hibernal Riots"
 bagcatir.8.d:0 "For a while we thought inter-seasonal trouble was mostly a thing of the past, but we've forgotten that other people have grudges. Riots, raids, skirmishes, the memories of the hibernal crusade are still fresh in our league member's mind and each side is demanding us to deal with the other. If we don't do anything this might escalate into a civil war."
 bagcatir.8.a:0 "Why can't we be friends."
 
 bagcatir.10.t:0 "The Status of Seraeddun"
 bagcatir.10.d:0 "Recently, we have begun the process of integrating some of our subject states into the greater republic. This process has led some to consider what we should do with Seraeddun, our Forgac colonial administration. Some have proposed that we maintain our current arrangement in perpetuity, keeping our promises to the Fograc in full and allowing them autonomy under us.\n\nOthers have suggested that we instead alter the arrangement we have with the Fograc. While immediate annexation is out of the question, a few changes to our laws and terms with the Fograc would allow us to move toward integrating them in the future. While this would certainly not be without expense, our relations with the Fograc are good enough that we do not expect them to revolt in this outcome. The choice is now ours to make."
 bagcatir.10.a:0 "Keep our colonial administration as it is"
 bagcatir.10.b:0 "Prepare Seraeddun for eventual integration"

 eordand_moon_republic_reform_desc:0 "Finding its origins in the merchant republic of Bagcatir, the Moon Republic has since evolved into something much more. With its robust constitution guaranteeing rights and representation to disparate faiths and locales, and a strong focus on trade and commerce, the Moon Republic stands as a pluralistic and tolerant force in the normally fractious Eordand. As they now say, all are truly equal under the glow of the Moon."
