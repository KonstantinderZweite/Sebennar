 bagcatir_city_of_free_merchants_title:0 "City of Free Merchants"
 bagcatir_city_of_free_merchants_desc:0 "Bagcatir is the sole republic in Eordand, run by the cooperation of powerful merchants allied together for the exclusive freedoms they enjoy. Founded in ages long shrouded, Bagcatir broke free from a polity that Dearktir claims its roots from, the ancient tyrant state Drisleak. Now they come to us again demanding servitude based on dusty ancient claims. If we are to remain free from Dearktir, Pelomar, or any other that threatens our city, we must uphold our republican virtues that have made our city strong, and trust in our Comhair to make true and strong decisions for us all."
 bagcatir_capitalize_on_elarbarc_tensions_title:0 "Tension among the Elarbarc"
 bagcatir_capitalize_on_elarbarc_tensions_desc:0 "The Elarbarc has been beset by close competition of the rival states Dearktir and Murdkather, often erupting into spiteful war. A thorn in the side of Murdkather, the island of Billel owned by Dearktir forces traders entering the port to pay entry fees. In this great competition we must remain wary and ready for any situation, for at any moment the scales might be in our favor. If this great game were to end, it would cement our future as a free city forevermore!"

 bagcatir_control_the_south_sarmadfar_desc:0 "The south coast of the Sarmadfar is sparsely populated, with little reason to establish communities and control over the region. On the far eastern shores of the Elarbarc near the border of Murdkather a small colony has settled, sponsored by an eccentric coalition of merchants. They claim that the native Fograc people, long thought traitors to the Eordellon faith as a whole, are more welcoming and receptive of our colonies than was previously thought. Now that relative stability has been brought to the region, many Caamasi have thought to venturing into these lands, and possibly settling there. Let us lead this movement and secure an alliance with the native Fograc."
