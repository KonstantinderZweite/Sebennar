Let it be inscribed upon the annals of eternity that these sacrosanct commandments are decreed under the shadow of celestial justice and temporal chastisement:\n\n 1. Sovereign Edict of Naval Restraint: It is hereby enjoined that no principality shall maintain a fleet of war-arrayed vessels within these waters that exceeds numbers ordained by [L62.GovernmentName] of [L62.GetName]. Such vessels shall forswear ordnance of prodigious magnitude or the accoutrements of bellicosity exceeding the bounds of necessity, lest they disturb the divine tranquility herein enshrined.\n 2.

This decree preserves the equitable commerce of nations and thwarts the hegemony of avaricious entities.\n 3. Irrevocable Proscription of Piratical Iniquity: Acts of piracy, brigandry, or aquatic marauding are hereby anathematized and utterly proscribed. Whosoever engages in such accursed deeds shall be rendered accursed, their name expunged from the register of humanity, and subjected to chastisements of unexampled severity.\n 4. Hallowing of Commerce Routes: The sanctified pathways of trade shall remain inviolate and free from obstruction. Any act of impediment, whether borne of malice or negligence, shall summon the swift retribution of the custodians.\n 5. Reckoning for Transgression: Those who defy the ordinances of this decree shall be subjected to a regimen of punitive measures, more grievous and inexorable than the initial precepts. Such penalties shall encompass confiscation, proscription, and eternal exile from these waters.\n 6. Perpetuity of Commandments: These ordinances shall endure unaltered and inviolable for all time, save by the will of [L62.Monarch.GetTitle] of [L62.GovernmentName] of [L62.GetName].\n 7. Seal of Eternal Sovereignty: Let this decree be enshrined under the sacred seal of [L62.GovernmentName] of [L62.GetName], proclaimed to the corners of the Halann, and inscribed upon the tablets of history as an eternal testament to the pursuit of peace and concord.\n\nThus is the Decree of Tranquil Waves ordained and declared, that the waters shall ever remain a domain of harmony, prosperity, and righteous stewardship for all who traverse their breadths."

 #CUSTOM LOC
 L62_prestigious_slave1:0 "One of the warriors caught by our slavers is a terrifying figure. Dark smoke seems to follow him as he walks, and he strikes terror in the heart of everyone who glances into his eyes. He is brought before our representative blindfolded, and he says he is from a Tikur Adanyi tribe, and his people were destroyed by Mengi who had sold themselves to the Night Hags. He is a skilled warrior, and has no qualms about fighting for his slavers."
 L62_prestigious_slave2:0 "During an anti-pirate expedition, a gnollish pack leader was captured. Her grasp of our language was impressive for one of her kind, and as she was taken in chains she promised to reveal the tactics of the pirates she fought with if we spared her life."
 L62_prestigious_slave3:0 "A farmer caught an animal in a trap, only to be shocked when he opened the trap and found a man! He claims to be a Tanizu prince, unfairly ousted by his rivals, and beseechs our representative to return his rightful throne to him in exchange for his loyalty."
 L62_prestigious_slave4:0 "Standing on the auction block is a beautiful Mengi woman, surrounded by a regal aura. Inquiring with the merchant who put her up for auction, our representative found that she was a Mengi princess, captured by pirates and then 'liberated' by Vandiphan sailors. A conversation with our representative revealed her cunning wit."
 L62_prestigious_slave5:0 "Clad in exotic chains of what the hobgoblins call 'korashi' is a Mengi sorcerer, from a village near the Crater of the Martyr. With a somber face, he explained to our representative that he became a sorcerer through contact with the remains of the Damestear Dragon that lie within the crater, and after accidentally unleashing a firestorm that destroyed most of his village, he became a prisoner of his own free will. He is willing to serve us, but refuses to take place in any conflict."
 L62_prestigious_slave6:0 "A Mengi lord comes before our representative dumbfounded. He explains that in one of his raids, the organiser of the defences of the village was not a native of the village, but rather a…harimari? After vigorous questioning, the harimari said he came from a well-established noble family, but had to flee after a palace coup. Fate has brought him here before us in chains, and his place is beneath us now, but he can still be useful."
 L62_prestigious_slave7:0 "The strange, small, pale figure was initially mistaken for a halfling by the slaver-lord selling him. He introduced himself with an incomprehensible name, and explained that he was a “gnome”, a race from distant Cannor, with the "Gommo", some sort of organisation of gnomish artificers. He views the concept of being sold into slavery as a delightful novelty that will allow him to investigate Vandiphan society, and offers to establish connections between us and the Gommo."
 #L62_prestigious_slave8:0 ""
 L62_labourers:0 "Brought before us in chains is no common chattel, but rather artisans of rare skill - architects who shape beauty into stone, engineers who command rivers to bend and the earth to yield. Their hands, calloused by labor, hold great precision; their gaze betrays a knowledge as grand as it is unyielding. Now, their expertise shall become the foundation of our grand designs, their sweat a tribute to the will of their superiors."
