 pactseeker_forest_goblin_with_a_little_help_from_my_friends_desc:0 "Governing is all about delegating. No one can do everything. The archfey, who we have made extensive pacts with in the past, rely on our warlocks to make their sometimes incomprehensible agendas a reality. The chain of delegation doesn’t stop there, though. As we may work for the archfey, other fey may work for us.\n\nOne example is the Aralez. These fey come in the shape of winged dogs and are exceptional at carrying mail and messages, all for a bit of consistent attention. Another common fey we work with are fairies. They can be difficult partners, but are excellent consequences for missed taxes. And we shouldn’t forget a favorite of all administrators, Dobies. Scarcely coming up to a goblin’s knees, Dobies will faithfully copy any text or writ given a pact for a warm hearth.\n\nSuffice to say, we’ve gotten very good at delegating. It’s no wonder that our clan functions smoother than so many others."

It is natural for others to assume that our clan’s actions are not just our own choosing, but also our patrons’. We’ve found this to be particularly useful during peace negotiations.\n\nMore than once, as we sat across from defeated foes carving out our rightful winnings, we’ve found the threat of invoking our patrons’ wrath to be enough to quiet any protests. After all, what’s the loss of one more province compared to the anger of the archfey?"
 pactseeker_forest_goblin_secrets_of_the_fey:0 "Secrets of the Fey"
 pactseeker_forest_goblin_secrets_of_the_fey_desc:0 "The ignorant believe that the Fey are bound to the Feyrealm. And fools assume that the only connection between Halann and the Feyrealm is the Deepwoods. We are neither ignorant nor foolish. \n\nGiven enough will and power, a fey can cross into our world. And, throughout not just Cannor but all of Halann, there are many portals tucked away connecting our plane and the Fey’s. Perfect for the Fey we have pacts with to cross through.\n\nFrom these crossings, these fey have seen many things. They’ve heard many whispers of knowledge. And sometimes they deign to share those with us."

But, I want to know why.”\n“Because long ago, the Fey betrayed the Goblins.”\n“For doing what?”\n“Nothing.”\n“That’s not a good reason!”\n“Does a beast need a reason to bite you?

Many in our clan are newly freed slaves from the wretched orcs. Unlike us, they come not from dark forests of the Deepwoods but rather from the deep caverns of the Serpentspine. \n\nWhile we do not regret saving them from orcish oppression, we cannot help but recognize they are a little strange. They don’t talk quite like us. They don’t look quite like us. And, they don’t think quite like us. The first one can be fixed. The second we will just have to ignore. But, the last one… it might prove valuable."
 old_ways_forest_goblins_from_the_fringes:0 "From the Fringes"
 old_ways_forest_goblins_from_the_fringes_desc:0 "Our clan is all too familiar with making more with less. Our ancestors, their ancestors, and THEIR ancestors spent their lives on the edges of the various groves that dot the Deepwoods. It was a poor place, little more than sticks, stones, and a whole lot of nasty creatures wanting to eat goblins. Despite this, the Forest Goblins endured and even thrived. The beasts that threatened us quickly learned our old adage - “Sticks and stones can break bones.”\n\nToday, our clan has a proper home and proper weapons. But that doesn’t mean we’ve forgotten how much can be done with less, and the tenacious spirit of our ancestors is still with us."

 old_ways_forest_goblins_clanboss_by_prowess_not_pact_desc:0 "Every goblin clan needs a clanboss. They need a goblin who ensures that a clan works together, with an iron fist as needed. Us forest goblins are no different. However, there are some that believe that a pact with a dirty fey is all you need to become clanboss. That a little bit of unearned magic will get you the clan’s respect.\n\nNot in our clan.\n\nOnly the strongest goblins, the smartest goblins, and the biggest goblins have the right to be clanboss. A clanboss must earn their position. And that means showing you’ve got what it takes."

For this reason it is important that if magic is used soil is given an appropriate recovery period where plants are allowed to grow without the assistance of magics.' -The Comprehensive Guide to Magicks\n\nThe laws of Magic are well written. This, however, does not mean they are respected.\n\nStarting in 1620, Eilísin began expanding their policy of mages assisting wine production, through the use of spells, in order to meet the growing demand for Eilísin Tríros, disregarding these well recorded laws of magic. To the despair of the rulers of Eilísin the increased usage of magic did not increased crop yields in the long term, seemingly having the opposite effect. In order to remedy this state mages, and even rulers, went down unnatural paths to restore the fertility of the soil and meet the ever-growing market, to keep the profits flowing.\n\nDuring the reign of Rewan IV there were many instances of bodies of plantation workers being found, their life force drained. While they were never linked to Rewan IV directly, these rumours proved too much for the Lorentish King at the time, who called for Rewan's execution and had his titles confiscated.\n\nRewan was never executed, disappearing on the day of his execution."

Imbued with new purpose Maugun set about catching the beast; stalking the Unicorn for a year before he caught it.\n\nBlessed with his new mount, and a refocused purpose, Maugun returned to his home of High Ording. He found it in flames. Without a moment's hesitation Maugun flew toward the besieged town, barely dodging a fireball, thrown his way by a marauding mage. Moving fast so as to avoid a second fireball Maugun sped toward the man, killing him in a single strike. Fortunately, the raiding force was a small one, and with the help of a few volunteers they were easily routed.\n\nIn the following year Maugun fought hard to defend his home. His valiant bravery made him popular with the locals, who coined the name "Maugun the Unicorn Knight", and later he befriended King Rewan Lorentis of Lorent, who granted him the Duchy of Great Ording. In all the centuries since, every Ordinger has aspired to his levels of bravery and devotion — and some even believe that if they can fully match him, a unicorn shall appear unto them as well."

Her father spurned him, saying he would need an entire mountain of gems to get a blessing for them to marry. Rubies, to match her hair and inner fire. Nothing else would be good enough for her. Meant to be an impossible task. He suffered many trials. Experienced joy and loss. Searched forgotten caves, fey touched woods, lonely mountains. Until he finally found it, his Ruby Mountain. With permission at long last, he and his beloved married and established a small colony over the mountain of rubies he had discovered. What would one day grow to become Rubyhold.

Human construction methods, how they conduct wars, fashions, how they order their societies; studies have been conducted on these topics and more. For Rubyhold the Institute has been an important way of keeping tabs on what humans are doing, with the added benefit of sometimes uncovering new ideas the dwarves had not considered.\n\nMost famously, it is here that the Lencori Plan was devised: the idea of creating a human nation out of the local tribes to act as a shield against external threats for Rubyhold.

Talented craftsdwarfs, ex-soldiers, and other professionals - our guides. Combined, they ensured that Rubyhold would be prepared, would not fall to any of the same tricks. Among the lessons learnt: having an outer set of gates, instead of just relying on the main gates of the hold for protection. These were named the Redgate and the Rivergate. Wrought and rewrought five times in our history in response to new lessons. The gates have stood up against the Ashen Skies, the Dragonswake, and foul sorceries.

Primarily found in the Ruby Mountains, the West Ruby mines are Rubyhold's main domestic source of gems. In the days before the old holds collapsed, the only gems that could be profitably exported to the Serpentspine. The distances involved in transporting them, combined with the relative scarcity, meant West Rubies have historically commanded a premium price.\n\nThe most famous West Ruby is disputed, most go to the Great Rose on the Ruby Crown of Lorent, which is ringed by five lesser rubies, collectively assembled to create a stylised rose. As a result, many Cannorians also refer to West Rubies as Rose Rubies.\n\nIn cultures further east that is not the case, West Rubies being associated with sunset, blood, or endings instead. The ancient crown, the Dwarovkron of the Dwarven Empire was said to have the largest West Ruby as its centrepiece, which was a late addition to the crown to mark the official recognition of Rubyhold as a hold equal to those underneath the Serpentspine. Such a controversial decision sparked the last great civil war of Aul-Dwarov, the War of the Bloody Gem, which to many was the final omen leading to the Last Days of the Dwarovar and the fall of dwarven civilization."

And the Lilac Wars roused some of our kindred to the aid of Lorent. A Damerian victory would have been a disaster, leaving us surrounded and eventually subsumed into the empire.

The discovery of new world gems in the colonies only increased the quantity of gems arriving in Rubyhold for cutting. During the 1600s ruby dwarves began setting up gem cartels, in many cases directly taking over the operation of mines in the new world. With long mining expertise, many countries were eager to accept the assistance of the cartels in their colonies. Those cartels funnelled gems of all shapes and sizes back to Rubyhold. Gems from Lorentish colonies arriving via Oldport and the Redgate, gems from imperial colonies arriving via Exwes and the Rivergate. It was said that more gems passed through the gates of Rubyhold in a year than existed in the treasuries of many countries."

During the chaos of the Jexisian Civil War the Chargers were nearly wiped out following a poorly chosen contract and faded into obscurity for a time, doing only minor work. It was not until 1252 that they re-established themselves under a new captain, signing a contract with the Marquis of Arbaran to serve in the ongoing Wars of Rule.

This practice dates to 1381 after Bella Derwing, aunt of the Count and diplomat-turned-teacher trained a group of troublemakers as diplomats for Derwing, to great success amidst the Lilac Wars' chaos.

Horrible miscalculations in an order for banners to decorate the walls resulted in far more banners than planned, which also happened to be almost as tall as the walls themselves. The lead designer of the renovation, Teagan of Freecestir, was struck with an idea upon seeing the behemoth banners; a way to not only incorporate them into the Castle, but to create a new array of defenses. Every section of wall was covered in banners, with very little space between them or the ground. Behind any banner could be a hidden door, a trap of some sort, additional arrow slits, or simply nothing. This method of design serves to confound and confuse any enemy army attempting to besiege Derwinger Castles."

Given little warning, the furious weavers of Wrothcross worked day and night to fulfill the order.\n\nUpon delivery of the order, it was found that the rapidly woven banners were of a higher quality than usual. The man in charge of the project, one Arnold Porter, took full credit. Upon learning of this, the weavers formed a vengeful mob and lynched him.

At a young age he learned forestry and hunting, and became one of the many young men who sought their future among the Alenic Woodsmen. But following some incident (the details are unclear) shortly after he turned 25, he was all-but-exiled from the land of his birth, and he headed east to find better fortunes in the foreign realm called Castanor.\n\nHe found a place tending to Castan V the Great's wolf-hounds, descendants of those raised by Castan II Beastbane. Though a lowly kennel assistant, he struck up a friendship with the Castan, whose favourite past-time was hunting with his canine companions, and deeply appreciated their beauty and vigor.\n\nWhen the Castan marched on the Alenic Frontier, Clothar accompanied him as assistant and retainer, and was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Legion II Vertesk. When the wars came to a conclusion, Castan the Great granted him a large swathe of land (including Derwing), elevating him as a 'civilized' and 'domesticated' Alenic.\n\nThe Lord Derwing, ruler of the Lower Alen under Castanor, would serve well for roughly two decades more, keeping his vassals at bay (though they despised him) and visiting Castanor every year or two to make personal reports to the Castan. But following his death to a bone cancer, many vassals refused to pay his successors any fealty whatsoever — they were denigrated as 'sons of a bitch, the lot of 'em' — and most lands beyond Derwing itself were lost.\n\nThis is our legacy, well-earned by service and never revoked from the family of Derwing. We shall make this truth clear to any and all pretenders."

Terr was under threat, and Petran certainly would not be safe if war did break out. And so, the regent sent Petran to spend his youth amongst the city folk of Esmarainé, the old capital of the disbanded Grand Duchy of Esmaria.\n\nAmongst the Esmarainé wealthy, and their extravagant parties, Petran would learn three skills that would serve him well for the rest of his days: how to drink, how to argue, and how to tell when someone was bluffing. With these experiences in tow, Petran would return home a skillful diplomat and would lead Terr through the harsh realities of imperial politics.\n\nWhen Petran's children came of age, he would send them off to Esmarainé as well to experience it just as he had. So, the tradition was passed on from one generation to the next: The Crimson Deluge, The League War, Camir's invasion — none of these stood in the way of this traditional ritual for Terr's scions."

Here, Lain would form "The Lady's Eagles", taking the old Alenic symbol of the eagle, and fought for Esmaria when it was invaded ten years later in 988 and in the Esmari resistance after that.\n\nHere, it was said, the Eagle banner could be seen flying high at the forefront of every battle and skirmish, and in the thickest of the fighting. Lain, for his honor and valiance in battle over the many years, would be awarded the county of Terr by the Duchess Lindelin of Esmaria.

Terr simply did not have a choice.\n\nNo sooner than had Lothane taken the throne, Terr was under threat. From the capital, Estallen lied just beyond the hills and was maneuvering for war. In the north, the hunters of Bennon wished to secure the Havoral Divide, and Terr's lands in Havorton lied in their way. To survive, Terr would have to act decisively. By playing off the bonds of the Rose party, it could keep itself out of harms way long enough to build a strong web of allies with itself at the center.\n\nLong after these threats subsided, Terr would still remember the victories the Rose party brought them during and after the war."

While this act put Terr at odds with their overlord, they would go on to side with the mages along with many other minor lords when the civil war would break out in 1253.\n\nMany years after the war, Terr's fondness of Aranthíl and the Magisterium has never waned. It is not uncommon, for the Counts of Terr open their court to any Magisterium Mage who needs a favor.

She wished not to ask the other lords for help lest they take advantage of Havorton's precarious situation and lay claim to the county to prevent the Havoric Kingdom from rising again, and so sought alliance with Warin, another lesser noble like her who happily accepted the countess's hand in marriage, bringing Havorton under Terr's rule.\n\nWarin marched confidently into Havorton with little heed of the enemy forces. What he assumed would be a ragged band of vagabonds turned out to be an army led by Henric the Fierce, a Havoric descendant gathering power to restore the kingdom, starting at its ancestral capital of Havorton. When all seemed lost, Warin picked up the fallen eagle banner and waved it high, reminding his men of the countless drills and battles that have been fought under it over the centuries, successfully driving Henric's men into the Esmar river and filling it with blood. By the end of the battle the Havoric restorationists were all slaughtered, and the eagle banner stood planted next to the river, the body of Henric limp beneath it."

Terrman diplomats often host eloquent parties along the banks of the spring, dipping jugs of cold water straight out of the spring itself, for Terr's diplomatic guests to compare to that of their Terrman wine."

However, these were little more than a host for the true treasure they attracted, the Terrman flower beetle. These Black beetles wandered from one flower to the next, chewing them clear of their petals.\n\nWhen the halfling, Isabella Brightflower, heard of the blooms deep in the Terr forests, she departed Viswall immediately with dye tools in tow. Brightflower set up a small lab on the edge of the forest and went to work. She found meager success, as each of the flowers produced too little pigment per petal to be an efficient dye. One day she came in and, to her horror, found her red flower petals had been eaten by dozens of bright red beetles. However, Brightflower recognized these beetles as the Terrman flower beetles, only they had turned a brilliant red, and then she had an idea. It turns out that the beetles turn the same color as the flowers they are fed, allowing for intricate and precise colors to be manufactured.\n\nBrightflower soon found herself in a storm of new dyes and colors. Unfortunately, the beetles never managed to survive the trip back to Viswall and so, Brightflower set up shop in Terr. While the dyes were never produced in the same quantities as they were in Viswall, the colors were still brilliant and easily distributed throughout Esmaria, bringing great wealth to Terr and her people."

The challenge spread to the Esmari river parties, where humans would line up to challenge the iron gullet of a dwarf. Some dwarves would accept multiple opponents at once to even the odds, with little change to the outcome.\n\nThe true show only really began when orcs challenged dwarves to the competition.

As the head of the project, he worked tirelessly and was able to make an early redesign of a rifle in 1523. It was fairly accurate for the time but would be too expensive for army-wide use. With this limited success, he went on to update the artillery batteries that Silverforge used, keeping them above the curve in comparison to their neighbors.\n\nStrongbellow would die in 1589 of natural causes and would be remembered in Silverforge for his dedication and ingenuity. In 1652, a university was built and named after him dedicated to Gunsmithing and Metallurgy."

Serving as a conduit for those disillusioned with Sun Elf rule across Baharšes, szel-Harrumaz coalesced his newfound followers from across a myriad of Old Sun Cult traditions into a single unified and fanatic force, the Šebhuliam, meaning green helmets in Bahari. This was  a militant sect dedicated to the sole purpose of ridding Bulwar of the Sun Elf yoke, just as it had thrown off that of the gnolls and the Djinn.

Whenever the political tide turned against Ovdal Tûngr, they could leverage these debts to ensure their advantage. This changed, however, with the arrival of Jaher and his elven legions. To ensure the loyalty of his conquests, Jaher banished all dwarves from his realm and forgave all debts they owned. In response, Odval Tûngr sided itself with the resurgent Castanor led by the Sorcerer-King.

This was not true for Ovdal Tûngr, however, sitting on their vast reserves of the metal mined from their mountain. Copper Bottoms as they are known among the humans were pivotal in the dwarven primacy along the Divenhal trade routes. These ships required less hull maintenance and lasted longer than their muscle encrusted competitors. And if the copper dwarves ever found themselves short on a trade investment, the sale of a few ships was enough to settle any debt."

With Hul-Jorkad and its pumping equipment as one of the first victims of the Last Days, the dwarves of the reclamation lacked the knowhow to undertake the massive pumping effort required to reclaim the lower levels of the hold. In 1491, however, a visiting dwarven inventor by the name of Grun Strongbellow would propose a new hydraulic system that could drain even the deepest of mines. Soon the dwarves were not only delving the depths of their lost mines, but were also sending exploratory expeditions off the coast of Bulwar in copper diving helms."

Only a century later would their full potential be discovered as a means to move the paddles of large ships. These "steamers” as they were called revolutionized water trade as ships could now more easily move upstream along the Suran to the ever expanding Jadd Empire and along the Alen to the burgeoning realms of Escann."

When the war turned sour he quickly joined the side of the League of Free Realms in 1006, and used his skill in river-fighting to help liberate the rest of Esmaria and push into Escann via the Alen river. After the war he was ordered to give the lands he occupied with his army back to the Esmarians but he refused, and used his River-Reavers to continue to dominate the riverways of the Esmar against his foes. Despite this, thanks to his companionship with the elf Saelihn he was a major force in the elvenization of the region."

The crystal was used to keep a simple transmutation spell that protected the silver from ever tarnishing.\nBut in 1440 Cristof was taken away from her far too soon, as he died during the Fourth Lilac War. When she found out about his unfortunate passing, she glanced at her ring. It was glowing as radiantly as it did the day it was made, not stained by a single smudge. At that moment, she realized that they were not connected in a mere union of a man and a woman. No. It was not only Reánna and Cristof who were united in wedlock.

The fact is, however, that no one in Madelaire knows for sure what happens to those who oppose us.

She had to beg, she had to plead, she had to demean herself so low. And for what? For a piece of land? She had to do all the things that Madaléin would never have done.

And just like that, orphaned us. We stayed alone even through Ellís's warmongering when we were pillaged and deflowered by the enemy armies, in the war that we never wanted.\n Ellís was quick to abandon us, quick to leave Wesdam widowed.\n A long, long time ago, Madaléin and Eilís had an older brother, Kylian. While the twins were both granted ducal titles, Kylian eventually became the king of Lorent. In 1582 Madelaire returned to the embrace of her older brother when it became a part of Lorent, still ruled by Kylian's descendants. There, we learned to love again.

Our ranks boast dwarves from every walk of life - no matter your birthplace, clan, or class. As much as the old dwarven clans that have persisted in the surface want to control our adventuring spirit - the reclamation of the Dwarovar somewhat mirrors the expulsion of our kin from the homeland so many years ago: it is a fresh start."

But the first two Fundamental Truths to life is that we all live in One World, and are created by One God, and so Varil did not stop there. By 1631, almost every Busilari ship engaged in the Kingdom's prodigious Sarhaly and Halessi trade would carry with it an array of new inventions along with a missionary who would use them to spread the teachings of the One God. In trading ports across Halann, in the wake of a Busilari trade fleet's visit, small communities of Ravelian adherents would undoubtedly spring up."

By 1441, all 86 packs of the Hillthrone gnolls had been subdued and united under her leadership, through war, diplomacy and marriage, thus becoming the first undisputed Queen-of-the-Hill in recent history.

The origins of the Proto-Exwesser people are largely unknown, though many think that we come from a strange tribe of peoples who thought, that the Deep Devil Onslaughts of Antiquity destroyed most of ancient civilization, that the safest place is at sea!\n\nIf this is true, our people have blood from all over Cannor, not just the Dameshead Sea but even as far as Bulwar, for our forebears would have traveled all over the Diven and Dameshead."

 A40_lilac_wars_crossroad_desc:0 "Exwes was located in the middle of the parties involved in the Lilac Wars, with many battles being fought around it and close to its borders. Despite this, Exwes tended to be avoided by enemy generals, for it was hard to supply armies in the area as its last were in a thin stretch of land between mountain and coast.\n\nThis problem was further compounded since, while Exwes might deny the fact, it was clear to both parties that Exwes didn't mind sheltering deserters. A popular anecdote from the time persists to this day saying that, 'Those who dare come through Exwes, may lose their stragglers, their hungry and their fearful to the Lilac Crossroads'."

 A40_the_rivergate_treaty_desc:0 "The Rivergate Treaty refers to a treaty made by the Duke of Exwes, Kylian Silcalas, with his cousin the King of Lorent, Reán Siloriel, at the start of the First Lilac War. With the major nobles of House Silcalas in Arbaran having joined the Moon Party, there was a lot of pressure on Kylian to follow suit. However, Kylian being cousins with the King of Lorent meant he held many Rose Party sympathies. This led to a meeting with the King of Lorent by the Rivergate to decide the role of Exwes in the upcoming conflict.\n\nHere, it was decided that it was better for Kylian to stay out of the conflict, to prevent the Silcalas family from installing a pretender. A compromise was reached with the neutrality of Exwes being guaranteed by the Rose Party and Exwes allowing military access to their members. With the Lilac Wars spiralling out of control with no end in sight, all consecutive rulers of Exwes have upheld the treaty to stay out of the conflict. Even after Arbaran switched sides in the Fourth Lilac War, Exwes remained neutral, despite the main reason for neutrality being gone. The wars at this point had proven far more trouble than they were worth."

 A40_open_to_all_desc:0 "The Silcalas came to rule Exwes in the mid-13th century when Alec Silcalas, second born of the then-emperor Varil Dovecastle, married the Duchess Marianne of Exwes. While seen as a minor title by the rest of the Silcalas dynasty, who had then ruled the Marquisate of Arbaran and now the Empire of Anbennar itself, Alec and Marianne's rule was one marked with tolerance. As a foreign dynasty in Exwes, Alec made sure to be relatively lax in enforcing Silcalas views on religious and political matters to appease the local population, and become more Exwesser and Arbarani during his rule.\n\nThis lax attitude came to shape Exwes as a nation shortly after the Corinite Proclamation, when many of the disenfranchised came to Exwes to escape the religious conflict regardless of whether they supported Adean or Corin."

However, these cloths are not used for clothing, but to produce high-quality sails."

While the land was filled with snow, the Ruby River that descended from the Ruby Mountains was unfrozen and glowed orange in the dawn. The orange glow allowed our forebears to instantly spot the fish in the river, allowing them to survive the winter. It is said that whenever a strong winter came our people returned to these lands, which led to them ultimately staying here.\n\nWhile this is merely a legend, it has been forever immortalized on our banners and coat of arms."

 A40_master_fishers_desc:0 "Exwesser fishers practice their trade from the Ruby River to the Dameshead Sea, and our expertise in fishing in both has led to us being the undisputed masters of fishing in all of Cannor. Our fishers' talent has led to all fishing guilds in the Dameshead hiring Exwessers to ensure they aren't driven out of business by our fishers, which has led to us dominating Dameshead's fishing industry in one way or the other, and for Exwes itself being the cheapest and most reliable producers of fish in the Empire. This, and our location near the Small Country and its plentiful produce, made us the number one trade partner for the ever-growing metropolis of Anbenncóst."

Upon finally returning home, she unified the Gerudian tribes of Konungrhavn, Sidaett and Revrhavn against the troll threat that had invaded their lands from the Dalrfjall.

This cycle of the death and rebirth of the world has gone for countless ages, and will continue for all eternity.\n\nIt is believed by some that Elkaesal, who slumbers in Gerudia, will one day awaken, and consume the world as Malliath did before him.

Under Adshaw Dinesck was nothing more than a mere momentary pause for dignitaries journeying to Bayvic. After Gawed turned its hungry eyes north but was solidly rebuffed by Bayvic in fierce fighting, they finally noticed Dinesck, saw the opportunity for a consolation prize, and the city wound up all-but-razed in a sacking by frustrated Gawedi soldiers. Even when goblins rose to power in so-called Bayvek, other Reachmen assumed the same must have happened in Dinesck.\n\nThis is an insult, but also an opportunity.

And when the Reach began to industrialize in the 17th century, the entire Alenic region suddenly hungered for wood to fuel the burgeoning furnaces and proto-factories.\n\nThis was invaluable for Dinesck as it recovered from the Gawedi sack; the city hired out logging teams across the Alen, while devouring more and more of the nearby woods itself. Under the Northern League, Dinesck was instrumental in felling vast swathes of forest fill the Magnates' coffers.

But more importantly, in Dinesck, Tola used the money to build a massive palace just outside the town. But the gentry of Dinesck had long disdained the city's lower classes, and would not relinquish their sneer when one suddenly ascended far beyond their assigned status. For all the palaces' lavish rooms and abundant ballrooms, they ignored any and all of Tola's invitations, not a one stepping foot in his 'Petty Palace'.\n\nTola would live and die in that building, and his fortune enriched two generations of descendants who did the same, before his grandson died without heirs. The Palace became used for two reasons: lumber storage, and impressing visitors who did not know its background.

Eventually, they were given citizenship and granted the right to vote in 1584. Over the years it became more and more common to see a goblin candidate in what was previously a human position, and in 1602, Reb of the Westflowers, an incredibly popular goblin born and bred in Bayvic, was elected to the most high office of Bayvic, or Bayvek as the goblins call it.

He did so by sacking the temple of Castellos on the Trialmount, which guards and administers the trials which decide the leader of Castanor, known as Castan.

That threat pushed the Gray Orc clans to unite faster and form Grombar, the Land of Gray People.\n\nOne of our new country's main policies was the destruction of orcish clans' importance in social life, tribal lands were revoked and tribesmen were settled in new cities, being forced to adapt to the new urban way of living.

The Syzirzexi kobolds have truly begun to believe themselves that they could be the children, the inheritors, of the dragons - and those who see them succeed are starting to believe it as well.

As the Crimson Deluge and the League Wars ravaged Cannor, hundreds of thousands fled their homes to the shining, peaceful beacon called Anbenland. Faced becoming a nation filled with hungry peasantry lacking skills or crafts, the government enacted a quota on refugees entering the country. Later known as the Great Sorrow, it prioritized those refugees with useful skills and established a new service that those without skills could join to earn access to the safety of Anbenland. These skill-less but motivated souls were organized into The Dule Legion, named after a flock of doves and in honour of their selfless service to the state and her people. These exiles served for 3 years, somberly risking their lives for the defense of Anbenland so that they might one day bask in her prosperity too."

Davan II saw an opportunity to be rid of this nuisance with the Greentide. The constant demands for supplies and funding to rebuild besoaked baronies, and intermittent rebellions from the lack of help, were too heavy a price to continue financing.\n\nJergan of Corveld, an eccentric but charismatic noble with dubious claims to the ruined city of Corveld, was summoned to Arca Corvur. Behind closed doors, the Raven Banner was established, outfitted with arms and supplies to drive deep into the Greentide.

Their zealous hearts fixated on the role of Corin as a defender of the weak and a slayer of evil.

Even the commoners tell tales of how their seditious neighbours or family members would be found dead and drained, displayed prominently in the town square.

So called because of the painted black hulls and crescent moon flags that they flew, the galleys of The Black Hulls were fast, maneuverable, and aggressive, favoring short engagements and boarding crews to extended exchanges of cannon fire.\n\nInvolved in privateering and smuggling contraband as well as military operations, there were few sights as beautiful and dreadful for the merchant ships and coastal settlements of the Divenhal as that of Nathalaire's navy under full sail - The ebony wood, dark as night, gliding effortlessly over the waves on dozens of agile oars, their prows pointed towards their next target of trade or plunder."

Considered by some to be an unsavory goddess for her association with criminals, there are few temples to Nathalyne anywhere - except in Nathalaire, where small shrines to the Shadowdancer are found in homes and alleys throughout the city. The Nathalairey are, by-and-large, outcasts and fortune seekers - the exact type of people who Nathalyne patronized in life, and continues to favor in death.\n\nWhispered prayers for safety, success, and fortune fall from the lips of lowly beggars, swarthy sailors, and crime bosses alike, all requesting aid from the Shadow Queen for their illicit dealings. Whether their skill as spies and thieves comes from Nathalyne's favor or the vast amount of practice that the Nathalairey get in espionage and deception is unknown, but none doubt the talents of the Nathalairey at intrigue."
 A74_the_maritime_guard:0 "The Maritime Guard"
 A74_the_maritime_guard_desc:0 "For most of its history, Nathalaire did not have an army, instead relying on the individual private military forces of powerful crime lords within the city to defend it in times of attack. While Nathalaire's isolation and many well-armed ships kept it safe from rampaging armies for decades, the years following the conclusion of the Lilac Wars saw major efforts by Eborthíl and Crathánor to conquer the city and end its smuggling and privateering in the Divenhal. To properly defend Nathalaire, in 1488 the Shadow Council created the Maritime Guard, the first proper state military in Nathalaire's history.\n\nConceived of as a force that could fight not only in defense of the city but also offensively on ships and islands throughout the Divenhal, the Maritime Guard was the brainchild of the great Smuggler Prince Sigmund sil Heartspier, and received most of its initial financing from his personal coffers. Originally composed of mercenaries and ruffians within sil Heartspier's employ, the Maritime Guard proved themselves in the 1490 Invasion of Gemisle, and would soon be filled with fighters in service to many of the crime families, all of whom saw involvement of their own forces as essential to curtail Heartspier's influence."

 A74_impressment_of_the_monstrous_desc:0 "Nathalaire's involvement in the green slave trade began almost as soon as the practice did. Slavery quickly became the single most important business in Nathalaire, and so many gnollish slavers flocked to the city to take part in the industry that Nathalaire's slave market was soon known by the gnollish name for it - 'The Krahzate.'\n\nNathalaire grew fabulously wealthy from the slave trade, becoming second only to Vertesk in the number of orcs it sold into bondage. The 1589 abolition of the slave trade in the Empire of Anbennar, however, led to a precipitous drop in the profitability of slaving. While operations continued for some time, the poor returns of the enterprise led Nathalairey slavers to turn their eyes towards other uses for their prisoners. Several naval captains noted that orc slaves could be put to use as rowers aboard galleys and as workers in the harbors, their great strength making them well suited for these tasks.\n\nOffered freedom if they completed 10 years of service, many orcs willingly chose to go to sea for the chance to escape bondage and proved themselves to be capable sailors. While the Smuggler Princes' prejudices often caused them to view the orcs as expendable, the "Monstrous Rowers" that they looked down on became indispensable for Nathalairey naval operations and defense in the mid 16th century."

Financed by the wealthiest individuals of the city, the festival features countless wonders, some of which can only be found here. While common delights such as fireworks and street performers abound, the greatest draw of the festival are its shadow puppet shows. Masters of the art of manipulating light, the shadow puppeteers of Nathalaire use beautifully designed paper figures in conjunction with intricate lighting, smoke, flame, and music to put on incredible performances of stories old and new.\n\nHosted at theatres around the city, these shadow plays are a sight to behold, the figures that the artists create moving in ways that some believe are too real to be simple tricks of the light. While some of these performances are open to the public, the shows of the most skilled puppeteers are exclusive events to which only the city elite and their guests are invited to, and much of the business of the Shadow Council is said to be discussed and agreed upon during the weeks of the Festival of Shadows."

Finally completed in 1689 after 21 years of construction, the Silnath Opera was considered a masterwork of architecture, combining elements of Neo-Damerian and Bulwari styles that gave it a unique and instantly recognizable look. Coldharbour's vast fortune was further invested in bringing skilled musicians, actors, and performers to teach and perform, and the Silnath Opera would become a major center of the arts throughout the 1700s and beyond."

Then they created a new institution, that of the Vault Magistrates. It was their job to carefully measure the quantities of gold in the vault and to always track the stores.

 I02_the_chain_bond_desc:0 "Krakdhûmvror is an ancient hold founded by the exiles and criminals of the Dwarven Empire. It has stood alone for centuries against many enemies, fighting near constantly to keep those who would destroy them at bay. This state of perpetual war gave rise to a unique culture amongst the dwarven holds, where sacrifice and skill were valued above bloodline, and the good of the hold was held above that of empire.\n\nThe outcasts of the empire gave more for the survival of their hold than any other dwarf in the Empire, be that by gold or blood. This attitude became known as 'The Chain Bond' amongst the people of Krakdhûmvror, a chain between each member of the hold from generation to generation forged in the frozen hardship of the north."
 I02_zaru_ubr_bloth:0 "'Zaru ubr Bloth'"
 I02_zaru_ubr_bloth_desc:0 "'Skill over Blood,' or 'Zaru ubr Bloth,' has long been something of an unofficial motto of the Krakdhûmvroric administration. As it was founded by exiles and criminals, Krakdhûmvror had very few strong clans in its early days. Instead of positions being determined by bloodlines or clans, Krakdhûmvror favors those with individual talent, which has resulted in a far less rigid hierarchy than most other holds. Even those of the most humble of upbringings can rise to the top, and nepotism is all but sacrilegious in the frozen halls of power.\n\nBecause of this, Krakdhûmvror has enjoyed an innovative and flexible administration for much of its existence. Many a time a disgraced scion of a royal clan fled to Krakdhûmvror demanding status and position, based on little more than their parentage, and all were told the same thing: 'Zaru ubr Bloth', Skill over Blood."

This is not without purpose; due to its origin as an expanded fort, every building in Krakdhûmvror is first and foremost dedicated to defence and survival. Even the smallest hovel is built to serve as a fortress unto itself. More than once, these fortifications stalled invading monsters long enough to save Krakdhûmvror from the destruction that befell all other holds in West Serpentspine, leading to a common Quartz Dwarf saying, 'Those in gold houses often end up dead.'"

More akin to Cannorian schools of magic than the runic magic dwarves usually practice, this unique type of cryomancy defies proper classification to any known branch of magic.\n\nThe exact details of Icecraft are a closely guarded secret, but it is known that the hold's namesake Frozen Forges channel the biting cold of the northern winds into a magical energy that allows the hold's Ice-Smiths to create Ice-Steel, a versatile metal imbued with the characteristics of ice and freezing water. From weapons that give enemies frostbite and arrows that shatter into shrapnel on impact, to armour that can 'unfreeze' and flow back together, the potential applications of Ice-Steel are widespread.\n\nWhile the production of the hold's signature steel has over the centuries declined, Ice-Steel armaments are nonetheless common enough that well-off soldiers have at least one weapon or piece of armour made of it, making the Frozenforge Hall's armies a glacial wall of unbending steel and death."

 I02_expansion_of_midjurdr_kralt_desc:0 "The modern hold of Krakdhûmvror has its roots in Verkal Midjurdr Kralt: Fortress of the World's End. Originally built to protect Dwarovar against the Ice Giants of yore and manned by exiles and criminals banished from the rest of Dwarovar, it became a derelict outpost after the giants' civilisation fell thousands of years ago and was eventually expanded to a hold. As the last outpost of Aul-Dwarov, isolated in the Giants Anvil mountains and disconnected from the Dwarovrod network, the only people who arrived to make a new life for themselves in the hold were those unwanted elsewhere in Dwarovar or those trying to escape their past. This led to the outpost developing a reputation for a solitary culture, and having very little interaction with the outside world.\n\nAt least, until the emergence of the orcs. As the holds of Western Serpentspine fell, refugees began to pour to the hold from Amldihr, Orlazam-az-dihr, and Dûr-Vazhatun, desperate for safety from the orcish menace. The rapid expansion of the hold's population forced the dwarves to work with what little resources they had to expand the hold's defences, living quarters, and infrastructure to accommodate a vastly larger population in a relatively short period of time. While this event took place ages ago, the dwarves of the Frozen Hold of Krakdhûmvror still retain the lessons of those days to this day, allowing them to easily integrate foreigners and expand the hold's infrastructure to account for the needs of the people."

It takes the most tenacious and determined people to work together in order to survive in as unforgiving an environment as Giant's Anvil, and centuries of hardships and struggle for survival have led to the dwarves of Krakdhûmvror becoming as unyielding as the quartz they get their name from. No matter what they might be up against, the Quartz Dwarves will face the odds with grizzled determination."

Debate rages, over whether they were a divine punishment for the greed and bickering that had weakened the hold, some strange beasts of the region rallied by Dûrkân the duplicitous, a con-man who cast himself in an image they saw as a god, or just a stroke of ill-fortune for miners who had dug too deeply and greedily.\n\nAll that can be said for certain is, in a single day, the enfeebled and unprepared hold was overrun. The accounts of that dreadful day, the marks it left upon the stones of our hold give us reason to fight all the harder, for the knowledge that all we've built could so quickly slip away."

Before the Hold's fall, up-and-coming alchemists made pilgrimages all across the Serpentspine to try their hand in turning it to gold, an ancient ambition said to have consumed our hold.\n\nEven now, dwarves are raised with the tale of Gulan-Amekh, the Golden King. As a young, starry-eyed man, the last king of Jorkad was said to have spent his life searching for the ritual in which he might turn our lead to gold. Soon enough, though, he was afflicted with the Hoardcurse, his goal discarded. Only his fixation on gold remained. It's long been said that Jorkad might have held, had he not embezzled and hoarded the funds that would've armed our soldiers on the fateful day of the hold's fall, or even that the orcs were sent as a punishment, for a greedy, unfit ruler whose lust for gold had spread to his people, fracturing the hold at every level."

While the meltwater from the peaks that has long fed the pipes of Jorkad was long sufficient to maintain us, the supply had nearly become insufficient. However, first simple water wheels along the river's run, and ultimately the towering machines that constitute the inner workings of the Jorkad Dam see enough water flowing into our hold to fill pipes from Jorkad to every stretch of the Serpentspine beyond, and power to turn the gears of each and every machine that springs from the minds of our engineers."

Once thought to be unimportant, at its fall, it became clear that Jorkad had served as the lynchpin of dwarven civilization, the holds of our people laying as divided as the ranges of the Serpentspine that were cleaved to pieces by its fall. The few remnants of Aul-Dwarov pointed fingers and squabbled until the bitter end, as the orcs swept across the enfeebled holds. Now knowing our status as the junction, the linchpin of all the Serpentspine, the new Jorkad will set the terms of trade through the Serpentspine, goods ebbing and flowing like the water in our pipes."

Dropping through our shot towers, flowing through the instruments of our alchemists, in our pipes, safely divided from the water by a thin barrier as they convey some of Halann's most safe and desirable water.\n\nThrough purifying our usage of it, just as lead burns away its impurities, and finding safer, more efficacious uses for our most abundant resource, we have created one of the most enviably modern holds in all the Serpentspine, shown ourselves as a leader among all the world's peoples. Bright folk envy the lead-lined lives of Jorkad's dwarves. Wise ones know our pipes aren't."

Eventually, during the Age of Artificers, they discovered they could use mirrors and glass to concentrate the power of damestear into a powerful beam of light capable of cutting and even burning. This led to a revolution in technology for the hold, and by the 1900s, would create weapons of mass destruction."

For one reason or another, if a hold deemed something, or in rare cases someone, too dangerous, it was sent to Gor Vazumbrog, locked away in a Titanium Vault of its own unique design, watched over by the hold's guardians until the bitter end.

It would be here, for millennia, that the Titanium Dwarves ensured that no large orc incursion touched the Middle Dwarovar or the Tree of Stone. Whilst over time stragglers would find their way past, it was never in large enough numbers to become a catastrophic threat that risked overwhelming the Middle Dwarovar in a way as to what occurred in the west.

The rite of initiation was to kill a great beast of the depths, for what is a goblin or orc to the terrors of a Purple Worm or some other horror from below? As years went on, and supply lines became restricted, the Dauvek Veker would become renowned weaponsmiths alongside famed monster hunters, venturing places in search of materials and reagents to create enchanted magical weapons - greatest of all their curved sabres, the most famous of which was wielded by Krummul Orcslayer."

His life would not stop being of note there, in time earning the name "Orcslayer" for his actions of single-handedly slaying an entire orc warband over the course of a month, before it could gather the strength to assault the walls of Gor Vazumbrog. Over the course of his life, Krummul Orcslayer would put his experiences and thoughts into words and compile a comprehensive list of grudges and wrongdoings done to dwarvenkind by its enemies over the millennia, aptly named "Krummul Orcslayer's Book of Dwarven Grudges."

The Hunter of the Deep, a massive dragon of deepest purple that came up into the hold from the deepest levels, killing all who stood in its path. The beast had killed tens of thousands before the order to abandon the lower levels was given, and efforts of an evacuation began in the higher levels. Making use of the hold's Titanium Guardians to slow the Hunter of the Deep, every other available hand was to see to the evacuations.

When the Phoenix Empress Jexis occupied and turned Seghdihr into a puppet in 1139 it eroded the unity of the Segbandal even furhter, who had already lost Gor Vazumbrog during the Dragonwake was shaken to its core. In appeasing their foreign Phoenix overlord, pleas from Gor Ozumbrog against the oncoming tides of goblins and orcs were ignored, delayed, or refused by both Seghdihr and the rest of the Segbandal like Verkal Gulan and Hehodovar.\n\nInstead, Gor Ozumbrog broke with the Segbandal and attempted to unite with the hold of Ovdal Kanzad to its east, for the aid that could be provided to each other was undeniable if they were to secure the Tree of Stone. Alas, this was not to pass. Whilst the majority of the Ozumbroger army, led by King Ombrindal the Stout, rallied and aided to the defense of Ovdal Kanzad against the goblin hordes, the armies of what was left of the Segbandal were mustered and sacked Gor Ozumbrog in spite. In the end, King Ombrindal was forced to withdraw to protect the hold, sealing the Tree of Stone to its fate, and most importantly failing in Gor Ozumbrog's vow to uphold its name as the "Eastern Hold That Bridges Mountains".\n\nThis ancient shame could not be righted in their time, so let us ensure that the spirits of those ancestors know that we have taken that mantle, and continue to guard the passage from the Tree of Stone to the rest of the Dwarovar."

Lasting for over a decade, there was little the damaged hold could do in the end to withstand the onslaught. It was only a matter of time when the outer reaches of the hold fell. Disaster turned to devastation as an orc warband, fresh from the west, arrived and threw themselves against the hold's remaining defenses in an attempt to seize the last riches of the hold for themselves.\n\nSurviving legends say that King Ombrindal alone held the remains of the main gate to the inner hold for over 23 days, long after the last of his personal guard had fallen - refusing the cries of the gate's defenders for him to fall behind the gate to safety. The last two of those days were said to be spent half-dying atop a mountain of goblin and orc corpses, but he granted innumerable soldiers... and civilians the chance to flee, and at the very least have a chance of making it to another hold.\n\nWhilst his sacrifice was in the end almost certainly in vain with his people almost certainly dying in the depths of the Dwarovar, the lessons imparted from it are a reminder that we fight for things greater than ourselves, and that even hundreds of years after our own deaths, we may be remembered for deeds that seemed inconsequential today."

Once, of course, we reclaim or replace the stolen topaz that will adorn it. Regardless, with this as our seat, we shall let the world know the might of Gor Ozumbrog!"

In the streets of Elynayle can be found elves from all nine of the great clans, drawn to the lakeshore for rare trade goods, tranquil relaxation beneath open skies, or reconnection with the maritime traditions of their ancestors.\n\nWhen the orcs of the Greentide came upon the Deepwoods and threatened to destroy the Wood Elven Clans, Salla Elyn took the lead in coordinating a united effort to oppose the invaders. Drawing on their many connections to the other clans, they called a council in Elynayle, to which Clan Myna and the precocious young queen Narawen of the Drennen responded.

The search for beasts to slay lasts for an entire week, with the group taking the most prestigious kill being proclaimed the greatest hunters of the year, along with a large sack of crowns."

This forced us to abandon our steeds, and rely instead on an army of primarily infantry. But recently, after years of experiments, horse breeders, with a degree of magical aid, have finally bred a horse suited to Effelai's climate. One that can move quickly, is light yet strong, fast, and most importantly, is well adapted to the heat and insects, with short manes and thick, porous skin.\n\nUnfortunately, this horse can't be used for devastating charges like in Cannor, as it is quite small, and the terrain is very unsuited for charging, but it makes for an excellent pack animal, as well as a useful steed for scouts."

They are inhabited by fiercely independent pioneers known as the Swampmen. These men are known for their respect of the nature around them, their reputation as some of the best hunters in Aelantir, and their bravery. Though it is difficult at best to enact any sort of governance on these townships, or levy taxes, they still respect our nation, and in exchange for their guaranteed autonomy, join ranks with our traditional forces in times of war, providing us with exceptional scouts and skirmishers."

Our founders know this too, and that is why in 1556 the Order of the Crab was founded, named for the giant red crabs found on Red Isle. This unique order of sailor-knights manage and command our warships, and are famed for their aggressive boarding actions, turning what was a regular naval engagement into a close-quarters melee. Spurred on by their honor as knights, the Knights of the Crab bravely charge onto the enemy deck in their half-plate armor, rapier in one hand and pistol in the other."

Those before us sang to appease the jungle, and advised us to do the same. But the Knights of Núr Dhánaenn are no cowards, no appeasement shall we make! For as we charge into battle, let it be known we sing not with or to appease the jungle, but against it, to drown out its siren calls! Let the jungle call, for we cannot hear it over songs of the bravery of the Knights Magnificent!"

After he retired in 1578, he bought the land with his earnings as an adventurer, purchased some orcish laborers, and established a plantation. The high quality fruits Alain's plantation produced immediately made him rich, allowing him to buy another plantation and grow his oranges there, then another one, and another one. By 1745, Alain and Sons' produced half of the oranges sold in Aelantir, and oranges became one of Núr Dhánaenn's most famous exports."

Many of the peoples who borders the Deepwoods still have folk stories warning children that if they misbehave then the fey-folk will steal them away in their sleep.

His clan sacked Bladekeep and the dreadful howls they performed during the pillage had given them their name. The Blackmoon Clan on the other side was famous for their battle shamans, who unleashed their magical power on the armies of humans and dwarves. The Silentblade Clan was considered somewhat dishonorable by other orcs, but they excelled in guerrilla combat, using ambushes to defeat their foes.

All these gifts were given to help orcs crush the human and orc realms in Cannor and plant a new Deepwoods in their place.

With their backs to the cliffs it was clear to the Boek that there would be no surrender, and they fought with a previously unseen ferocity. The Braves, living up to their name, charged, with disregard for their own lives, headlong into the Cannorian muskets. Refusing to give up what little they had left the Braves pushed on through the gunfire, with each Brave taking as many as 6 shots to bring down.\n\nBut it was not enough; no amount of bravery could make up for the technological disparity between the settlers and the Boek and they were slaughtered to the last.\n\nIn the end it seems the Lenef were proven correct: there is more to war than mere bravery.“ – Excerpt from The Last Stand of the Braves."

While this practice may seem unnatural to our peers, and even to some within our own tribe, this innovative design serves a very practical purpose: by building within the trees the Yan tribe is better able to make use of the space within the forest and protects the tribe from the monsters that prowl the forest floor."

Capable of killing a brave with a single swipe a small pack of Bloodfeeders can certainly present a serious threat to an unprepared force.

As our tribe grows however the prospect of moving our entire tribe becomes a daunting one, and so have been forced to adapt. Rather than fleeing from the Bloodfrenzy, we will fight it, but on our terms.

Soon, though, our scouts found the source of this great terror. Strange folk so much like ourselves, yet so different. They cut down our scouts with the same emotionless precision as they offered the Bloodfeeders.\n\nSo it was for years, that we skirmished with these 'elves'. Though we could scarcely capture them, for the ferocity they offered, what little we could gleam was that they wished to kill all who walk upon the world, save for their own kin. So it was, for a time, our dwellings pushed from the forest that was our home, our trees aflame as we found ourselves set against this great enemy.\n\nBut we were not alone in our fight. A strange short-eared folk followed who too came from across the seas but were embroiled in battle with the elves. Whilst at first we had distrusted these people it became clear we could not stand alone and our braves joined with theirs becoming their brothers in battle, standing at our side, along with many others.

Furthermore many members of our tribe have been found alive but with two puncture marks on their neck, but with no memory of the night before.\n\nA thorough investigation by our priests and braves lead us to the answer to this mystery. With the settlers came a new breed of Bloodfeeder, one capable of disguising itself as a person, tricking our people into following them away from the tribe where they are drained of blood.\n\nOur braves have become adept at hunting and killing these creatures. Unlike their Bloodfeeder brethren they are vulnerable to sunlight and bound to a single location that, once destroyed, can eliminate the creature permanently.

These braves came to be known as the heaven's fury and thanks to their great prowess we were, with the assistance of tribes from across the seas, able to push the demons out of our lands and back to the very sea that spawned them."

Using corn harvested from their fields Tehanek made what is known as “fire corn", throwing corn into a fire the corn would cause the kernels to quickly dry and pop off the cob and out of the fire, where it must be caught and finally eaten. Fire corn proved very popular with the Cannorian settlers, who brought many ingredients that could be added, whether sweet or savoury and they were keen to trade these ingredients with our tribespeople, in exchange for knowledge on how to make fire corn, and other foods made from three sisters crops."

He looked around for tracks; they weren't hard to find. They were headed North, towards the tribe, and judging by the stench of gunpowder left in the campsite they didn't have the peaceful intentions.\n\nHe caught up to them but a few hours later. Just as he'd suspected, a party of 20 of them, armed to the teeth headed straight towards Tehanek, they'd reach the tribe before sundown at this pace. Of course they'd not maintain this pace for much longer, or any pace for that matter. He silently dropped from the trees, simultaneously throwing a tomahawk at the nearest soldier and using his magic to ensnare another. The Cannorians were easily panicked, unsure where he was lurking they fired their muskets aimlessly into the bushes.\n\nIt was all over in a matter of minutes. All 20 of them slain, all 20 of them victims of the red eagle, victims of the Hewehr'ittaro."

After spending several hours in the shaman's hut Andrel emerged somewhat dazed, and informed his entourage of the bargain he had struck: Cestirmark was to recognize the Tehanek claim to a vast region of the Trollsbay and in exchange? Cestirmark would be granted a wooden flute.\n\nUpon his return Andrel was promptly fired."

A small force of our Braves awaited them, weapons at the ready. They marched to face us, and found themselves sinking, having walked into a concealed bog. But they pressed on, towards the mound where our warrior awaited them, their fate sealed.\n\nThe signal was given.\n\nOur warriors arose from the depths where they had concealed themselves.

Inspired by this legend, and aided by a foreigner named Adrien síl Terr, a group of Braves from our tribe gathered to make the fabled journey once more, seeking to learn about the people who live there and gain their aid in expanding our tribe.\n\nAt first it seemed they feared us, believing us to be some form of demons, and were cautious with their words, telling us little of their tribe and the other tribes of the river. That changed when we told them of the vast ocean beyond the cliffs astonished they lead our expedition to the local chief Seronval asking endless questions about the bay and yet strangely disregarding our warnings.\n\nUpon our arrival their chief granted our tribe many gifts, most notable of all was the necklace granted to Tewalari, our chief, before his departure, and its striking resemblance to the artifact granted to us by the heavens.

 G42_ynnsmouth_settlement:0 "Ynnsmouth Settlement"
 G42_ynnsmouth_settlement_desc:0 "Whilst the Inek had nominally settled Ynnsmouth, the settlement was never a large one, likely due to the Inek's fear of the seas, and the Kuukuswlaws lurking in the bay. The Cannorians had no such fears and were more than happy to settle along the coast, however none settled Ynnsmouth, likely due to both the Inek Braves who would attack any colonists and a deeper, instinctive, feeling that Ynnsmouth should be avoided.\n\nThe first permanent Cannorian settlement in Ynnsmouth was founded as late as 1673 by a small group of settlers from Busilar, having fled the country due to conflicts over the continued worship of certain Regent Court deities by the populace. Following the foundation of this settlement the Inek found themselves drawn towards the coast, expanding the Inek settlement and eventually absorbing the Busilari settlement. Ynnsmouth grew to become a major trading hub due its prime position at the mouth of the Ynn. Most traders do not stay for long."

Even still, they were not properly integrated into the government of Ameion. This changed with the ascension of Kelindas to kingship, with the Klereyen as his most loyal followers. He rewarded them by putting them in the highest levels of administration and favoring them as such. In every part of the empire of Nákyra, the Klereyen can be found, a policy continued by Kelindas's successors, who saw the Klereyen as their most loyal base of support."

While many among them are too disheartened to continue resistance, many more refuse to acknowledge, and actively resist the truth: the blood of Laskaris are the rulers of these lands. The lingering resentment and occasional rebellion against the monarchy has led to the need to create a new force designed specifically to combat this ever present threat: The Krypharpedan.\n\nRecruited from amongst the most loyal of Klereyen, they actively hunt the republican resistance. Especially active in the Devand and in the kheions, they are the shield that keeps the royal familly, and Nákyra as a whole, safe from both domestic and foreign attack."

 hobgoblin_forging_an_empire_desc:0 "In the aftermath of our invasion of northern Rahen, we had to quickly adapt our administration to accommodate the new territories. Many local leaders organised resistance against our rule, which weakened our control over the conquered lands. In response we hunted them down and executed them. We ensured that they were replaced with weaker willed locals. These meek rulers would lead by example. Under the watchful eye of hobgoblin garrisons they greatly weakened any resistance to our rule. It was through these strict measures that newly conquered peoples and lands could be quickly incorporated into our Great Command as we marched upon Haless."
 hobgoblin_modern_drill_techniques:0 "Modern Drill Techniques"
 hobgoblin_modern_drill_techniques_desc:0 "Through many generations we have developed traditional techniques of drilling our armies. While these techniques had been adequate for border protection and the conquest of the Jade Mines, our expansion into northern Haless introduced us to several new enemies. This kick-started the development of modernised drills. The two main drills were those developed by the Wolf Command, which centered around cavalry flanking maneuvers, and those developed by the Boar command, which centered around massed infantry. The latter of the two would prove a very effective baseline for later firearm drills."
 hobgoblin_warforged_culture:0 "Warforged Society"
 hobgoblin_warforged_culture_desc:0 "Constant warfare both within and outside of the Jade Mines has pushed hobgoblin society into ever greater centralisation and militarisation in the form of various Commands, culminating in the founding of the Great Command in 1391 AA. This has led to hobgoblin society becoming an incredibly well oiled machine capable of supplying vast armies with extreme efficiency, with almost every household capable of producing weapons, uniforms and soldiers for the Great Command’s endless campaigns. This has resulted in a civil society that is completely integrated into the purpose of the state: War."

 hobgoblin_honourable_service_desc:0 "Honour is a core pillar of our culture. And honour is kept through loyalty. No good hobgoblin would even consider betraying their duty to their family and Command and lose their honour. A hobgoblin without honour loses their family, their position, their very place in society. They are removed from all the things that give meaning to life and thus often end up with two options, suicide or exile. Suicide is the preffered choice for those who have dishonoured themselves, for such is the weight of our honour. No secrets are spilled."

 hobgoblin_expanded_ninyu_kikun_desc:0 "As the armies of the Wolf, Boar and Lion grew in size and strength various Grand Marshals of the Great Command sought to expand the forces directly controlled by them beyond the enslaved Zanyu Kikun. This led to the creation and steady expansion of the Ninyu Kikun, the combined army, which answered only to the Grand Marshal. This force would systematically recruit the most disciplined soldiers and most accomplished commanders into the service of the Grand Marshal, eventually forming the most formidable army of the Command. The Ninyu Kikun would be the first of the armies to adopt artillery into their formations, crushing enemy defences and opposition while paving the way for the artillery innovations of the Dragon Command. The existence of the Ninyu Kikun also served to increase the authority and control of the Grand Marshal within the military structures of the Command and by extension their authority over the lesser Marshals."

 hobgoblin_military_education_desc:0 "Hobgoblin military education begins in the family, with grandfathers and fathers beginning the process of passing down their martial skills to their sons from the age of 8. Years of training from a young age form the foundation that a young hobgoblin builds upon through their introduction into larger military divisions, such as a senun, banner, or ten, regiment. It is here that a hobgoblin has the opportunity to distinguish themselves on the battlefield, potentially earning an exaltation from a superior officer. A hobgoblin soldier who earns themselves an exaltation is given an advanced military education and promoted to captain, regardless of their clan’s status. The system of exaltations ensures that the officer corps of the Command has greater pools of talents to draw upon than most states on Halann and prevents the elite clans from monopolising leadership positions."
 hobgoblin_direct_control:0 "The Six Command System"
 hobgoblin_direct_control_desc:0 "Our expansion outside of Shamakhad began to strain the administration due to the lack of loyal and honourable hobgoblins to govern our newly conquered lands. This led to our Grand Marshal dividing the three original Commands into the Tiger, Elephant and Dragon commands, who would found war camps and settle in the lands outside of Shamakhad. The influx of our people into the distant territories allowed for the expansion and spread of hobgoblin garrisons, easing the pressure on our central administration and ensuring that our Great Command could govern the dishonourable peoples of Haless with greater efficiency than before."

While under gnollish rule, this art was mostly lost, and it didn't regain much of its former glory while under the sun elves. In Dartaxâgerdim, the old art was revived and an arcane society rose to prominence and now flourishes all over Bulwar."

Though training to use the Chakram is difficult, its unusual mechanics make it useable by both infantry and cavalry and makes our forces effective at inflicting great casualties on the enemy before we engage in close combat.

Only strength will save her, the strength of unity and wisdom, and that is a strength Babhagma has. At this time of crisis we are reminded of the poetic works of the great Harimari poet and former Senapti of Babhagama, Kobidran. Among his most famous works, the poem that would become known as The Flower Oath began 'On the day when the lotus bloomed, alas, my mind was straying, and I knew it not. Only now and again a sadness fell upon me, and I started up from my dream and felt a sweet trace of a strange fragrance in the south wind. That vague sweetness made my heart ache with longing and it seemed to me that is was the eager breath of the summer seeking for its completion.'\n\nMany see a message of a changing season where destined conclusions come to pass in these words, and find them deeply relevant to modern times. We agree - and we will embody this longing, ambition, and surety as we reaffirm the oath that gave our ruling dynasty its name. Under our firm paw we will bring the peace and serenity of the lotus blossom to Rahen by any means necessary."

Though it has fallen into disrepair in recent years due to the conflict raging in northern Rahen, the Sojourner's Road and Tilathi remain sacred places of great beauty worthy of restoration and protection.

While this decree was unquestioned by many in South Rahen, in Tiltaghar the distance from the centers of political gravity meant that the reform never took as firm of a hold.\n\nThroughout the history of the Northern Senapti, humans proved their valor, skill, and intelligence, and the attitudes of the harimari rulers of Tiltaghar changed to become far more accepting of working with, instead of ruling over, humans over the years. This culminated in the 1601 Edict of Tiltaghar, issued shortly after the collapse of the Dhenijanraj's central authority, and decreed that the highest castes would no longer be forbidden to humans, who would henceforth be equal partners in the land of the Tiger Ziggurat."

Though many feared that the newborn and still fragile Raj would be torn asunder without a capable hand guiding the ship of state, such fears proved to be unfounded. The late Raja’s principle advisor, Goshar of the Golden Paw, Prabhi of Amtujsaat, stepped in as regent to the infant prince and served as de-facto ruler of the Raj for 23 years, raising the prince to be a capable ruler and handing power to him when Shurapalar turned 25.\n\nIn his stewardship of the state, Grand Vizier Goshar was known for his masterful and gentle hand, convincing many to follow the throne with perfectly selected arguments and, when those failed, political assassinations, rather than open warfare.

It is estimated that 100,000 soldiers and a quarter million civilians died over the course of the struggle, and the legitimacy of the throne in Dhenijansar was badly degraded. Worse still, 25 years of civil war had allowed the armies of the Jaddari to gain a foothold on the Southwestern Coast, The Command to cross the Kharunyana and seize Pordhatti and Sarnavan, and Bhuvauri to invade the Ascension Peninsula and topple the Senapti of Rabaghekhur.

As the Jaddari armies advanced, many of the prabhi surrendered and swore fealty to the Desert Elves directly, and soon a large swathe of lower Rahen was controlled by the invaders.\n\nAfter failing to halt the advance of the Jaddite Army at Rhamirta, the reeling lords of Amtujsaat turned to their southern neighbor, the Senapti of Tujgal, for protection. Offering their fealty to the White Tiger of the Jungles in exchange for protection, Amtujsaat and their fellow prabhi of Umdaj and Parus Panasur became vassals of Tujgal, who proclaimed the formation of a new realm, separate from the old Raj and based in the unified and centralized jungles of the Ascension Peninsula - the Kingdom of Vanrahar."

Despite our internal diplomatic struggles, the Radiant Sun is also strong in the great mercantile republic of Bhuvauri to the East, and we have cultivated many commercial contacts there.\n\nTheir mercantile bent and knack for a good deal has rubbed off on many of those merchants who have regular contact with the slave-princes, and we find our traders growing more skilled by the day.

But our adherence to the Radiant Sun school of High Philosophy had made the message of the Jadd particularly compelling to our Senapti and many of our warriors, and the ever-ambitious lords of Rabhidaraj sensed an opportunity. Secret talks were initiated with the Jaddari, via Bhuvauri liaisons, to betray the Raja and join our realm to theirs - in return, we would convert to the Jadd and join them as equal partners in empire.\n\nWhen the forces of the Dhenijanraj met the Jaddari at the Battle of Ghamakrit, the Rabhidaraji held the right flank as always - but at a critical moment in the battle, we withdrew and exposed the Raja's center, allowing them to be crushed by the Jaddari cavalry. With the army broken, we marched alongside the Jaddari to the gates of Dhenijansar and threw down the walls for our new brothers in the faith. Thus, by the treason of Rabhidaraj did the Jaddari gain their dominance over lower Rahen - and we obtained our central place as governors and administrators in their growing realm, sculpting policy from within as willing partners instead of subjugated serfs."

Because of this, in the months and years that would follow the fall of the Jadd Empire, Rabhidaraj would establish itself as a power player in the emerging Deioderan polities that would dominate Rahen for the next half-century."

As one of only a few places where one can easily cross from Bomdan into Rahen, this site holds critical importance to the Raj, and it has long been the duty of the Senapti of the East to hold this crossing against all foreign incursions - and to be ready to sally forth and lead the armies of the Raja across the river against the kingdoms of the Bom."

In many ways, the waiting came to be more important than Maharaaja itself - for while the plains would eventually be reclaimed, fought over, and lost again in the 1600s, the patient and poised planning of the standoff would come to characterise the Rasarhid people of Endhuvi.

Rather than hold in the capital as his fellow lords had done, Senapti Ghirakur of the Shadow Claw abandoned the city and brought 7000 of his best fighters into the dense jungle of Darasar to wage a guerrila war against the hobgoblins.\n\nIn a military campaign that would come to be known as 'The Darasar Rearguard', Senapti Ghirakur and his 7000 clashed with the forces of The Command in brutal jungle warfare and lightning raids, disrupting lines of supply and communication before fading away into the wild thickets.

As folk ran for cover, something remarkable happened - an enormous white catfish leapt from the water, its scales glittering every color of the rainbow, its presence seeming to warp light around it. For a time it swam languidly in the shoals of Endhuvi, and the people flocked to the shore to get a glimpse of the vast magical creature. The spirit fish would eventually disappear into the vastness of the river-sea, but returned to the shallows of Endhuvi often.

When members of the court began to engage the eastern prince about philosophy they found his exotic views to be intriguing, and a small following of the Ascendent Soul began to grow up surrounding Ramnath.\n\nWhen plague struck Keyattordha in 1443, it claimed Ramnath's wife and brother-in-law, who left behind no heirs. The only surviving member of the Bloody Claw family was Ramnath’s infant daughter Shushuri, leaving the city without a leader during a major crisis. The people turned to Ramnath, who readily stepped into power to help his suffering city. Ramnath would rule Keyattordha for his daughter until his death in 1465, whereupon the throne passed to Shushuri and her husband Mahipalar of the Flower Oath, Senapti of Babhagama."

By the time he returned to the land of his birth, he has been completely forgotten, but his wisdom earns him the status of king that he once so feared and loathed.\n\nThe Gharabhatithura is celebrated for its inventive use of meter, riveting and occasionally comical story, and portrayal of ancient Haless at the time of the Oracle Kings."

Cannorian diplomats made multiple offers of wealth and knowledge if Keyattordha or her sister cities would surrender their porcelain manufacturing methods, but all refused.\n\nWhen diplomacy failed, the Cannorians turned to espionage, attempting to steal the secret of porcelain making. In 1699, the Lorentish diplomat Celador Rosebloom was arrested in Keyattordha and accused of porcelain espionage. He was found guilty and executed despite formal protests from the Lorentish government. Seeking revenge for the diplomat's death, a cabal of Cannorian merchants and government officials struck a deal with Bhuvauri, bribing them with exclusive trade rights, new-model cannorian cannons, and a vast sum of silver in exchange for humbling the porcelain cities\n\n. One night in 1699, on secret orders from Sramaya, the slave-soldiers of Keyattordha’s garrison mutinied and sacked the city, destroying its porcelain workshops. Other porcelain cities suffered similar fates in the so-called 'Typhoon of Broken Vases', leading to great resentment towards the city and its inhabitants from the other porcelain cities in later years."

Though outnumbered and with little hope of relief, the brave warriors of Pordhatti fought the invaders both on the high cliffs above and in the rushing river of the gorge itself.\n\nFor three days the Hobgoblins were held at bay, the terrain minimizing their advantages in numbers and tactics.

If one was competent and obeyed the strict laws of The Command, they could rise high in the bureaucracy or auxiliary military forces of the state, regardless of their race. This offered a much higher degree of social mobility than many Raheni had ever experienced before, and as a result the level of resistance to the occupiers was much lower than outside observers expected.\n\nAs the years went on, and the occupying hobgoblins permanently established control over the upper Kharunyana, they left their mark upon the cultural mores of the human population under their control. Military discipline, honor, and community became ever more important, reshaping the society into what the hobgoblins called the Wuhyun, though the people of upper Rahen had their own name for this culture - the Navanyodhi, the New Warriors."

The rebellion was initially very successful, and while the lords of Amtujsaat defeated one of the peasant armies, the rebels succeeded in capturing Sardiphadin in 1559.\n\nThis crisis within their own borders forced the Raja to abandon the defensive fortifications at Shenral to deal with the crisis, pulling their armies back and capturing Sardiphadin from the rebels after a 4 month siege. This time away from the borders allowed the Jaddari to advance through the Bloody Pass and put Rayavashapal to siege, the City of Endless Debate falling in early 1560.\n\nWith the lordship of Pasiragha lost, the Raja was forced to appoint a new Senapti to assist them with the war, and careful political maneuvering by Ghundaghar saw them achieve their long awaited goal of becoming Senapti.

Instead of old customs, many young officers and thinkers began calling for a new realm, a complete break with the old system of rajas, prabhi, and senapti, with only one centralized government. This concept, called Vanrahar or "Jungle Paradise", aimed to see our home remade stronger and purer than ever before, no longer divided arbitrarily but instead foremost among the nations of Haless.

Originally little more than a small country villa, the triplet sisters transformed the remote palace into a place of luxury and high society, known for its tranquiline halls and well-kept grounds.\n\nCo-ruling as equals, the Lotus Princesses, as they were called, used their growing power to cultivate peaceful coexistence between the harimari and humans of the floating cities, ensuring that resentment of the harimari from their recently conquered subjects never flared up in the region. Their efforts also succeeded in binding many of the high caste families of lower Rahen together in marriage treaties, ensuring calm cooperation and familial geniality beneath the hegemony of the Raj. To this day, Parusad Bhola is known as a peacemaker among the lordships of the Harimraj, its officials preferring to settle conflicts with words rather than swords whenever possible."

All the while, we have been training our soldiers in cavalry tactics that will be vital on the wide open plains of maharaaja - for when conflict with Endhuvi does come, we know we will meet them in the contested lands, and the charge of our elephants and swiftness of our horses shall sweep the river watchers away once and for all."

Efforts by a new cadre of ministers under the young prince Adaraghir helped revitalize Rabaghekhur and turn its focus outwards from the jungles once again, and following the prince's ascension in 1464 Rabaghekhur began to rouse itself from its long period of inactivity and assert itself on the stage of Raheni politics."

These disasters collapsed support for the court of the ineffectual Senapti Bagherad, and soon the majority of the Oghaprabhi were declaring their allegiance to the White Tiger in Tujgal.\n\nFleeing from their ancestral lands, the former Senapti and his family made their way across the waves of the Pearl Gulf to Sarhal, where they were received by the league of mercantile city states that had been built up during the reign of Adaraghir.

Once a captain in the Prophecy Guard, Jagaddipendra was a charismatic man and powerful mage, second only to the Oracle of Tughayasa in skill with divination and prophecy. For unclear reasons, he became disillusioned with the Oracular Order and defected from the guard with a group of devoted followers.\n\nThey fled to Western Rahen and rapidly built up a loyal following among the local people. Using force of arms and Jagaddipendra’s skills of prescience, the various local lords of the west were deposed, and with none left to challenge him Jagaddipendra declared himself King of the Hills and Plains.

Arriving at the city, the captain of the watch demanded that the upstart lord surrender his weapons, but Jaggadipendra answered the man with an arrow in the throat. As their captain fell, the defenders launched volleys of arrows at Jagaddipendra, but he stepped calmly between the falling shafts, none so much as scratching him as he returned the defender’s arrows to them. Each found the eye or throat of one of the guards, and soon the walls were silent save for the choking of dying men. With the defenders dead, Jagaddipendra’s forces seized the city and slew the Raja.\n\nWhen news of this display spread, it so shocked the feuding warlords of Rahen that they agreed to an armistice until this terrible mage could be brought to heel. When Jagaddipendra did finally fall, his bow was recovered by a young warrior who was given lordship over Saddathar.

Meant to conjure the emptiness of the desert in the mind to enable better self-reflection, the Auric Chant is performed by a group of at least five individuals, with two drummers and two flutists accompanied by at least one cantor. The musicians will allow their minds to drift and become still, striking notes that elicit the rustling of wind over sand and the cries of desert wildlife while the cantor provides a low ululating note to center the musicians and any other celebrants that have come to join the group.Famously done without conductors, each variation of the Auric Chant is different, and while considered highly unorthodox by the Golden Palace scholars in Dhenijansar, the local people are fiercely proud of their unique tradition."

With the Ghavaanaj majority, their art has always used dyes and ivory as the primary materials of their art. A particular example would be the intricate scrimshaw ivory carvings made by the artisans - the tusk itself is carved with panoramic scenes of the land, its people and animals, battles, or even geometric patterns. Accentuated with fine painting, these art pieces are shocking in their great detail at minute size. Such art is only ever made by the Ghavaanaj and is well known in Haless, with collectors and nobility coming from far and wide to purchase such unique art."

Opening enrollment in the school to any harimari of the upper castes, the Desert Thunder Academy focused on teaching lessons in both standard infantry tactics as well as desert and jungle warfare. These specialist warfare techniques were combined with a strong basis in Raheni classics and philosophy, producing model young officers who were the very picture of a proper harimari noble."

Growing out of the old tribal contests of the Ghavaanaj, the games feature athletes and aspiring champions from across Rahen, who throng to the city alongside vast crowds of spectators seeking to observe their mastery of staff,  javelin, sword, bow, horse, and elephant. Outside of the reputation and prestige that the games bring for the city, the government is in unanimous agreement that the best thing about the games is the money generated for our coffers by the taxes that can be collected on goods imported to entertain the crowds that come to the city yearly."

Called the Gaji Makhaan, it is only two stories high and lacks any decorations of brass or gold that are so common among the other High Temples. Despite its simplicity, the local people take great pride in the city’s resident High Temple and go to great lengths to celebrate it in spite of its simplicity - flowers and silks adorn nearly every rafter, pillar and hallway in the temple and its grounds, and not a month passes with a new festival adorning the temple in banners and filling its halls with music, shouting, and laughter."

 U17_no_representation_no_tax_desc:0 "The Crathánori secession from Re'uyel was primarily motivated by lack of representation in the newly formed nobles' republic that had overthrown the previous regime. The province of Crathánor had few nobles yet many merchants, and thus had few representatives in the government. This meant that the Crathánori had no power to stop the Re'uyeli nobles from placing heavy tax burdens on them.\n\nAs a result, the merchants began agitating for independence. In 1421 they delivered an ultimatum to the nobility: Give us fair representation, or we will stop paying taxes. This was coldly rejected, and thus Crathánor seceded, adopting a condensed version of the ultimatum as its official motto. This would become the founding principle of the newborn republic."

Only when the dwarves of Ovdal Tûngr came to their aid could the deadlock be broken. But just as the tide had turned, the goblin invasions began in 1423.\n\nIn the decades that followed, the untrained militia fought many desperate battles, winning some and losing many.

Crathánori merchant ships, too, would spread out as far as the rays of the sun, trading in faraway places of the world. Crathánor would prosper greatly as a result and reach the zenith of its power.\n\nBut eventually, the sun must set, as the day cannot last forever. So too did Crathánor's independence come to an inevitable end in 1658. In the dark years that followed, the Crathánori patiently waited for the sun to rise again."

It was originally tasked with guarding the eastern border of the Kingdom of Dameria. Its knights were renowned lancers and participated in many tourneys and battles throughout the centuries, their fearsome charges shattering lines of infantry with ease.\n\nEver since the formation of Anbennar, the Order's status and importance diminished. The long years of peace in Anbennar meant that fewer and fewer knights joined it. Yet the Order served Dameria faithfully until the Lilac Wars. During that conflict, Vincen II síl Cestir, the Duke of Cestirande and Grandmaster of the Order, declared independence from Dameria and joined the Rose Party. In 1444 the Lilac Wars were over and the Order was on the winning side, but only thanks to their betrayal of Dameria."

And lastly, they were among the fiercest supporters of the House of Silmuna, but nevertheless sided with the Rose Party in the Fourth Lilac War. This pragmatic yet dishonourable behaviour earned them few friends but many territories. Unfortunately, it did not result in the prettiest of borders."

Perhaps the most infamous such insult was recorded during the Battle of the Moon Council, when Duke Vincen II síl Cestir called Adénn "Skylance" Silmuna "Brokenlance of the Waning Moon".

But opposing them were the Vernmen of Galéinn, who shared their ambition. This rivalry lasted for countless years and showed no signs of stopping after the Lilac Wars.

The Cestirander breed was versatile, sharing traits of both cold-blooded and warm-blooded horses. The Knights of the Long Lance rode on them during tourneys and battles while farmers used them as work horses. As the importance of cavalry on the battlefield diminished, the latter role would become increasingly important, and the horses were crossbred with cold-blooded ones to make them better draft animals. The Cestirander horses would become the engine of local production, plowing fields and hauling freight."

Yet they continued to diminish as technology developed and made lancers obsolete. Members of the order became little more than titleholders or low-ranking officers in the army.\n\nEventually, however, the Order did have its resurgence. The Dukes and Duchesses of Cestirande began to grant the title of knight to court officials and bureaucrats as a reward for exemplary service. This new generation of knights did not wield the lance, but the pen. The burgeoning paper industry of the Duchy's capital, Cestaire, grew to primarily fuel these new knights and their numerous writings."

Their power was absolute, and only an outside force could bring an end to their rule.\n\nAfter the unification of the Empire of Anbennar, many Cestiranders would work in the administration of the huge nation, becoming vital cogs of the sprawling bureaucratic machine."

Many know of The Necropolis that dominates the city, which was, for a longest time, the largest temple of Nerat's faith until the Bone Citadel in Aelantir, but only historians know that Nerat was not a god of a pre-Elikhet Kheterata, but was in fact a death god imported by Milcorissian slaves.

Therefore Count Austyn II of Gisden welcomed newcomers from the west, many of whom were Alenic Wexonards. The Gisdenese mixed with the new settlers and soon became rather distinct from their other Arannese neighbours, despite still having much in common. This helped with the formation of a distinct Gisdenese identity, which was a combination of Milcorissian and Wexonard traits. This diversity made the Gisdenese more open to foreign ideas compared to their fellow Arannese."

The tradition of herblore is strong in the Gisdenese commonfolk, and many learn in their youth to heal wounds with extracts from the roots of the creeping cinquefoil. This medicinal knowledge was put to use during the White Pestilence, when the Gisdenese mass produced the cure created by Garion the Wise. This was also when the elves first settled in Gisden and founded the Guild of the Silver Cinquefoil, an organization of potion makers and healers. In later years, members of the Guild would invent numerous famous potion formulas."

And this they did, their talented artisans crafting fine copper items in their makeshift workshops. The people were pleased and the Counts kept their promise. Ever since, the Cardesti gather every year in Upsfield to meet and hold traditional celebrations. Many Gisdenese come to visit them, wishing to acquire their valuable metalware."

He wrote countless books, and thanks to the invention of the printing press, his writings were soon produced en masse and sold across Anbennar.

But the Gisdenese had a unique tradition related to their salt: As a sign of hospitality, it was served alongside bread to visitors. This tradition didn't exist merely among the commoners, but even amongst the half-elven nobility, as foreign dignitaries and visiting monarchs were given the same gift. It was said the Gisdenese were the most friendly folk in the Borders, and most welcoming to strangers. However, violating this hospitality was a quick way to become a despised outlaw."

In secret, they signed the Treaty of Gisden, where the Duke of Asheniande and the Marquis of Arannen agreed to partition the County of Gisden between each other. When the two eventually launched a surprise attack from two directions simultaneously, the Gisdenese defenders fought back valiantly despite being greatly outnumbered. With the support of local farmers and their allies, Gisdenese soldiers waged a brutal guerilla war against the occupiers. While they ultimately failed to repel the invaders and Count Austyn V was deposed, the resistance strengthened Gisdenese identity and led to concessions of local autonomy from the occupiers."

Named the 'Farlands', the Bomdan and Raheni peoples had long dismissed Thidinkai as an endless land with a savage and aggressive people - but Harimar saw this as an untapped land full of High Temples to uncover and learn from, after all, what were they fighting so fiercely to protect.\n\nThe answer was nothing. Harimar returned home embarrassed for amassing such a great host. They defeated any army they came across, and stole what meagre riches the land had. But there was only a handful of temples, and none holding great importance.

To charge downhill, through fire and flame, and to clash with a foe that outnumbered you ten to one, was to be the last act of bravery... but Castellos saw otherwise. And during the Castanite charge, what did Castellos do? He appeared in the form of a Silver Dragon and blew the demonflame back at the gnolls, decisively altering the fate of mankind!\n\n'Men of Castanor, be bold, for your arms will not fail you!

From today on, this will not be the case.\n\nOut of silver and mithril, in one year of work, our best smiths forged a huge majestic crown. At the base, shining brightly, is a circlet sculpted to depict the White Walls. Surmounting each tower of the circlet are statues of the gods of the Cannorian Pantheon, encrusted with innumerable jewels. At the center, linked to the interior of the wall by bands of metal, lies an astonishingly accurate representation of Trialmount, topped with a huge diamond!\n\nBut that is not all, as there are actually two different parts in this masterpiece!

Many of the cities were sacked amidst the "Typhoon of Broken Vases," as the infamous event became known, but not Semphrerong — it just happened that the city was between contracts, for the first time in centuries.

But King Levodas didn't weep, and fought on, slaying the three champions one by one and avenging his companions.

To this, a companion of the slain King rallied the warriors yet again, saying “When the last Malacnari is slain, then you will rule Malacnar.", and once he was slain his next best companion rose to revolt, and so on and so forth… And while the outcome of the revolt is history, so is the blood we made Vareynn spit."

In a stark contrast to us, Bostynn has always been the home of fierce, outright obstinate people, who jumped at every opportunity to revolt, forming impromptu bands of peasant warriors who ransacked the countryside until the Imperial army would inevitably arrive to put them down.\n\nThe "Bridge-Wardens" were experienced hunters who frequently put themselves at the head of those revolts and, when not busy leading, constituted the best archers available north of Arverynn.

Brelari warriors have always been noted for their stamina, and they played a vital role in the rise of the ancient Kingdom of Vareynn when in 312, during the battle of Drevonbost, together with Vareynn's soldiers they surrounded the larger Malacnari host and eventually wore them down to the last fighter."

It isn't a coincidence that a thousand years later, Vareynn and the rest of the Ynn have fallen into dynastic feudalism, while Brelar is still a republic."

The River runs strong and great for as far as the eye can see, and the landscape is dotted by watermills that people built throughout the ages to harness a portion of its strength. The modern town of Brelar itself originates from a village built around a water-powered lumber mill, but of course no mere watermill can compare to the Great Ynnic Dams, built by master engineers of old who tragically lost their lives during the collapse of the Ynnic Empire.\n\nFortunately for us, some of them were miraculously escorted to safety here in Brelar, where their descendants live to this day, and it is with their help that we will complete our newest project: we will upgrade Brelar's watermill, to be made huge and out of gold, bringing prestige and respect to what is the symbol of our nation, as well as a crucial source of energy."

They passed many reforms in the administrative field, resizing the provinces to account for the shifts in fertility of the Ynn River, rooting out corrupt officers, standardizing the calendar and formalizing the distinction between central and provincial government. While the empire would erupt into a civil war between Sarda and Dolindhans fifty years later in 896 and begin its slow decline, none could say that it was Brelar's fault."

While there is historical evidence for an ancient group of spies and assassins who protected the Ynnic emperors and were based off the village of Brelarico, rumours that they have continued their operations to this day and are now serving the Brelari state are just that - a rumour."

Before any more Rzentur, new or old, gets the idea to invade us, we should act preemptively: many Old Rzentur tribes would like nothing more than to settle the lands of their cousins to the south, and some of our "traders" will make sure to provide them with the motivations and means to do so."

In order to keep up with this stream of challengers, mandatory training sessions will be scheduled, where our knights will be brought up to date with the latest fencing techniques, riding formations, and fighting tactics of the enemies.

When King Komerjon annexed Malacnar, he cited how the Malacnari followed the strongest, which he had proven himself to be by slaying their king. When King Jeborad crossed the Ynn at Vels Bacar to conquer southward, he did so coming to the aid of his allies in Stanyrhrada. Through the centuries, Vareynn gained a reputation as a just if firm ruler, and its citizens set the standard for what it meant to be honourable and civilized, a standard which lives on through the knightly virtue of today."

Over time the Rider Assembly schemed to gain more and more power, even obtaining the ability to veto the King's decisions and resolve on matters of state independently.\n\nIt was King Joanseln yen Dolin who, in the seventh century after Flood, saw to it that the assembly was limited back to its advisory role and proclaimed himself the absolute Emperor of the Ynn, and while he was assassinated only a year later, his daughter finished the job and put all conspirators to death in a most gruesome fashion.

The hippodrome was thus left half-built, and to this day it remains as a stain on the city's pride, with both the hippodrome and Vareynn being left in disrepair.\n\nNo more!

Particularly fruitful was the trade of lamp oil and ropes made from the fat and leather of mighty Dolindhan animals, and bombs, the manufacturing of which saw a small boom in the Bridge-Town of Bosancovac.

 H25_old_walls_of_amstenur_desc:0 "East of modern Stenurynn are the ruins of Amstenur, the Walled City of the Sarda, an ancient principality with few equals. Its namesake walls were taller and sturdier than even the Great Ynnic Dams of today, and endless assailants and refugees would chip away at them in the hopes of one day breaking in.\n\nIn the sixth century after Flood, Amstenur finally met its end after a two-decades-long siege coinciding with the arrival of the Dolindhans. Its walls were thus dismantled, their stone taken away and used to build the Great Ynnic Dams of today, as well as our castle in Stenurynn. And while our lordship is still far from reaching the glories of ancient Amstenur, we have at least a convenient source of building materials."

Taking place in 628, it was meant to legitimize the governorship of Lord Calsanqir, who had been entrusted the territory of Stenurynn by Empress Zeldja I as a reward for his loyalty during the quashing of the rebellion ensuing from Joanseln's assassination.\n\nWhile initially many scoffed at the mixed marriage, the Empress herself attended it, and the following century would see many more such unions bloom. However, House yen Stenur, created in 628 from the Riverwall Marriage, is and will always be the first Dolindhan-Sarda dynasty."

On that shrine is an inscription celebrating Adrahel, a famous healer who lived between the ninth and tenth century after Flood:\n\n“Friend or foe\nWith the blessing of the River\nYou shall die another day."\n\nAn adept student of herbs and medicine, he saved the lives of many soldiers and knights who would've otherwise died in battle. However, he was ultimately executed by Emperor Calrodiy II for failing to extend the lifespan of the ailing emperor, and many of his discoveries were then banned from publication. Recently, a hidden chamber has been found within the shrine, containing Adrahel's notes: while some of those are outdated for modern medicine, others may just prove vital in saving the lives of our people."

Having been transmitted orally for generations, the story of Arkanvyr was finally put down on paper in the fifth century by the will of prince Valmynn of Amstenur, with later authors rewriting it and expanding it.\n\nIn some versions of the tale, Arkanvyr is a noble hero who strives to prevent the Ending Flood only to tragically fail, while in others, it is the fatal flaws of Arkanvyr and his companions that cause the Ending Flood in the first place. Other authors have chosen to ignore the matter of the Ending Flood completely, focusing instead on Arkanvyr's bravery and ingenuity in the face of unknown monsters and hardships, a bravery which has inspired many a Ynnic knight to do great deeds such as the slaying of Drozmagog, the Rzentur dragon."

Rather than competing for championship, the Knights Oathkeeper have thus decided to serve as law-enforcement, flying their white banners and drapes across the forested countryside as they deter any aspiring brigand and rabble-rouser from disturbing the peace. And while other knights may mock this relatively placid lifestyle, isn't peace what all true warriors strive for?\n\nIn 1721, at the Battle of Delanydon Crossing, the Knights Oathkeeper finally took up arms yet again - but not the arms everyone expected, for they began unleashing deadly volleys of pistol fire upon the enemy lines before their charge, in a devastating combination of Tellumtiri gunmanship and Ynnic chivalry."

Because of his age and wisdom, he was the only one allowed to criticize Lukaus and speak his mind freely. But just because of this he wasn't disloyal: when he was offered immortality by a witch, Jurion refused, informed Lukaus, and rode to destroy the witch and her coven. His son Jansred was an excellent rider and in 143 he ambushed the Malacnari in the woods of Grebniesth, halting their resurgence and avenging the line of Lukaus which the Malacnari had extinguished.\n\nStantirvare was the first contact point between Sarda and Dolindhan civilizations, and while it would ultimately wane in importance and shrink into a village, it was Talanis, the third-born son of the Lord of Stantirvare, who went south and founded House yen Bacar, a patrician family of Vels Bacar that eventually rose to become its protectors and rulers."
 G84_filenval_voyage:0 "Filenval's Voyage"
 G84_filenval_voyage_desc:0 "The Filenval Brothers were two Sarda explorers who in 210 after Flood succeeded at boating across the Ynn for miles. Departing the old homeland near the western mountains, they navigated the Ynn's deadly waters all the way to Stantirvare, the first encounter between Sarda and Dolindhans. Vels Bacar was built in their honour at the middle point of their voyage, and two giant statues bearing their likeness were constructed, one on each side of the Ynn River.\n\nWhen King Jeborad of Vareynn declared war on the Principality of Vels Bacar in 560, he had his soldiers deface the statue of Filenval-on-the-Northern-Side, cutting off his head and having it be replaced by a replica of his own face. After the war was over, Jeborad mockingly told the Bacarans “Find the head, and you can put it back.". Bacaran citizens spent two centuries looking for the missing head, until it was finally found to have floated past Adbrabohvi and the Divine Waterfall, ending in the Nether World where a tribe of Boek had taken to worshipping it. Emperor Calasandor yen Brelar graciously paid for its return, while Jeborad's head was brought to Vareynn. “It was destiny" the Emperor commented “That the head of a great explorer would see the world beyond the Ynn River."\n\nThe statues of Filenval and Filenval stand next to the dam to this day, sending off all the dead who float down the Ynn River."

He is rightfully considered one of the best commanders of Ynnic history and there is much to be learned from his campaigns:\n\nThe beheading of the statue of Filenval, while a vile gesture, was successful in halting the advance of the Bacaran army as well as its cohesion, as they began arguing on whether to march north across the River to take revenge on Jeborad, or continue their war against Adbrabohvi and Stanyrhrada. And as they argued, the Bacaran allies, the Amstenuri, lost a battle they had to fight on their own and found themselves besieged.\n\nIn the second phase of the war, Bacaran sentries kept watch and made fortifications over the fords of Arverynn while their main force engaged the Stanyrhradans, seeing some successes. It was all for nothing when, in 572, Jeborad took the city of Vels Bacar by the storm using a path nobody had foreseen: a massive pontoon bridge had been built in just seven days from one statue of Filenval to the other, and, with the cover of the mist that in rainier days makes it impossible to see the other side of the Ynn, nobody in Vels Bacar noticed Vareynn's soldiers and riders atop their massive antler horses suddenly charging in before it was too late.\n\nThe lesson our marshals have drawn from all this is thus: “Time is of essence.""

 G84_the_bacaran_republic_desc:0 "In 1602 passed away the last ruler of House yen Bacar, Ultaran the Kind. Having foreseen he would die without a heir, he had worked alongside Brelari patricians and Cannorian statesmen to plan transition his lordship into a republic, reviving traditions from the ancient principality while accounting for modern times. And while the first elections were held successfully to the cheer of the people, this move was deeply unpopular with many Sarda neighbours, who called the new republic an anachronism and a betrayal of Ynnic values in favour of Cannorization. Thus began the War of the Bacaran Succession, where Lord Calrodiy V of Arverynn pressed the claim of a vassal of his to rule Vels Bacar.\n\nThe war soon escalated, involving not only Sarda, but also many frontiermen nations and even the Mayor of Valorpoint and the Gospodh of the Rzentur. In the final stages of the war, kobold snipers were picking off Escanni knights and dwarven cannons mercilessly bombarded the walls of Vels Bacar, as other dwarves on the Bacaran side rebuilt them each day and night. The war lasted for 21 years and saw Vels Bacar besieged five times, ending only after the death of a million people and Vels Bacar's destruction. Afterwards, Vels Bacar stopped existing as a city, and its name was only used to refer to the nearby dam."

Once they arrived north, he used his wit and charms to talk the convoy crew into using the stone to build a shelter there, a shelter which became a palace, and thus Stanyrhrada was born.\n\nWhile we in no way condone such a piratesque act, and have in fact sent reparations to the lordship of Stenurynn for the loss of stone after so many years… we do find the story of the exploit entertaining when sung by a minstrel or performed by a theater.

Dolindhans, working with the Epednar, laid siege to Vels Bacar and ravaged the western Ynn while in the east a Veykodan horde began rampaging. Allies turned on one another as cities rose up in rebellion, former generals vied for power and soldiers turned into bandits.\n\nIn this chaos, Lord Adrjon of Stanyrhrada took up arms, gathered the last Imperial forces and loyal knights, and marched to restore order. He defeated the Veykodans, driving them back, then slew the rebels, then managed to relieve Vels Bacar. And when he earned his moniker, Orderbringer, he placed Filimir - a nephew of Varamel - on the throne of Arverynn and swore fealty to him, relenting his own claim to emperorship.\n\nWhile Filimir made a good emperor, he couldn't reconquer Dolindha nor save the Ynnic Empire, and when in 1205 his son Fineas was overthrown and brutally lynched, that spelt the end of any Sarda unity left. Many think that, if only Lord Adrjon Orderbringer had taken the throne, things would have gone so very differently."

Stanyrhradan merchants may operate in royal Dolindhan lands only in the presence of a scribe or town-clerk, and the sale will go directly to Vareynn's state.\n3. The Prince of Stanyrhrada is to be held accountable for any misconduct on the part of Stanyrhradan merchants towards Vareynnic citizens.\n4. Likewise, none of Vareynn's soldiers, riders and mercenaries are to attack settlements on the banks of the Velenynn tributary of the Ynn River, for they are subjects to Stanyrhrada, unless they are seen flying the banners of Amstenur or Vels Bacar.\n5. In Vareynnic-controlled Sarda colonies, Stanyrhradans are to have the same rights as Dolindhans."\n\nSigned by kings and princes long gone, what is not gone are the consequences of that treaty, for when in 572 King Jeborad of Vareynn made good of that friendship and crossed the Ynn at Vels Bacar with an army - a feat everybody had thought impossible until then, it marked the beginning of the Ynnic Empire, of which we were the capital for two glorious centuries."

They were proven wrong when Artorean rode ahead of them and chased the dragon for days, galloping through hills and slopes thanks to the animal's agility and endurance.\n\nWhile lacking in raw power, crossmount riders are able to launch more charges without tiring out during the course of a battle, and, when situations call for unknightly tactics, they particularly excel at harassing marching armies and their supply trains."

Seeing the world of present and past as irredeemably evil, they targeted the Archives for containing memories of the world and its sins, and blasted the building into the Ynn River.\n\nSome books could be salvaged, but most were lost or made unreadable after they had been fished out of the Ynn. No effort was made to restore those books, but recently some councillors have advised our Lord that, with the arrival of so many new people to the Epednan prairie, new Archives detailing their differences would be most useful. While we may never restore those unreadable books, we can seek knowledge from our neighbours, and see if their stories match with ours and can be used to help reconstruct them; perhaps, along the process, we will accumulate so much new knowledge, the resulting Archives will be even greater than the old ones."

Not satisfied with water magic anymore, she would finish torturing them only to kill them then bathe in their blood; drawing power from it, using it to strengthen her magic and stay young forever.\n\nWith most of the Ynn still recovering from war, nobody moved to oppose Mitrenya, except for Vyr Arok yen Clovenvels, a mercenary captain of Escanni origin who ventured into the forests of Vels Fadhecai and defeated her many minions.

It was then that the elf performed his greatest miracle: he went out in the woods alone to confront the wendigo, and scolded it for the evil it was doing. He told told the demon that it was still in time to repent, and that, if it swore to repair the damage it had done, the curse on its soul would be lifted.\n\nAmazingly, the wendigo accepted, and swore an oath to defend Adbrabohvi. No wildlife died afterwards, and the wendigo's soul was allowed to find peace.\n\nToday we remember that elf as Guvnik, and all outsiders who arrive to Adbrabohvi still have to recite the oath sworn by the wendigo on that fateful day, before they are allowed to join our community."

Ultimately, he was able to pioneer the adoption of the stirrup, new banking techniques, and partnership systems across the Ynn.\n\nDespite being born from humble origins, Trhevyr was able to make a respectable fortune for himself: when he returned home to Thromshana in 1583, he paid for the construction of a palace and decorated it with Moon Elven artwork he purchased. Many were finally interested in the tales the so-called "Mad Merchant" could tell, and by the time of Threvyr's death, the letters to and from fellow merchants (and even a few Ynnic nobles) in his palace's archive numbered in the hundreds of thousands.

A Dolindhan suggested that the stronger the will of a piece is, the more damage it could inflict to the opposing side, and that this could be raised by giving rousing speeches. A Trompolerey noblewoman arrived, and she suggested that the game could be performed on special occasions by live actors dressing in costumes.\n\nTo the noblewoman's dismay, the mere suggestion was the last straw for the overworked human siblings: the two speedily resigned and rode out of town, settling to live a quiet life in Tellumtir where they could sustain themselves by winning scraps at the saloons, rather than enduring the cost to their freedom that came with living in the more luxurious Ynnic communities."

All of these dynasties have earned the title of “Everlasting" through their centuries of history, and it would be a scandal if they were succeeded by someone with the wrong hair colour all of a sudden.\n\nSarda families thus follow an “Authenticity" method of succession, where firstborn sons and daughters of a mismatched hair colour are passed over in favour of the child whose hair shade is most authentic to the colour of their family or community, and if none is available, marriages and adoptions can always be arranged."

While you could always send a canoe courier if you were in a hurry, this bore the risk of the canoe getting destroyed by a river monster along the route. The Imperial fleet, lacking enemies to strike out against after the Ynnic Empire's unification, was deemed too costly to maintain and the emperors looked for a solution.\n\nThat solution presented itself in 633, when the Champion of the Ynn encountered an enigmatic Sarda known as 'the Striding Man' who spent his days trekking for miles across Sarda. While the tale of him outrunning the Champion's horse is almost certainly an exaggeration, the Champion was nonetheless impressed enough that he vouched for him with the Empress, and the idea of the Selin Prealtac - “Way Outposts", Seltac for short - was born.\n\nThe Ynnic Empire became thus connected through a network of waystations which relayed messages from one end to the other, similar to the Treehouse Striders of Sarda tradition, but augmented by the new steeds Dolindhans brought. As to the Imperial fleet, its vessels would be later repurposed to funerary barges, and they would meet a gradual, dignified end throughout the reign of Emperor Gamelirn the Pious."

The Cannorians readied their rifles and pointed at our lines, as doubt began to seep among our fighters.\n\nAnd then… it rained. One of the strongest rains seen in Sarda downpoured with no warning over the battlefield, sabotaging the mechanisms of the Cannorian guns and sweeping away the stakes.

Legends speak of ancient antler horses being able to talk, being able to select people for their nobleness and virtue, just like people selected horses for their strength and speed.\n\nThis "force" allowed Ynnic knights to practice for the longest time a hybrid cavalry-foot technique, known as Leomarc, the "Charge-Jump": charging into battle without stirrups nor lances, Ynnic knights hurled themselves into the air and into the fray before their steed collided into the enemy lines, and as the knight began cutting down his many enemies his antler horse would gore and trample to death just as many."

There is however a strict and obscure process involved: differently-raised antler horses can yield antlers that are hardly more magical than wood, while others can easily channel enough magic to lift a grown adult, and only lords and knights seem to have any understanding as to why.\n\nWith an assured control over the distribution of their horses’ magical antlers, Dolindhan nobles used it as an expedient to organize the practitioners of the magical arts, even founding schools or academies for mages managed by trusted people.

Beginning in the 1400’s, several expeditions from both Benter and Mayte territory have pushed the Watchers away from the jungles and savanna on the eastern border of Haraf, establishing new communities on the mountain slopes while further confining our ancient enemy.\n\nOf course, given the uniquely aggressive and fierce Watchers originating from the flat-top mountains of Topetl Icuailoluh who have limited Mayte’s eastward reach for centuries, the King Mask’s influence over these expeditions was rather short-lived, leaving us to actually manage and supply many of the new communities, with the last ones being secured as recently as 1435.

The Cheshoshi were free of the threat of the Silent Watchers, but were instead controlled by the cruel lords of the Bone Citadel. Despite their clear soullessness in refusing to allow a Kalun Spirit to inhabit their body, the many exiles and disenfranchised experts fleeing from sacrifice or worse in the Reaper's Coast to Haraf were a great boon to our slow attempts to organize our disparate people, as the exiles offered their service as advisors to the oldest of Kaluns in exchange for a home."

Clearly, this insult cannot be ignored, and our craftspeople masks, as well as our new community of artificer masks, have resolved to prove these Cannorians wrong.\n\nNow, anyone who thinks that our staffs are crude would be dissuaded by the worktime of months that goes into carving, engraving, and smoothing our so-called “clubs"… as well as the gun barrel and trigger that our artificers have carefully built within the club. Those who question their effectiveness in combat shall find themselves on the receiving end of a gunshot to the chest, followed by 25 pounds of Steelwood, chopped from the mightiest trees in Haraf before being magically treated by our artificers, leaving them harder, stronger and more capable of giving a devastating blow to a maskless than any of their swords."

Now Elrandar led the people of Palaya Orenkoraim to conquer Cankamam. After tearing down the walls and temples of Cankamam, the bricks would be moved along the Kalavend back to Palaya Orenkoraim.

For in truth, we lament its necessity as well. We truly do wish the fields could be tended without the chance of any view of their beauty being marred by an ugly green splotch.

One such group settled in the Magocracy of Esthíl, but in little time they noticed that many of their people were disappearing.\n\nThe truth as to why was quickly discovered: Esthíl’s mage-queen, Varina Escer, was using them as sacrifice in her pursuit of lichdom. Thousands of faithful met a fate worse than death as their very souls were sacrificed to dark magic. Those who escaped had no place to return to, for Ionntrás had fallen to Esthíl's sorcerer armies. Desperate, the survivors rallied behind Father Godwin, a preacher who had received a vision of a new nation for the Corinite faithful, and fled Escann to seek this promised land in Aelantir.\n\nThe memory of the horror that brought them to Aelantir lingers in the minds of the Corinsfielders, and they deeply detest magic of all types. Corinsfielder communities suppress or expel any culture within their realm which permits the study of magic, and magical practitioners are decried as witches and killed on sight."

Third was the perilous Cliffs of Ruin, which claimed a quarter of the remaining men in treacherous climb — and when they had been conquered, they were hounded north by tattooed warriors and horned monsters.\n\nThe few remaining Corinspilgrims were exhausted and nearly out of supplies when they came across a lush prairie filled with red flowers that resembled poppies. The beleaguered settlers took the sight as a sign from Corin that they had at last found their new home, and named the land Corinsfield, dubbing the flowers “Corin’s Poppies”. As the settlers soon found out, the crushed petals of the flowers could be used to make a deep red dye, which would soon become both the chief export of their burgeoning farmsteads and the symbol of their religious devotion.

As a result, the people of Corinsfield have become renowned sharpshooters, and any who would approach one of their fortified communities in war would do so under a hail of deadly-accurate musket fire."

The land itself was fertile and conducive to farming, and the need for many hands to work the fields led to a strong push for large families that would become integral to Corinsfielder culture. In the 1600s, the average Corinsfielder couple would have between 6 and 7 children, and families of 12 or more were not uncommon. Coupled with an early age of marriage, this tendency to large families led to a massive surge in population, and by the 1640s the Corynn river was one of the more densely populated tributaries of the Ynn.\n\nCorinsfield's insistence on firearms training was imposed upon its large population giving them a huge pool of potential soldiers to draw upon when the need to defend their community arose, and the militias of Corinsfield, colloquially called The Red Sentries, were always well staffed and swelled with sufficient recruits."

Every Sorrowday, Corinsfielders would gather at their meeting house or temple and join forces to work on a new community project, which could range from building a new house for a recently wedded couple or repairing the town’s waterwheel to laying down a new road or preparing collective food stores for the winter.\n\nThese constant community improvements would make the towns of Corinsfield quietly prosperous and constantly changing, and although they were never as grand as the big cities of Cannor or the Ynn proper, travelers would liken them to points of light in a dark and unforgiving world."

By and large, Corinsfielders believed that all men are created equally and no man must impose his will over another without their consent. Corinsfield placed great emphasis on this belief in their governmental and religious structures: their administrators and lawmakers were elected for brief terms and could be removed from office if they went against the will of the people.

But for Adrahel, it would be a short-lived one: the captain of the Corinsfielders, Ichabod Roose, questioned Adrahel during the extravagant victory party and came to the conclusion that the rebellion was motivated by nothing more than personal ambition, and so he seized Adrahel and executed him for his act of treachery.\n\nUnexpectedly to many, Adrahel's execution was met with applause by the Ynnics, who saw in the Corinites a possible saviour from the corruption rife in their land. By the end of the day the banners of Corinsfield flew over Fadhevych.\n\nAn emboldened Corinsfielder-Fadhevychi army pushed further into Sarda, onto the Ynnic holy city of Adbrabohvi, which surrendered quickly to avoid the destruction of millenia-old artifacts. Roose promised no harm would come to the city, but rogue Istranari seeking revenge for their failed crusade disobeyed and pillaged the city at night. Losing hope for a victory, the Sarda Emperor proposed an armistice and Corinsfield, already feeling overextended, swiftly accepted. The crusade was over, but the Ynn River Faith would never be the same."

The destiny of Clan Chaingrasper changed with the Week of Stabbings. Making use of his powerful magics, Dak would cast hexes, curses, and other malicious enchantments to bring his rivals to a gruesome end, often at the hands of their own people.

It was only under the care of the newborn Empire of Anbennar, in 1124 that Aramar's mines were for the final time placed in the care of a single entity, the Imperial Mint, under the watchful gaze of the High Fortuner of Ara.\n\nThrough the following centuries the Mint would grow in power, being handed a monopoly over the minting of all coin within the Empire in exchange for its flawless record of producing pure and undiluted coinage. Traders and banks throughout Anbennar, and even the whole of Cannor beyond are reticent to accept coinage with any stamp but that of the Imperial Mint."

In honor of the white stallion, the guardians of the gold and the city that surrounds it carry his name. The Everlucky Chargers are the pride of Aramar, sworn to preserve the prosperity their namesake delivered.\n\nThese paladins of Ara are tasked with seeing shipments from the Imperial Mint safely across Cannor, protecting the goddess' shrines, ensuring the smooth flow of commerce in the city and her lands, and taking up arms to defend Aramar in times of war."

Yet, these are not the only dealers of such dishonesty. Mortal merchants twist words, fudge numbers, plunge knives of usury and greed into the sacred union of seller and buyer that underpins all commerce.\n\nThe Aramari temple holds an ever-evolving codex of laws that serve to clamp down upon the greed of financiers, merchants, moneychangers, and other handlers of coin. While most punishments for these fiscal offenses are metered in fines and revocation of titles and property, none stand quite so infamous or prominent as dealings with and worship of Forsara. Those proven guilty of such dark dealings are known to meet a most terrible fate, the ill-earned coin gained from their bargains melted and poured down their throats."

 A53_monopolized_coinminting_desc:0 "Since the long-gone milennia prior to Jorkad's fall, mages and alchemists have spent their lives chasing the ultimate secret of their craft, the transmutation of lead to gold. And, in that time where the men of Cannor were barbaric nomads, it was found. The Cannorian intelligentsia first rediscovered this ancient lore in a tome produced by one of the Sorcerer King's Acolytes, and summarily, the secret of alchemy's great work was soon set to practice.\n\nThe bank-breaking, unending conflicts of the Wars of Rule set creditors into such a riotous state that most every side involved was employing their finest mages and alchemists in illicit minting, transforming base metals into coinage to bankroll their squabbles. With the abundance of gold flowing through the Empire, inflation shot to astronomical levels, and all sides of the conflict were threatened with the collapse of their economies, and the revolt of dissatisfied peasantry in numbers that even their most powerful mages couldn't crush.\n\nThusly, one of the few agreements found under the rule of Gracos I was the institution of the Charter of Aramar. With a new system of minting devised and implemented by the avatar Nathalara, each Crown crafted at the Imperial Mint would be infused with a distinct magical fingerprint, a universal mark that would show the coins as the sole legitimate tender within the Empire."

So, it seemed only right that, with the Adenners fleeing their shattered kingdom in the wake of the Greentide's relentless onslaught, Aramar would step in as a sanctuary. While some pursued the chivalric courts of far-flung Lencenor, Aramar plunged mountains of gold into quickly erecting sprawling tenements for Adean's folk, seeing that none would be denied a place amongst their number.\n\nNow, the city bustles and bulges with a fresh force of labor to hew her mines, and the teeming tenements brim with the sweet tunes of troubadours' tales of chivalry. Gratitude lingers among Adenners and other Escanni refugees, reclaiming her charitable image and seeing that the temple is owed many favors across the courts of Cannor."

Merchants, adventurers, thieves, and every sort who has known the razor-thin edge of fate pay their due to her, for on The Lady's whim lays fortune or fatality.\n\nIt is said that Ara is one of those lucky few mortals, alongside Munas and Balgar to ascend and stand amongst the gods of the Regent Court. While no histories of the distant time of her life have stood to the present, those theologians who have studied the ancient histories of Cannor have come to believe her to have lived the life of a nomadic chieftess during her time on Halann. The most prominent hypothesis arising from the prominence of Everlucky and the Horseshoe in her symbology, along with ancient relics and texts states that her domain had shifted alongside that of her people.\n\nTales from the days of Castanor, and records of discussion from the Pantheonic council recognizing her ascension hold that Ara's folk, now grown into the Crownsmen once wandered the land in a moving city of tents, so rich with the spoils of trade and plunder that one day, they found they could move no more, lest they abandon their fortune. Forced to forsake their nomadic lifestyle, Ara and her people developed from riders to merchants. However, they never lost the keen sense of adventure and eye for coin. Even with their new home, the followers of Ara continue to thunder across Halann in their unending quest for fortune, to keep the books of their fate forever in the black."
 A53_paper_money:0 "The Paper Crown"
 A53_paper_money_desc:0 "The employment of the gold coin was inextricably linked to its identity as Ara's symbol, and the exchange and counting of coin was held as a sacred ritual to the goddess. As a result, the use of banknotes was seen as impious and even heretical, so vicariously opposed by the Fortuners of Aramar that banks across Anbennar would be reticent to issue them, lest the flow of fresh coin from the Imperial Mint dry to a trickle. The Crown was the sole tender of Anbennar, and the Fortuners refused to see it masked in some Forsaric contract of flimsy paperwork.\n\nHowever, the Great Earthquake of 1672 would result in an ironic collapse. The mines of Aramar were wholly blocked by rubble, halting production, the city crawling to a halt when it most desperately needed an inflow of fresh currency to repair the damage inflicted by the disaster. The High Fortuner stood strong against any proactive changes, bringing the city to a boiling point. She was swiftly deposed in a coup by Ravelian sympathizers, who shortly issued the Proclamation of St. Aras.\n\nThe city would officially adopt the Ravelian faith, and the fortuners would integrate themselves into the hierarchy of the Church in exchange for the Rectorate's aid in rebuilding. The freshly minted Rector of St. Aras would issue a paper currency backed by the value of the gold in its mines, replacing the Gold Crown in a temporary measure that would come to stand in perpetuity."

The cost was paid with the Rail-tithe, a system where we extorted or forced any goblin clan or small enough orcish warband that wanted to move over the railways to give over a portion of their wealth and slaves. In time, this system allowed us to build the forces necessary to take the Heart of the Rails that we now call home."

Still, it is not enough. Scouts report bands of adventuring dwarves have returned to the Dwarovar, from whatever exile they have endured, likely as a consequence of Dookanson emptying the Serpentspine of both orcs and goblins. We must turn Er-Natvir into an unbreakable fortress, as no doubt there will be dwarves who will seek our home for their own.

 Y30_school_of_open_sky_desc:0 "In Aoshan and its surrounds, the majority of Righteous Path practitioners are members of the School of Open Sky. This school espouses serenity and openness, and is one of the more inward-focused orders among the Xiaken. Its masters are known to be pleasant conversationalists with sunny dispositions."
 Y30_proud_mountain:0 "Proud Mountain"
 Y30_proud_mountain_desc:0 "Just north of the western end of the Phokhao Range, a majestic freestanding mountain pierces the heavens. Aoshan, known colloquially as the Proud Mountain, might be called a holy site of the Righteous Path, and serves as a spiritual beacon for students of the Open Sky."
 Y30_the_hanging_temple:0 "The Hanging Temple of Aoshan"
 Y30_the_hanging_temple_desc:0 "One of the wonders of Haless, the Hanging Temple of Aoshan is carved straight into the eastern face of the mountain. As the home of the School of Open Sky, it houses all the masters of Aoshan and plays host to throngs of pilgrims of the Righteous Path from throughout Haless."

 Y30_ancient_architectural_teachings_desc:0 "The techniques used by the ancient followers of the Open Sky to construct the Hanging Temple are heavily guarded by its masters.

 Y30_observers_of_the_heavens_desc:0 "All who inhabit Aoshan wake early in the morning to silently watch the sun rise and contemplate the majesty of the heavens from the grand mezzanine. After nightfall, some masters repeat the process and watch the procession of stars and constellations across the firmament."
 Y30_mediators_of_xia:0 "Mediators of the Xia"
 Y30_mediators_of_xia_desc:0 "Masters of the School of Open Sky are sought across the courts of Haless for their diplomatic prowess. Within the Xia, they are frequently sought as mediators between Xiaken, and the Hanging Temple is often enlisted as the site of diplomatic summits not only between Xiaken but between foreign powers as well. Notably, the surrender of the Righteous Masters to emissaries of Jaher took place on the mezzanine of the Hanging Temple in 1086."
 Y30_impregnable_and_indomitable:0 "Impregnable and Indomitable"
 Y30_impregnable_and_indomitable_desc:0 "Although the lands surrounding Aoshan have been occupied and conquered many times, the temple itself has never been taken. In times of war, the rope bridges that wind down the mountain face are burned and cut, and flying assailants - winged or magical - are easily rebuffed by the forceful winds that can be summoned by the combined efforts of the Open Sky masters.\n\nThis fact has instilled within the people of Aoshan a certain martial resolve, knowing that although their lands may be temporarily ruled by foreigners, their heart can never be conquered."

Anjiang seems to be the source of this information. It is not entirely clear how, though, as they do not employ any seers, but there is an uncommon amount of students in Tughayasa that were either born in, or spent a large portion of their life in, Anjiang. Perhaps that gives some impression of how..."

Whether those people are tricked into letting their guard down - as some warn - is not clear, but it is undoubtedly true that the Anjiang have many friends and allies all around."
 Y04_the_local_debating_club:0 "The Local Debating Club"
 Y04_the_local_debating_club_desc:0 "There is an interesting anecdote from a Cannorian traveller who visited Yanshen in the 17th century. She describes how the Anjiang are very eager to debate theology and philosophy. And not just the well-educated. She discovered that there seems to be a debating club in every district and town, where the locals discuss various aspects of their religion over a cup of tea."
 Y04_a_compassionate_handshake:0 "A Compassionate Handshake"
 Y04_a_compassionate_handshake_desc:0 "There isn't much a little good faith can't help. The support of a friend and ally can give you just the confidence you need to do what you have refrained from doing. This notion is well known in Anjiang, and they have put this knowledge to the test in politics.\n\nThe Anjiang are masters at inspiring confidence in those downtrodden and upset. It is sometimes said that they were behind the Sir rebellion and many other revolts."
 Y04_chow_mein:0 "Chow Mein"
 Y04_chow_mein_desc:0 "Anjiang is both the greatest farmlands of the Yanszin and the largest importer of foreign grain in Yanshen. Most of this grain supply goes to the production of noodles for their national dish: Chow Mein. This is what mothers, grandmothers, and wives feed their family - and they like to say that without this stir-fry dish, Anjiang would be much poorer."

 Y04_wenhe_education_desc:0 "Many aspects of Anjiang society are controlled by a group known as the Wenhe, the gentle. This order of philosophers and monks was founded in the early years of harimar's occupation of Yanshen. While originally they had missions all over the region, by the 1400s AA they were limited to just Anjiang, where they oversaw the education of the youth. However, should an opportunity present itself, they will spring back into action to continue their most ancient of works."

Founded in 276 AA, they are bound together for defense against the surrounding warlords.\n\nOther Yansheni nations do not greatly trust them, yet they always seem to manage to get great deals. They have always gotten themselves out of difficult situations, pulling strings behind the scenes to bring about peace with minimal losses or even gains. Most famously, they would play a central role in the conspiracy that led to the murder of Jaher."
 Y08_the_river_fleet:0 "The River Fleet"
 Y08_the_river_fleet_desc:0 "One of the main features of Yanzhong is its large riverport. This is both where they receive river-going cargo and where they house the river fleet that protects their trade interests along the Yan. This fleet does not merely guard against brigands, it also serves to ensure reduced tariffs that their neighbours may seek to unleash upon merchants bound for Yanzhong."
 Y08_stories_of_men_and_demon:0 "Stories of Men and Demon"
 Y08_stories_of_men_and_demon_desc:0 "Many people visit Yanzhong as they travel up and down the Yan river. And they bring their coin and stories with them. Playwrights and actors have gathered in the middle of this crossroads, to take advantage of this opportunity, and so Yanzhong has become the heart of Yansheni culture. Now, it is not merely a hub for trade, but people come from all corners of Yanshen to witness famous plays and dances depicting the myths and history of their people."
 Y08_the_fishermen_of_da_hu:0 "The Fishermen of Tianhu"
 Y08_the_fishermen_of_da_hu_desc:0 "Yanzhong's positioning between the Yan river and the Tianhu lake has left them uniquely reliant upon fishing. And such is clearly reflected in their cuisine.\n\nTheir particular variety of sweetened, grilled or pickled fish are known and beloved by all, both low and highborn. The largest group of fishermen, those that fish the Tianhu, also provide large stocks of pickeled fish for military supply."
 Y08_zhudezhin:0 "Yanszinwang"
 Y08_zhudezhin_desc:0 "While all are equal within the Yanszin in principle. Yanszin has attained a primary position among its peers, partially due to its wealth in trade, and partially due to its cultural importance.\n\nThe has been able to throw around its political weight to sway the other cities into following its advice. In this it is quite often challenged by the more populous Anjiang, who have always come second. And so Yanzhong remains the Yanszinwang, the Lord of the Yanszin."
 Y08_fraternal_learning:0 "Fraternal Learning"
 Y08_fraternal_learning_desc:0 "While independently ruled, Yanzhong and Yangcheng have been brother cities for centuries, with noble families closely intertwined very close diplomatic ties. Of course there are mutual benefits. As one of the weaker members of the Yanszin, Yangcheng's interests are protected by Yanzhong. In turn the Yangcheng send some of their best scholars to aid in the governance of Yanzhong."

 Y08_secrets_of_the_trade_desc:0 "Merchants from Yanzhong can be found all over Haless, conducting business and sniffing out new opportunities. They have at times been accused of being spies for their home city, but it is never quite clear wether their investigations are of a strictly personal, commercial nature, or whether they have a deeper political background."

 Y06_the_zhinshi_college:0 "The Yangcheng College"
 Y06_the_zhinshi_college_desc:0 "Yangcheng is famous for its university. It produces the largest number of scholars and wisemen of all of Yanshen. Many statesmen also gain their education here, including the eunuchs that serve in the courts of the region. Only Tianlou surpasses Yangcheng in direct connections amongst the eunuch ruling class. Considering all this, it is not surprising that Yangcheng is also ruled by some of the brightest minds in all of Haless."
 Y06_xuezhe_of_philosophy:0 "Xuézhe of Philosophy"
 Y06_xuezhe_of_philosophy_desc:0 "One of the three major fields in which the Yangcheng college excels is philosophy. It is there that the Xuézhe (scholars) of philosophy debated for many years and defined some of the major philosophical principles that would be taken by Harimar, to form the very basis of High Philosophy that would spread across his empire. Their teachings and writings lay at the basis of many of the different schools, but they had the greatest influence on the school of the Starry Eye."
 Y06_xuezhe_of_the_chemics:0 "Xuézhe of the Chemics"
 Y06_xuezhe_of_the_chemics_desc:0 "The second major field in which the Yangcheng college excels is chemistry. The Xuézhe of this faculty have spent many years researching with different elements, making some discoveries that would not be known in Cannor for many decades yet, such as the discovery of hydrogen gas in 1699 AA during an attempt to improve the Feiten hot-air balloons. They do research in the fields of explosives, medicines, poisons, and many others.\n\nAs a result, Yangcheng assassins, doctors, and generals all have the newest and best to apply in their field, even if it is unreliable at times."
 Y06_yingming_analyses:0 "Yingming Analyses"
 Y06_yingming_analyses_desc:0 "One of the reasons that the Yangcheng university is so successful is their methodical approach to experimentation, along with a certain lack of moral boundaries. Anything goes, so long as it is in the name of advancing science. And of course it needs to be properly analysed. The standardised Yingming - meaning smart - method has been relied upon within the university and is applied not only to chemistry but also to cases of law, philosophy, construction and other fields."
 Y06_xuezhe_of_law:0 "Xuézhe of Law"
 Y06_xuezhe_of_law_desc:0 "The third major field in which the Yangcheng college excels is law. Perhaps to be expected, given how much of the ruling class comes to Yangcheng to learn their trade, it is here that many of the novel policies are developed. It was a Yangcheng-educated eunuch that created Bianfang's legal system, for example.\n\nWith all of this experience, the administrators of Yangcheng have created a system that is hugely complex, but due to their great skill, functions wonderfully."
 Y06_fraternal_protection:0 "Fraternal Protection"
 Y06_fraternal_protection_desc:0 "While independently ruled, Yanzhong and Yangcheng have been brother cities for centuries, with noble families closely intertwined and thus according them very close diplomatic ties.

 Y07_the_lanxin_desc:0 "Guhe was for a long time one of the primary locations of settlement for harimari in Yanshen until other cities surpassed it. Nonetheless, the harimari culture that emerged in Guhe influenced many aspects of eastern harimari society. Nowadays, the most prominent remnant of harimari rule in Guhe is the Lanszin, the Blue Star, a military order made up of harimari who have learned to combine aspects of eastern martial arts with their own ferocious fighting style."
 Y07_the_cheng_of_jiushui:0 "The Cheng of Guhe"
 Y07_the_cheng_of_jiushui_desc:0 "The cheng, or citadel, of Guhe is one of the oldest and most many-layered fortresses of Yanshen, having stood for thousands of years. Supposedly, its foundations rest upon the ruins of a high temple, but despite great effort, no good evidence of such a claim has been found. But both Harimar and Jaher saw the strategic importance of the fort, and reinforced it."
 Y07_jahers_blood_well_spilled:0 "Jaher's Blood Well Spilled"
 Y07_jahers_blood_well_spilled_desc:0 "They, more than any other of the Yanszin, played a role in the assassination of Jaher, as his employment of the Lanszin allowed the assassins to come within striking distance of their target. And so the pivotal role that Guhe played in the history and future of Yanshen cannot be denied."
 Y07_the_eldest_yanszin_city:0 "The Eldest Yanszin City"
 Y07_the_eldest_yanszin_city_desc:0 "While all the Yanszin cities are old, Guhe is without a doubt the oldest. Its foundation goes back to a time before the Nadimraj in Rahen and when the earliest stones were laid in Yanshen."
 Y07_bend_with_the_wind:0 "Bend with the Wind"
 Y07_bend_with_the_wind_desc:0 "All of the Yanszin know that the best way to survive is to know when to concede and know when to resist. Like a stalk of bamboo, they bend until their energy is unleashed and they snap back. The Lanszin have adopted this in their martial training, and it has become a staple of Guhe combat."
 Y07_respect_for_the_master:0 "Respect for the Master"
 Y07_respect_for_the_master_desc:0 "While tradition holds that Eunuch leadership is frequently renewed, the respect for the experienced leader that comes from both Lanszin customs and old righteous path traditions has meant that it is expected for the old master to continue to bestow his wisdom upon the people that is his charge."

 Y25_submit_to_the_emperor_of_yanshen_desc:0 "Harimar of the Divine Call dynasty was the first emperor of Yanshen, and his children were so after him. But over the centuries, they lost control to the local eunuch administrators that had been assigned by Harimar to rule at the local scale. And so by 400 AA the Divine Call clan held the title, but it was an empty one. None listened to it and it garnered no respect.\n\nNow, many centuries later, that is changing once more. The harimari of Zongji are once again demanding the eunuchs to bow to the Divine Call dynasty, the emperors of Yanshen."
 Y25_among_the_locale:0 "Among the Locale"
 Y25_among_the_locale_desc:0 "Once the Harimari Empire had grown to encompass all of Haless, its ruling class of harimari split up into several groups, which each assimilated into the local culture to some degree. The Divine Call and many other harimari that stayed in Rahen became estranged from the majority of harimari who still resided in Rahen. In time this led to a rift between the Rahenraj and the Yanshen portion of the empire, dividing them into two. But it left the Clan of the Divine Call uniquely capable of managing the local populace."
 Y25_revitalized_harimari_traditions:0 "Revitalized Harimari Traditions"
 Y25_revitalized_harimari_traditions_desc:0 "A thousand years after the division of the Harimari Empire, the Clan of the Divine Call had lost most of their harimari traditions. They would suffer from this during the turbulent time following Jaher's assassination and Jaerel's civil war, as they did not retain any of the martial advantage they had been born with. So in 1131 AA, Yatasuo of the Divine Call travelled to Rahen, and would return five years later with a rekindled understanding of their ancient traditions. These are the traditions that they would uphold until the final demise of the dynasty."

However, they maintain a far grander interest than merely that in the teachings left behind - they seek to understand how the temples themselves function.\n\nPerhaps one day they may be able to solve the mystery of how Harimar the Great disappeared from the great temple in Tianlou. Until then, they will continue to marvel at the greatness of the High Gods' engineering."

Additionally, he graced every town of moderate size with a new public center for cultural and religious gatherings. The largest was that of Sziangnu, which would featured a total of one hundred rooms of various sizes located around a central courtyard and garden."

He was prepared for this and quickly moved to have her ships surrounded, but Mykx skillfully maneuvered around the Viakkoca fleets at every opportunity she had and managed to escape with her followers to Aelantir.

Aelantir is rich after all, and those riches should rightfully belong to us! That lout Viakkoc claims to be the 'Scourge of All Seas', but those claims mean nothing until he comes here himself.

Many have accused us of being the cause of these disappearances, citing the fact that our islands lie right in the middle of the triangle, or that ships looking suspiciously similar to those that vanished have been seen in our navy. These accusations may be accurate, but no one needs to know about that."
 G93_equal_opportunity_slavers:0 "Equal Opportunity Slavers"
 G93_equal_opportunity_slavers_desc:0 "The Cannorian colonies employ slave labor to work their fields, but their approach to it is much too narrow-minded. They only enslave orcs, and while orcs make fine workers, why limit yourself like that? Gnolls have always had a more 'egalitarian' approach to slavery. Humans, orcs, elves, ruinborn, and anything else we can get our hands on are all fair game to become our slaves, and the increased supply of slaves will allow us to be more productive than our competitors."
 G93_home_of_outcasts:0 "Home of Outcasts"
 G93_home_of_outcasts_desc:0 "As we already operate outside the law ourselves, many outlaws and criminals arrive on our shores fleeing justice from whatever state they wronged. They must already be desperate to come to us, so we should take advantage of that desperation to get them to put their skills to use for us for much cheaper than normal. It's not like they have much choice in the matter, they have nowhere else to go, and if they refuse to work for our prices, we can always force them to work in a different way instead."

Most famous of these is a special drug nicknamed Demon's Blood, produced only in Ilzin Mykx with a secret recipe. Perhaps more important than the black market trade, however, is the fact that this makes it easy for us to keep some of the products for ourselves..."

Instead, Arawkelin gained a strong cadre of former legionaries as new officers and leaders for their armies, training the native Kelino to mimic the days of old.\n\nOver time, these sun elves would later return home to Bulwar peacefully, or go to Azkare for a true semblance of a sun elf-led state, but the country's reliance on foreign officers training a largely native force remained. Just as Arawkelin was one of the first to welcome Cannorian traders, they were also one of the first to adopt their ways of war, and even offered luxurious positions to veteran soldiers to train up their army in this new era of gunpowder warfare."

 H85_idea_1_desc:0 "The Clanboss of the Truedagger Clan employs many assassins and cutthroats for punishing breakers of the law, or whoever happened to cross them that evening at dinner. To steal from the Clan, or worse, the Clanboss, is to invite a knife to your back and a garrote around your throat. Treason is even more ruthlessly punished, with the offending goblin or goblins having wire run through their arms, their legs broken, and then strung up on posts by earlier mentioned wire, dangling several feet in the air. Death is slow and cruel, and any attempting to aid the punished will instead join them."

Many other clans may see this as a critical threat to our existence, as they come armed with new weapons, new tactics and far more zeal than the ancestors which fled to whatever misbegotten corner of the world they had dug to. However, dwarves are creatures of habit and tradition, and the importance they place on their reclamation can be exploited like any weakness. Should we have to combat them, we can easily divert their slavish devotion and short attention spans with a few dwarven “relics” here and there. They will naturally seek to recover what is essentially trash, dividing themselves before us."

 H85_idea_4:0 "The Values of Cunning"

This is one of our people's greatest assets, as it drives us forward. But Clan Truedagger breeds a smarter goblin than the average. There is a time for patience and a time for expediency.

 H85_idea_5:0 "Unrestricted Raiding"
 H85_idea_5_desc:0 "In warfare, nothing is fair. The enemy, regardless of their nature, must be broken in both body and spirit. There are many ways to achieve this, but one that Clan Truedagger finds particularly useful is raiding. By allowing our warriors unrestricted rights to pillage and plunder during campaigns is an excellent incentive to not only move quickly through territory, as their fellow soldiers also plunder the countryside, but keep morale high during sieges."
 H85_idea_6:0 "The Lessons of Leadership"
 H85_idea_6_desc:0 "What makes a leader worth following? Respect? Fear? Violence? The Clanboss of the Truedagger Clan must use a mixture of all three, but not always in equal measure. Sometimes, a Clanboss must be respected and feared, or feared and bloodied. Or violent and respected. A Clanboss who can use and be all three is a successful Clanboss, a Clanboss that fails to inspire these will not be Clanboss for long."

 H85_idea_7_desc:0 "Goblins are fond of explosives, this is a simple, fundamental fact of our people. Finding ways to properly harness this fondness, however, is slightly more difficult. As it stands, cannons are bulky, heavy things unfit to be carried by a goblin. However, one tinkerer has happened upon a method of making a lighter cannon, capable of being carried by a team of eight goblins, two of which are reserved for carrying the powder and ammunition. Though small, these rapidly deployable cannons are capable of being set up in harder to reach places with enough preparation, allowing for devastating ambushes and clever cannonfire."

Still, we find ourselves in an unfamiliar stretch of these great mountains, as we passed an actual dwarven hold, still inhabited by its keepers! Considering Dookanson's mustering, and how many warbands had come to his banners, it is only reasonable to prepare for them to make efforts to reclaim the rails and other holds.

Still, finding the necessary supplies for any large undertaking is difficult in the Serpentspine, be it from military campaigns to construction projects. So, we must acquire money and supplies from wherever we can - and if we have to ste- requisition supplies from our people as needed, then that is a simple, yet unavoidable misfortune.

 H87_idea_3:0 "Collection Administration"
 H87_idea_3_desc:0 "Collecting things from our people was easy, at first. Now, however, fewer and fewer goblins are paying their fair share to the Clan as a whole, and by extension the Clanboss.

 H87_idea_4:0 "Clanboss' Cut"
 H87_idea_4_desc:0 "The effort of attempting to collect from our clan grows more and more difficult with each passing year, as goblins find clever rules or rather clever ways to hide their wealth from the Clanboss. The obvious solution is to simply take a percentage of any exchange or trade. This will allow us to move on from simply strong-arming goblins for big lump sums of wealth infrequently, to a much easier to budget stream of income."

By arranging for certain weapon producers to be given less extensive collection by our special agents, this will allow us to build a better understanding with those who are willing to supply our military forces. As well, it is not like part of the wealth we give away won't end up coming back to ourselves… "

By offering lessened collection and allowing them to keep more of their wealth, we can make them indebted to us in other ways, ensuring that we can make up for lost revenue from the rest of the Clan.

While it matters little what we call it, at the end of the day it seems nobody likes paying up for the good of the state. Taking some inspiration from our kin in Bulwar however, has given the Clanboss an idea. By formalizing the rules of Collection into a series of codes, laws, and formal dates of payment, we can keep our subjects less disgruntled and reduce rock-thrown complaints through the Clanboss' windows- and at the Clanboss in general."

 H89_idea_1:0 "Insult Warriors"
 H89_idea_1_desc:0 "Since their earliest days, the Snotfinger Clan has practiced a tradition of insults, initially designed to lure orcs into prepared ambushes. As the clan moves forward, so too has this tradition. Many goblins spend their spare time perfecting new insults for both rivals and friends. Now their insult skills are not only used to taunt the enemy into their demise, but have also become a tool of diplomacy and negotiation."
 H89_idea_2:0 "Orc Slayers"
 H89_idea_2_desc:0 "Before the Greentide breached through Khugdihr and spilled into Escann, the goblin slave Rurnor Snotfinger led a group of fellow goblin slaves into the nearby caverns, avoiding the fate of those who would become the Common Goblins. Every goblin of Snotfinger knows this story well, and knows the truth of why there can never be peace with orcs. They all must die.\n\nOf course, there are many others who share our hatred of the orcs, and we may find ourselves with strange allies along the way. "
 H89_idea_3:0 "Free Goblins All"
 H89_idea_3_desc:0 "The Snotfinger clan came into existence through our escape from orcish slavery, and none of us have any intention of returning to it. No Snotfinger goblin will ever be a slave again. And though freedom may come with its own problems, we suffer through them, knowing what the alternative is."
 H89_idea_4:0 "Snotfinger University"
 H89_idea_4_desc:0 "Within the depths of Snotslair lies a great complex of goblin learning known as Snotfinger University, founded in 1476 AA and named after Rurnor Snotfinger. Established by the goblins of the Snotfinger Clan as a school of engineering, in time it would become a city on its own merits. The purpose would end up being to both educate the next generation of expert goblin weapon-makers and engineers, as well as keep them and their experiments safely away from where they might blow up something actually important."
 H89_idea_5:0 "Chainbreaker Wars"
 H89_idea_5_desc:0 "Even during the Greentide, the Serpentspine was far from emptied of orcs. Dookanson would send plenty of warbands back into the mountains to rally orcish warriors and capture goblin slaves. This would lead to the Chainbreaker Wars, where the Snotfinger Clan would ambush orcish slavers making their way to Escann and liberate fellow goblins. Some would join with the Snotfinger Clan, bolstering the clan's numbers and further ensuring that the clan could withstand further struggles."
 H89_idea_6:0 "Trade Through The Dwarovar"
 H89_idea_6_desc:0 "With the end of the Greentide, the reclamation of Escann and dwarves returning to the Dwarovar led to a time of great difficulty for Clan Snotfinger. In time, however, trade with the surface would be established. Unlike the hidebound and traditional dwarves, Goblins have far fewer scruples in both business partners and methods of acquisition. Goblins, unlike dwarves, are far more capable in extracting the wealth hidden away in the tunnels and caverns of the Serpentspine. With markets in Escann reopening, it is only natural for us to take our fair share, especially with those unfairly turned away by the dwarves for petty things like “Murder” or “Smuggling”. Of course, taking a little bit extra off the top to finance wars and other endeavors is just the price of doing solid, reputable business in the Dwarovar"
 H89_idea_7:0 "Slobald Piestealer's Gojuice"
 H89_idea_7_desc:0 "Invented by the Snotfinger inventor Slobald Piestealer, Gojuice is a potent concoction originally designed to keep him awake forever, thereby increasing productivity. After making it, Slobald quickly, and fatally, discovered the lethal side effects of continued consumption of his invention.\n\nThankfully his daughter and lab assistant Qihx was able to save the recipe, while also reducing the dosage per cup. It is now used to help Snotfinger soldiers run down retreating enemies, giving them a burst of speed and energy to ensure that none of the enemy escape to fight again."

 H84_idea_1_desc:0 "There was once a time where goblins roamed the Serpentspine freely, without anyone to oppress them. Many clans struggled against dwarves and orcs, but none other had to endure the pain we had been subjected to. As slaves to a black orc warband we were the lowest of the low, we were worth less than the dirt we slept on. But deep in our hearts there stirred a thought. A faint memory of hope that someday we could be free once more. This hope nurtured us, strengthened our resolve. It is only through these decades of hidden resistance that we could eventually gain our freedom from the orcs."
 H84_idea_2:0 "Empty Halls"
 H84_idea_2_desc:0 "The rise of Dookanson meant that almost all orc warbands had left the Serpentspine, leaving behind a gigantic power vacuum that is slowly being filled by the innumerous goblins crawling out of the eternal shadow.

 H84_idea_3:0 "Cutthroat Expertise"
 H84_idea_3_desc:0 "To survive in the harsh world of the Serpentspine the Clanboss needs only the most capable advisors around him. But in a world forged by fearsome strife and bloody battles such as the Serpentspine a simple academic is useless if they can’t fight. To prove that an advisor can survive the world they need to fight for their place. Whoever wishes to lead must defeat the one in front of him. This way only the truly strong will be the ones to advise the Clanboss on matters of state."
 H84_idea_4:0 "Mithril Coinage"
 H84_idea_4_desc:0 "The brutal advisors of our clan demand high pay for their services which has put significant financial strain on our treasuries. To ease the burden we have supplemented their pay with coins not made of gold but of mithril, which we have in relative abundance thanks to our home, the mithril hold of Mithradhûm. This mithril coinage enables us to put our gold to other use."
 H84_idea_5:0 "Reuse Refuse"
 H84_idea_5_desc:0 "Left in the wake of the fall of Aul-Dwarov many holds and roads are full of ancient dwarven mechanisms and machinery of war. Those that have not been trashed by roaming black orc warbands can still be put to some use. Especially the old cannons and firearms are useful once they are outfitted and repaired with what we can find elsewhere. These patchwork weapons are quite hefty and to our delight we have found that they leave more than a few scars and blue spots."
 H84_idea_6:0 "Innovative Mining"
 H84_idea_6_desc:0 "While drills and pickaxes are perfectly suitable tools to scratch the rock of the Serpentspine they are not much use if we want to dig down fast. For that we need to blast away all of the useless rock by firing explosives from our mithril-cannons and free the precious, shiny metals, obliterating the surrounding stone in much the same way as we did to our warband when we gained freedom. These new mining practices will show the world what it truly means to dig a mine."
 H84_idea_7:0 "The Great Shark"
 H84_idea_7_desc:0 "Our clan’s name comes from Glozok the Shark, the goblin who brought us out of slavery and into freedom. Under his leadership we have become more than a ragtag group of warriors. To this day it is his fierce wisdom that guides us and our Clanboss into the future. Each goblin of Mountainshark tries to emulate the genius, the cunning, and the incredible violence which he showed us."

This order of recluses see themselves as the opposite face of the Kabir Drahm from the Drahmgrall, calling themselves the "Forgotten Eye" Rumours spread that the strictness of their adherence to the Dream is a matter of debate. In exchange for being left mostly to their own machinations, they offer their services to the government as occasional advisors by bringing in new ideas from beyond the country.

We will usurp the dwarven machinery's original purpose and bend them to our will. Mines, farmsteads, quarries, workshops, they will all serve Dookan."

 hill_yan_sheng_shan_desc:0 "The Sheng Shan are the holiest mounds in our lands; each one features an isolated monastery, the location of which is intended to bring the monks to closer contact with the spirits that flit around our homeland.

 hill_yan_legacy_of_great_luyixu_desc:0 "Long before the tigerfolk trounced into Yanshen, we were unified under the great kingdom of Luzhongguok, a mighty realm that ravaged much of the Yanhe, striking the fear of the spirits into them and razing countless settlements to the ground to serve as fuel for our rituals. This era ultimately came to an end with the invasion of Harimar, their warriors dismantling the kingdom and establishing fortresses to ensure we would stay under their heel.\n\nNow, with Harimar long dead and Yanshen fractured, it is time for Luzhongguok to rise again."

From the ruins of this castle, the local villagers, grateful to the famed hero for their deliverance, built a great tower, which would later serve as a school for Langzi's students.\n\nHere, students learned to use their chi to set their weapons alight, and even generate combustion reactions from the tips of their blades.

After achieving many victories, we were allowed to settle in an empty area of Xianjie, now known as Rang Nartak. We then converted to the Righteous Path, and have assimilated into local culture.

Each monk of Rang Nartak is granted a white robe at the beginning of training, with the possibility to obtain a new color of robe after defeating 10 opponents in single combat.\n\nAny aspirant must advance through yellow, orange, green, blue, purple, brown, red, and black before completing their training. After this, they may rejoin the temple as a master to train new students. This system ensures that all aspirants are qualified, and gives students a definitive goal to focus on."

What this means in practical terms is that when a new master takes power over the nation, they bring their family members to court with them, where they typically act as advisors.\n\nWhile these recruits may be of dubious quality, it does occasionally bring competent people to the forefront without having to go through traditional channels.

This both saves the spiritual lives of these men and makes them very loyal to our nation for lifting them out of poverty, giving us an unparalleled pool of manpower for our size.

Thus, the realm has many pageants where families can show off their finest elephants, and the best amongst them can be nominated. This has led to an increase in breeding, as families breed their best to create finer offspring in a quest for glory.\n\nWhile these developments have only increased the quality of our herd by a bit, it has increased the quantity of elephants by an vast amount.

We focus on disorienting our enemies by making illusions of soldiers surrounding them, making it impossible to tell what is real and what is not. These illusions are made of the smoke of our special tobacco, making us superior to the typical conjurer reliant on intensive magical abilities.\n\nThis strategy has proven very effective, with many an enemy commander fleeing when outnumbered, only to discover later he faced but a few warriors."

It also removes the wasted time of fighting against the inevitable, allowing people to use their time to the fullest.

These down-on-their-luck sailors can earn their place by lending us their services as soldiers.\n\nOf course, Kairncal's position has made it a valuable target for Cannorian powers, and in 1781 the Vanbury Guild forcibly gained Kairncal as a treaty port from Arakepruni control."

Cardumh is known as the Copperhearth, where countless orders of tools, weapons, and armor are forged by a legion of smiths.

When the need came for cannon warfare, the Copperhearts melted their vast vault to create scores of artillery to blast their opponents.

Creating copper domes, statues, and other features out of copper, the denizens of the city watched as the features changed from gleaming copper to oxidized green. This newfound appreciation of naturally oxidized copper birthed the Sglarder style of architecture, showing the world how rich they are to even ornament their buildings in copper."

Within this chaos, Kelindil Varamzuir, right hand of the king of Dalarand, plotted against his king with the Twelve of Bulwar to assassinate him. The plot was successful and Kelindil carved his kingdom off Dalarand at the end of the war.

While this style was also adopted by the Jaddari, the legions of the Sunrise Empire focused on the collective values of the Halessi peoples and incorporated the ritualistic gestures of the Righteous Path in their drilling techniques, making them a fierce opponent in the field.\n\nTheir most famous technique was the 'Burning Dragon Technique', which was essentially a fire-and-advance tactic done at an incredibly fast pace, allowing an entire regiment to continuously fire on the enemy immediately prior to entering into melee range."

Unfortunately, Jaerel's stance was only seen as a failure to choose a side, which saw many of his allies abandon him.\n\nTimes have changed, however, and as the world is led by the scions of Anbennar, a realm created to bring peace and equality, perhaps Haless is now ready to see that All Are Equals Beneath the Rising Sun."

While the concept of 'the weave' never reached wide-spread popularity, the Monks of the Weaving Palm proved incredibly deadly in battle, evoking arcane spells through movements and gestures akin to chi and cultivation practices, using nothing but their internal energies - the arcane 'weave' in the air - rather than spell reagents and components."

The city was victorious, and when Anbennar was established in 1221, Silvelar acceded to it as a Free City, answerable only to the Emperor, the yoke of its old aristocrats lifted from its shoulders."

Upon the previous Akal's death without a clear heir, she marched towards the palace: beginning as a solitary figure with a tall spear, and ending at the head of a mass thousands-strong. Her claim was incontestable.\n\nAs Akal, she revitalized Kalib's merchant guilds, struck up a personal friendship with Taelarios Irrliazuir, and made sure every peasant knew they could aspire to greatness. The last is her true legacy, as no Kalibi is likely to forget her tale anytime soon."

From djinni teeth to vials of Jaher's blood to peculiar variants of Damestear, the goods it sells are unique in all Halann.\n\nIts clientele included merchants and adventurers, pilgrims and scholars, and by the 17th century, even witch-kings' envoys and Ravelian artificers would on occasion seek it out.

Filinar Alarzuir, governor of Kalib and main Loyalist leader in Bulwar, was defeated by the other governors while most of the Legions were still embroiled in Cannorian wars.\n\nWhen the legionaries retreated to Bulwar after the death of Elizar, they convened the various remaining Elven leaders in the now neutral town of Kalib in 1170. There, under the Imperial campaign tent, Erelessa, head of the Legion, presented a boy called Jaddar as the rightful heir to the Jaherian bloodline. His claim to succession was rejected by most leaders present, and he and most of the Legionaries went East into the Salahad. Meanwhile, Taelarios of Irrliam took the lead in splitting the Empire among the various Elves who all rose from governors to Kings.\n\nWhile the peace it created did not endure, with two more Cinder Wars in the 13th century, the Kalib partition made the city of Kalib famous, and paved the way for a diplomatic tradition the Kalibi are renowned for throughout Bulwar."

But every so often, they do something that makes all Bulwari think they might just deserve their self-possession.\n\nThe most prominent such example is the battle of Wuk, against a gnollish incursion under the command of Zurrek. The battle was lost almost as soon as it began: elven blademasters overwhelmed by the dog-demons' numbers, human steel no match for the ferocity of tooth and claw. The allied forces began to turn tail and flee, but the Kalibi stood strong.\n\nEven as they fell by the dozens, the hundreds, they did not break, they did not budge. They were slaughtered to a man, their blood well-watering the earth, their corpses devoured by their foes, but in doing so they ensured their brothers could fight another day — and that every future Kalibi would demand similar levels of bravery of themselves."

A master glassblower learned of the God Fragment's teachings from the Cannorian merchants he traded with, and in his newfound zealousness, he felt the 'magic' of his craft must be made accessible to all. He published a manuscript detailing how the addition of gold salts during the glass-forming process lends the product a distinctive crimson shade — but even with the secret out, no new cathedral was worthy of its name without Azanerdu glass."

Since those early days it has flourished, even despite the various warlords of Rahen and the theft of their secrets. In the renewed Harimraj, it has become a rival to Dhenijansar itself in its magnificence, due to its nigh-monopoly on the realm's silk supply.\n\nRedglades silk might be cheaper, Bulwari silk more plentiful.

Still, for most, it is largely associated with Harimar the Great.\n\nDuring his rapid conquests after unifying the harimari living in the Jungles of Ascension, Sardiphadin was one of the first major cities to bow to his rule.

They already know the secrets of silk-production, so there are no costs to letting them into Sardiphadin's inner-most sanctums, and they are sworn to protect their charge with their lives. At its peak, the Harimraj banned such practices, treating the Bhuvauri more as foe than friend, but as the ministries grew corrupt Sardiphadin was quick to take advantage. A number of companies have been on direct retainer from Bhuvauri for decades now, and these contracts are the bedrock of Sardiphadin's defenses.\n\nSome thought to reconsider this arrangement after the "Typhoon of Broken Vases" in 1699 AA, when the Bhuvauri were bribed by Lorent with vast sums of money and exclusive Cannorian trade rights to turn on their employers in the Porcelain Cities (recompense for the execution of an elven diplomat accused of porcelain espionage).

And each, of course, needed a new flag to symbolize their new status.\n\nSardiphadin was always quick to leap at this opportunity. One of the first envoys each new monarch would receive was a silk-merchant from Sardiphadin, bearing a rendition of the new banner in finest silk. This gift would pay great dividends — Sardiphadin could expect an order for more renditions within a year, and it always ingratiated these rising powers to the City of Silk."

But most notable is the coming-of-age ritual every male and female Tudhinai goes through at age sixteen: they must spend three days alone in the desert, with only a single waterskin and a loincloth.

But although they were not heavy-handed in their rule, and sought to win over the populace with lavish festivals and generous policies, the Tudhinai chafed nonetheless.\n\nRooted in the Unbroken Claw school's long-standing grudge with the Radiant Sun, the shepherds were often late in their taxes, only paid lip service to Jadd rituals, and nigh-refused to join its legions.

Even Keladora I Birzartantazuir was said to have consulted Azkabari in designing her formidable bureaucracy, and they would play a key role in the administration of the Jadd Empire (and their arguments with Harimari ex-ministers over proper paperwork would become things of legend)."

The corridors that separate the cells are not patrolled by humans or even elves… but by ominous spectral creatures, with an almost blank face dominated by a gigantic mouth that devours the hopes and dreams of its victims.

The lowborn largely saw this as a betrayal of the New Sun Cult, which forbade slavery. On top of this, King Kalinael's early death led to a succession war between Re'uyel's nobility and the king of Baharkand, pressing his queen's claim, leading to increased war taxes and conscription.\n\nThese hardships culminated in a revolt by the lower classes along with the lower nobility, both humans and elves, leading to the proclamation of a noble republic lead by these young enthusiastic officers, a pattern that is continued still.

Their ire had been drawn by a certain gnollish pirate captain, who was known as Korzorra the Scourge of Eborthíl. Korzorra had been plaguing the shipping lanes around the islands of Eborthíl, greatly disrupting the trade through the Divenhal.

Anzabad has never forgotten, nor forgiven, them for this crime.\n\nAt its best, this rivalry pushes every Anzabadi merchant to perform to the utmost, knowing any deal around the Divenhal which does not dock at our ports may very well dock at theirs.

And this belief is only reinforced by the Sunlily berry, one of the more interesting and curious plants native to the region.\n\nWhen consumed, the berry grants a man the energy to go through an entire day, requiring no other food and only a small libation of water. No doubt this is a small emanation of Surael himself, all his life-giving energies condensed into one small ounce of creation.

He rallied the troops left to garrison the city, overthrew the governor and managed to carve himself a kingdom centered around the northern part of the Šad Sur.\n\nIn the following centuries, the small mountainous Akalate became richer and richer thanks to the gold mine in Šad Uraš and slave trade, until most of it fell in the early 9th century to a gnollish invasion led by Jix the Goldseeker.\n\nToday, the majority of the people of the Šad Sur have deserted the mountains due to the repeated gnollish raids, but the traditions forged by Barseen still remain."

When Barseen took control of the place, it was little more than a pile of ruins. His son Bavar I, with his Akalate flourishing, ordered the restoration of the old fortress and turned it into a palace.

He rose quickly in the ranks, imposing the guards' discipline on a small regiment of his own.

A fleet with prototype adjustable angle and direction cannons was dispatched to cripple Einnsag, but to the Guildsman's surprise the less-advanced Einnsagger navy met them in the Gathmarkosk sea. Thinking the Eordan savages who would be easy to dispatch with their advanced weaponry, the Guild fleet fell into a carefully prepared trap. When their sailors were loading the ammunition into the guns, the Einnsagger druids summoned a storm that drenched the enemy. No ordinary storm, the rain still contained the brine of the sea, not just a nuisance but corroding the gears and making their weaponry unsafe to fire. In the end more than half of the experimental guns were inoperable, at which the primitive Einnsagger fleet sank them into the sea."

Once our land was a loyal vassal of Dorcurt, with our Sonad Urian Oakgardner assisting his liege Ladrana Emberborn in uniting the disparate entities of the Autumn Court together. Ladrana Emberborn had invited the premier statesman of the Tuathak in Dorcurt for negotiations, stressing that action must be taken to curb the influence of the Arakepruni and bolster the Hibernal states hold over the north. In a different timeline, Ladrana would be remembered as the uniting matriarch of the Tuathak: but she was already too late and did not notice their eminent demise.\n\nWhilst the Tuathak leaders were gathered in Dorcurt, a Peitar army struck from the depths of the Domandrod. The folly of Dorcurt was the assumption that no large forces could arrive from the Domandrod because of the restrictions on entry enforced by the Gladewardens and fey spirits within. The Tuathak Legion guards were quickly overwhelmed, unprepared to fight such a large force so quickly, and almost all those gathered at the conclave were murdered by the balance-obsessed zealots. The Sonad of Raithtall, Urian Oakgardner fought to avenge his comrades, but was pierced with a poisoned blade. Miraculously, Urian was recovered and returned to Raithtall by a trusted compatriot, but lived the last few years of his life infirm and in constant pain. Upon his deathbed Urian could still see the smoke above the golden forests, and made his son Dharastor swear to avenge him and the all those that fell at Dorcurt."

Eighard stood as the bulwark of the Autumn Court against the unrelenting wintry winds for centuries, until matters of fate thrust them into greatness. Their hated enemies, the Snecboth, were lulled into a feeling of false safety, believing that they had nothing to fear from the Tuathak who cowered in their fortresses until the end of winter. Eighard developed a plan, gathering support from the old Autumn Court of Dorcurt and gathering a vast army of the faithful. A holy war to end the Winter once and for all was declared: once the Snecboth and their lands were conquered by Eighard and their allies, they could end their idolatry and cease the hated season forever!\n\nThe Hibernal Crusade won victory after victory, crushing the Winter Court and seizing the lands eastward towards what would become Jhorgashirr and Slegcal. All that remained was Gemradcurt, but the Esbagg of Eighard, Andrall Harvestcrown, knew that their allies would seize their conquered lands and sought to force their loyalty at Minnorac, the Field of Oaths. This proved to be a cataclysmic mistake, for they were ambushed there by the Strutmar Peitar and the unity of the Hibernal Crusade was shattered with the death of Esbagg Andrall Harvestcrown.\n\nFollowing the ambush at Minnorac, the remaining leadership of the Hibernal Crusade rushed to consolidate power and seized control of the conquered lands, forming the traitorous states of Jhorgashirr and Slegcal.

Raising his host in the far north near the Broken Sea in 1782, Darran Eaglesthorn marched into Dragon Dominion lands towards Arganjuzorn, intent on retrieving the legendary sword. While the Rzentans proved to be untrustworthy vassals, breaking their oaths near instantly, the people of Arganjuzorn recognized their status as subjects to Slegcal. Agreements were made with the Dragon Dominion to allow Slegcaler movement along the upper Ynn, and the first Eordan embassy was established in Svemel.\n\nAt last victorious, Darran drew Dracball from its hilt and spent nearly a month testing it against the monsters of the Epednar plains, including slaying a mighty Poskawa Whale, a gigantic mountain-like fish monster that blends into the rockfields. When news of Cannorian mercenaries invading Slegcal reached Darran, he returned home to face off these invaders but was already too late. Darran Eaglesthorn met his end speared with bayonet during the defense of Eirminn, clutching the bloodied legendary blade beyond death until his fingers were cut off by a looter.

At last, with all the extra land at our disposal, the mandatory work of honoring the ancestors with monumental palaces could begin!"

The citadel of Dungat, the Winter Gate to the Domandrod, was the site where the first Eordan left the mystical forest with hope in a new future; now the imposing Gate solemnly towers over the horizon as a personification of the stubbornness of the Strutmar Peitar. When long ago all their cousins turned to champion the Winter and others took to arms in the name of Autumn, the Strutmari remained resolute in their vow to uphold the balance of the seasons. When the world erupted into war and death, the Strutmari wept for their wayward cousins.\n\nThe gleaming gate, evershifting between every color in the rainbow, shines brightly against the dark, cold land. Behind it may lie a paradise that the Strutmari could retreat to, but the guard will keep watch until their last breath, for they will never abandon the land of promise and hope."

But the Hibernal Crusade forced them to take action, with the near-total triumph of the Autumn Court over Winter. The Peitar tribes gathered to discuss what action to take to curb the expansion of the Autumn Court, and designated Strutmar with the responsibility to take their main force head-on. Hopelessly outmatched, the Strutmari waited and watched for an opportunity... and found one when the leadership of the Hibernal Crusade was gathered by the Esbagg of Eighard at Minnorac, the Field of Oaths, to swear loyalty to him.\n\nTheir Tuathak Legions, heavily armored and disciplined phalanxes, stood watch towards the cold forest whilst their commanders bowed and prostrated. Almost unnoticed, the Tuathak leadership fell to hidden arrow and blade, and their forces soon found themselves surrounded on either side by the Strutmari. To this day, Minnorac is known as Autumn's Grave, where the Hibernal Crusade was shattered before its victory."

Even in the woodlands, food is relatively scarce, and agriculture is not ideal. Temperatures range in the extreme between dusk and dawn, from freezing cold to blistering hot conditions.

Located above a scenic, and symbolic, intersection of rivers, the participants in each case are constantly warned by the churning waters beneath. In the case that an individual is found guilty of malicious intent or gross waste of water, they are lowered into the river in an impervious cage and drowned in what they squandered."

This is hardly a disadvantage, for the Trimgarbers have specialized in manipulating the winds to stir up clouds of sand and dust.\n\nWhile useful when fighting in melee, the sandstorms are an obscuring cloud that allows for sharpshooters to remain hidden and to continuously find hidden positions. Foreign musketeers used to rigid formations or the shield of a tree find themselves hopelessly exposed, displayed best at the Skirmish at Sicranach of 1689 when both regulars and irregulars of the Pearlsedger expedition fired hopelessly into the sandstorm."

Bluewool is sheared from the wooly horned sheep native to the Egasach, although only a few out of every hundred grow blue wool. The naturally vibrant wool is woven into warm clothing and blankets for comfort during cold evenings, but was often made into more finely woven threaded shirts or socks for Cannorian markets."

Were it not for the intervention of the Strutmari Peitar the Winter Court would have been lost, but to the Gemradcurters it was Immarel Winterswrath who saved the realm. Admitted to the Taigan Order and an extraordinarily young age of five, Immarel impressed and soon humbled the high-court druids with her near limitless Wintry magic. Growing up during war with the Autumnal fanatics, Immarel became embittered and resentful, unlike the peaceful patient norm of the Winter Court.\n\nRecognizing her potential, the militarists of Gemradcurt nurtured her rage, and at the age of 11 she had bested the previous Sonad in single combat after becoming frustrated with his inability to combat the Hibernal Crusaders. Immarel and the militarists seized control of the Winter Court, and soon drove out the invaders, ending their advance northward.

Svemelic elves believe that the city was marked as eternally protected by the dragon against those who enter Svemel with harmful intentions. That belief was further reinforced centuries later when Varlengeilt, son of Drozmagog, marked all Dragon Stones in the city with his own blood.

But later Svemel was bestowed with an even greater prize - to be the capital and beating heart of the Dragon Dominion. For the Rzentur people Svemel acts as a cultural and religious centre, both as the place where Drozma Tur originated from and its central position in the lands populated by Rzentur elves.

Named “The Scaled Walls", in reverence of the dragon that once saved the city, they use bricks made in a scaled pattern to reinforce the idea that Drozma always protects the city.\n\nThe first time Scaled Walls saw action was during the Istranari Crusade of 1622, when the Corinite zealots seized the chaos of the War of the Bacaran Succession and invaded Dominion lands in the name of their goddess and laid siege to Svemel. The project was proved to be a success as the Scaled Walls protected the city with the Istranari suffering high casualties and retreating after a year long siege."

During their stay in Svemel, the Green Terror and son of the dragon-god Drozmagog, Varlengeilt, arrived in the city with a speech. During the speech an attempt on his life was made by the Corinite rebels, who failed and proceeded to flee. The brothers decided to intervene and deployed their traps, managing to capture the rebels and bring them to Svemelic city guard.\n\nImpressed by these artifice inventions Varlengeilt granted them an audience. The brothers, seeking an opportunity of a lifetime, asked to build a center of artificery led by them. The dragon, who usually masqueraded in ruinborn form, seeing the practical use of artificery and perhaps kinship with his misbegotten cousins, granted their wish. The city of Svemel sponsored the construction of the first kobold artificer guild in the Dragon Dominion. Soon after, plenty of Greenscale Kobolds migrated to the city and worked under the Bronzeclaw Brothers' leadership."

The project known as “Steel Dragons of Svemel" originally was intended to be a heavy suit of armour with functional wings and a fire breath, similar to dragons. However, the project was not taken well by the clergy and Varlengeilt himself, seeing mimicking the dragons as borderline heretical. As a compromise, the Steel Dragons lost wings and any attempt at fire breath and simply became a well made suit of armour used more frequently in Svemelic army than the previous model ever could have been."

With the arrival of Drozmagog, the living dragon god of the Rzentur people, came the idea that a powerful new state could be forged under its guidance, with the Rzentur people in its center.

By the time it did, this composite army was already too big to not give it support without risking having their holding sacked for “standing in the way of the Dragon's will". Some of those lords gave the army supplies and safe passage through their lands, while others joined the totality of their force to them.\n\nThis army, despite being massive, was heavily infantry based, as well as plagued by organisation issues. So when they were confronted by the smaller but better equipped Dolindhan coalition, an otherwise unlikely defeat occurred.

We lived closely with our people and learned to share in our resources and tribulations, so it was no surprise that when we came to Haraf that the gnomes and goblins went their usual way in their treatment of the ruinborn - seeing them as lessers or a thing to get rid of.

Rocks replaced with shrapnel bombs, tripwires replaced with laser sensors, and pressure plates made into land mines.

On the other hand, Sizapzarko would lend to anybody, particularly those with a shortsighted desire to get rich adventuring.

He lost a paw in a duel to the soon-to-be Emperor, however, and his wound festered until he died in 21 AA.\n\nHis son, Vamayur, was more talented with pen and parchment than sword and shield, and came to Harimar's attention just as he was beginning to be faced with the challenges of governance. Vamayur was instrumental in drafting the Harimraj's first set of laws and ordinances, many of which are still in force today. It was for this service that his dynasty earned the lands of Pasiragha, and furthermore, through intricate loopholes and clever designs he ensured it a place of prominence in the court beyond its seeming stature.\n\nVamayur compiled his lessons and wisdom into a tome, Vamayur's Codex, which was passed down from generation to generation, and from senapti to senapti during the latter Harimraj. Though said to be secret, over the centuries a few copies were made — finding their way into a certain estate's bookshelves in Sramya, and a constant guide to the young Senapti Mahapalar of the Flower Oath — and once the printing press arrived in Rahen, it was disseminated far and wide.

Philosophers and comics alike turned to political cartoons as a way of expressing their thoughts on contemporary affairs.

In Khiraspid, the focus is singular: quality. Even as porcelain became more common in Cannor, following the rush of Cannor-Halessi trade in the 17th century and the opening of the Anbari Emdovu canal, Khiraspid porcelain remained on a tier of its own. The richest Lencori wine-lords, the haughtiest Escanni witch-kings, the most exacting gnomish artificers — all would seek out wares marked with the city's signature identifier: a circle at the center of a horizontal oval."

There are repeated rumours of eyes in the dark, glowing watchers disappearing when you try to bring them into focus. There are no reports of who might bear them or where they come from, but most citizens have seen them once or twice, and almost all swear by their existence. Nonetheless, they disappear when dawn comes and the city's porcelain decorations — each marked with the stamp of Khiraspid workshops — are illuminated by sunlight once more."

Even the legendary scholar-boats of the Kharunyana, where the age's wisest philosophers debate as they lazily cruise down the great river, are not exempted from paying a fee. Though irritating to foreigners, they have little choice in the matter, and this lucrative practice fills Khiraspid's coffers."

 R26_the_white_gate_desc:0 "During the old days of the Rahenraj, millennia ago, many of the major forts of Dhujat grew into cities in their own right. Especially after the conflicts between the Rahenraj and the kingdoms east of it, around 600 BA, Khiraspid was fortified to the point of having some of the thickest and tallest walls. Within it, the porcelain workers felt safe to revel in their riches. But everything changed when Harimar attacked.\n\nThough the walls were insurmountable, the gates were not. The harimari troops quickly breached the city's mighty gates, and quickly overran its defences. But Harimar was a benevolent conqueror, and he saw the value of a kind example in bringing the rest of the Porcelain Cities under his paw. Instead of sacking the city, he allowed its rulers to proclaim him sovereign. Then, before he left, he ensured the shattered gates would be rebuilt out of pure porcelain, a shining white beacon so that all would remember how quickly he had seized the city — and his mercy afterward.\n\nThe days of the old Harimraj are long gone now, but the White Gate still stands, the symbol of Khiraspid and harder than any wood or stone. And though hobgoblins threaten from the north, zealots threaten from the east, Khiraspid's White Gate will stand strong, nigh-insurmountable, against them."

Still others reside in dense, dark, slums. But all are mandated to serve in the city guard from the ages eighteen to twenty. Not a single individual, no matter their fitness or position, is allowed to shun this duty, and it ensures that Khiraspid never goes without a well-manned guard.\n\nThe other Porcelain Cities often looked down on this practice, which meant an apprentice porcelain-worker would share a spear with a street urchin, especially when mercenary forces and Bhuvauri slave soldiers were well-trained, plentiful, and cheap. But it would pay off in 1699 AA, when following the execution of an elven diplomat accused of porcelain espionage, Lorent paid the Bhuvauri a vast sum and promised them exclusive Cannorian trade rights to turn on their would-be masters and sack the city of Keyattordha. That city was left ravaged, and the slave soldiers also looted a few others as they abandoned the Porcelain Guilds' contracts in full. After the "Typhoon of Broken Vases", as the event became known, Khiraspid alone stood untouched."

The practice of slavery is alien to Saamiršes, and our plantations rely on the labour of paid workers instead, who are compensated fairly for their hard work.

The gnollish rule over Bulwar continued to wax and wane through centuries, until eventually being ended by the elves under Jaher. Defeated by Jaherian legions, gnolls ended up pushed into the hills and deserts on the outskirts of Bulwar with almost no city centres under direct control.\n\nAnd yet, we remain and remember.

Calling themselves 'Varbuk's Freemen', they moved around Dalaire freeing other slaves and causing havoc on the colonists. The revolt was seeing plenty of success until the colonial armies managed to secure few key victories and pushing former slaves deeper into Dalaire.\n\nHaving nowhere else to go, Varbuk led his men into the Cursed Forest.

However, that was not the case.\n\nAfter several years of traversing the forest and fighting off the locals, Freemen have emerged on the other side.

 H51_the_bond_breaker_desc:0 "Cursed Ones have been a constant opponent of half-orcs even during Varbuk's initial crossing of the forest, in part due to Kinbond - a telepathic link that allows Cursed Ones to communicate with each other at a distance. Fortunately, Freemarches wasn't the only country with desire to tame the forest.\n\nGnomes from the Broken Sea faced the same problem of Cursed Ones' raids and resistance. To combat them, they invented the Bond Breaker - a small metallic rod that operates at the same frequency as Kinbond, distracting and confusing the affected Cursed Ones for a short period of time. The rod however could work only at a short distance. In order to properly test and utilise this new invention gnomes needed to get close enough to the Cursed Ones.\n\nNot willing to waste their own lives for this, the artificers contacted Freemarches with an offer. They would employ some half-orcs and have them venture into the forest alongside gnomish expeditions to act as a protection against the Cursed Ones, and in return gnomes would provide some Bond Breakers for Freemarcher use. Half-orcs accepted gnomish offer, and this dual endeavor greatly decreased half-orcish losses against their old enemies."

Many locals have lost their families during the Decades of Devastation, Goblin Exodus and during the Samartal investigations and were left with nothing, fighting for scraps on the streets. Overclan provided those children with shelter and food, in hopes the children would work for them.\n\nThe program was a success, with the Overclan raising a proper bureaucratic force within just a decade, which was fully utilised in the subsequent Bahari-wide programs.\n\nA large portion of said orphans was made of Voltoj - half-goblins, who were not always orphans, but castaways from their families. While some human orphans held hatred for goblins, blaming them for their condition, Voltoj unanimously embraced the Overclan and each other as their new family."

 F78_volunteer_militia_desc:0 "One of the lesser known yet longest lasting effect of the Decades of Devastation was the large increase of bandits and highwaymen in Bahar. Those were mostly made of indebted peasants and soldiers, both of which were disillusioned with Elven rule and hostile to the invading goblins, who plagued the countryside and occasionally even raided the larger cities.\n\nAfter goblins have secured their rule in Bahar, many of human adventurers turned to banditry as well. Those former adventurers did not recognise Overclan and saw goblins as mere monsters, harassing any goblin controlled cities and punishing non-goblins for what they saw as supporting the enemy.\n\nThe issue was resolved only following the formation of Overclan. Scouring of the bandits became the first truly united effort in the Overclan, with goblin, human and even some elven veterans working together to end this issue. The proposed solution was the creation of a volunteer militia, which was trained in combined goblin-human-elven tactics and spread throughout the region. The volunteers consisted primarily of those directly affected by the bandits.\n\nWhile Overclan's main armies were focused on securing the integrity of this newfound nation, the militia secured its internal stability by fighting the bandits, while also trying to convince adventurers to stop the raids. The bandit plague met its final end in 1547, when the volunteer militia cleared out the occupied citadel of Azka-szel-Azka, which has been used by bandits as a safe haven. The militia was not disbanded however, and continued patrolling the Bahari countryside since."

In order to do that however goblins needed to atone for the damage caused by their Exodus. That was done with a 37 year long process known as the Decades of Restoration.\n\nWhile primarily Decades of Restoration focused on restoring razed buildings, rejuvenating old farms and resettling abandoned villages, its primary function was to convince other races of Bahar to accept goblin rule. The first few goals were achieved relatively easily, but the racial integration saw heavy resistance. The solution came in a form of Voltoj.\n\nFollowing the creation of a new bureaucracy made out of orphans, half-goblins became an integral part of the Overclan administration and actively participated in the Decades of Restoration. Local Bahari preferred working with more humane looking Voltoj than goblins. Seeing this, the Overclan decided to nearly entirely transfer the integration part of the program to the half-goblins. As expected, half-goblins made considerably better effort in securing good relations with other races, further increasing their standing within the Overclan as they were seen as a thematic representation of Overclan's racial syncretism."

Before the unification of Bahar however, goblin navies were the weakest in the Divenhal, having been sunk by human, elven and dwarven navies on numerous occasions. Once the Overclan formed and integrated other races' designs into their own, the goblin fleet became a common sight in the Divenhal.\n\nDuring the early 1600s, a goblin writer Zyt the Short wrote a history of the goblinkind, in which he claims that goblins have previously conquered two frontiers - the caves of the Serpentspine and the forests of Escann - and that now Exodus Goblins have begun the conquest of the ocean, also known as the Third Frontier. Unsurprisingly, this thought became popular in the Overclan, partially as a reaction to recent successes of Bayvek and Mestikardu, two other seafaring goblin nations. To this day Exodus Goblins commonly believe themselves to be the pioneers of goblinoids, having been guided by Zvaiko Udenzo, goblin god of water himself."

While initially the Bahari were opposed to what they saw as mere looting, the humans eventually accepted, after convincing the goblins to avoid using any explosives.

While the goblins of Bahar have been performing some basic artificery for years, other races of Bahar were much more reluctant to accept this new way of magic.\n\nTraditionally, the Overclan held a policy of religious indifference, but the appearance of Ravelianism was seen as a way to unify all people of Bahar under a single faith. The religion and conversion to it were heavily promoted by the government. Yet Ravelianism only became popular with goblins, with nearly all remaining shamanists having chosen to convert and adopt Ravelian teachings and encouraging Cannorian artificers to move to Bahar. Overclan has since seen greater ties with Cannor and an overall increased spread of artificery in Bahar as a whole."

The situation in South Bahar was quite different, as plagues, conflicts and harpy raids had led to many settlements being abandoned or depopulated. Amarien, the general of Jaher who had successfully ended the harpy raids in the area by burning the nest of the Sad Kuz in her liberation of the Gelkari shepherds, was awarded the fortress of Birsartansbar and the title of governor of Imulušes in 1009.\n\nMost saw it as a bad joke played by her close friend, given it was the weakest governorship of the new empire with the lands it encompassed in a pitiful state. But Amarien saw an opportunity in this devastation: she decided to recruit many of the elves that could not fight in the Legions, or who had already fought but had gotten injured (and left without a manor tended by humans to retire to), to immigrate to her lands. There they toiled the fields, rebuilt whole villages and cities and sponsored a strong elven culture in the hills and mountains\n\nNowadays, nowhere in Bulwar one finds so many sun elves as in Birzartanšes.

But given Birzartanšes' many copper mines, and the tragedies of the internecine Birzartanšesi-Baharkandi war (1419-1423) and the following Dartaxes rebellion (1422-1436), it seemed to many that artillery would be safer than relying on mages.\n\nThe first great cannon of the Birzartanšes army was built by a dwarven engineer from Ovdal Tûngr named Ungrim Thunderhammer, and was at the time the biggest artillery piece outside the Dwarovar. Called Ordalanner in honor of his creator, the cannon was so massive it needed 50 oxen to be moved. This great weapon was instrumental in the siege of the great Dartaxerdim fortress of Kuzak in 1484, its fire shattering the walls in a way only the most powerful of archmages could match.\n\nThe country's early interest was only furthered as artillery progressed over the years, and as the safety of operating a cannon increased, the need for human or dwarven engineers was soon replaced by Sun Elves, who became experts in operating the machinery and the black powder. The royal artillery regiments became the pride of the Birzartanšes army and were feared all over Bulwar for their capacity in siege and on the battlefield."

This inevitably leads to corruption, notably among the Sun Elves, for a bad bureaucrat could remain at his post for centuries and deeply erode the proper running of the state.\n\nFollowing the Decades of Devastation and the revelation of many Sun Elven bureaucrats' mistakes and misconduct, Keladora I Birzartanzuir decided to revive the Jexisian system of examination that was the work of her grandfather Birzartan: Administration posts would be awarded only to those who could prove they were worthy of the position. They would do so by passing an examination that was the same for everybody, everywhere in the kingdom.\n\nThe new class of bureaucrats was still predominantly elven and from the old aristocracy, for only they could spend entire years studying for the examinations, but the testing process allowed the state to remove the corrupt and unsuitable administrators that had plagued it."

The most popular one concerned Dartaxes' father and helped explain to many why this human family had grown to become officers in the Birzartanšesi army, even though Dartaxes himself denied it publicly. To ensure that this problem grew no further, the Jaherian Exemplars in Birzartanšes were tasked to apply the ‘Cleanliness of Blood' Edict, or in Sun Elven 'Silsun Sirad', which required every person applying to serve the state to demonstrate a pure ancestry in either human or elven blood.\n\nThe role of these Exemplars expanded over the years as they began to examine human villages and quarters for individuals who looked "too elven". By the late 1500s, their power was so great that they could even dare to publicly target a prince of the royal family. Taelar, grandson of Arantir and minor prince of the royal family, was caught in an affair with the palace singer and dancer Emmita Nuartu, and got her pregnant.

Prominent figures gather for a soirée during which they wear elaborate masks, drink the finest Jaherian Sunlight, and dance to the sound of famous bands from all over Bulwar. The masks they wear for the dance are then thrown at the end of the night in a great bonfire, in honour of Jexis the Burned.

The Decades of Devastation, along with the Samartal disaster and subsequent investigations, showed to Birzartanšes' rulers that they lacked an efficient way to gather intelligence over their enemies and also in their own country.\n\nThus was created the Pink Cabinet in 1530, headed by Arfil Fajazuir, the elf who had first uncovered the truth of the Samartal tragedy, but had been sidelined by his superiors.

What would allow the Phoenix to rekindle its flames? It would be creating the perfect state, and putting the needs of the state above all else.\n\nShe was the one to craft the now famous ‘Kuil szel-Laded' (‘State Reason') philosophy, the idea that immoral actions could be justified if the state required it. No alliance, no scheme is impure for the ruler of Birzartanšes as long as it allows the state to protect its subjects."

She said to the chieftain that the only way to deal with Amussu was imprisoning him for all eternity, and that she was willing to lead a group of warriors to a place where they could build a prison and guard it.\n\nThe warriors doubted the sincerity of the Djinn, whose interest seemed to be to prevent the rise of new genie-binders. But they accepted the offer, and thus, Ardeth and his kin followed the Djinn to the most distant reaches of the Salahad, when they found an oasis in the depths of a basin surrounded by mountains. There, in the deepest section of the gorge, they build a prison for the god king. Neither Ardeth or their kin ever returned to the eastern plains or the banks of the Suran; they never witnessed the glory of Karqašlu or the darkness of the age of monsters. They stayed in the Nihruqalu, the Silent Hall. Standing guard. Protecting a land that they will never inhabit.\n\nBut at some point their numbers dwindled, and they had to interact with the Salahadesi nomads that would become the Mašnih. They showed to their leaders the unkillable evil that they watch over. The tribal leaders offered to send warriors to nurture the ranks of the szal-Ardeth, and since then, when needed, the wardens recruit both men and women from the other tribes. All Mašnih hold the Szal-Ardeth in high regards, and they will provide any help that they require."

He is credited with presenting the idea to Jaher to build the Golden Highway, although his original plan was to build it in the szal-Mehran lands.\n\nThe disrepair of the Golden Highway and the increased trade through their lands made the szal-Mehran very rich, and their leader Marod szal-Mehran used this new-found wealth to support the Jadd, providing high quality armor and weapons to the Desert Legion."

To better fight the gnolls they have developed a trademark cavalry tactic: They divide their forces in two groups, and while one harasses the gnolls with arrows and fake retreats, the other surrounds them and crush them in a cavalry charge.\n\nThe tribe claims to be descended from Yazkur the Zanite, a warrior that fought in Maqet's rebellion against the gnolls, almost a hundred years before the arrival of the Sun Elves. While most of the former slaves fled south and formed the kingdom of Dasmazar, Yazkur and several warriors stayed and managed to occupy the Harra oasis for a decade, before being expelled by the gnolls.\n\nAnother great clan member was Ekrem szal-Yazkur, who lost an arm fighting Zokka, and during the Battle of Sun's Providence, tried to kill the Pack-Lord before Jaddar could. Unfortunately, he and most of his warriors died at the hands of Zokka's guards.\n\nAfter the battle, the tribe was severely weakened, but they kept raiding gnoll settlements - even those who converted to the Jadd - despite condemnation from the Jaddari."

Despite being versed on trade, they have a strong martial tradition, keeping their bronze-hilt swords with them at all times.\n\nThey claim to be descendants of Attalus the Genealogist, a Bulwari scribe conscripted into Aakhet's army. When the army was destroyed on their way to Haless, Attalus and other Bulwari survivors were lost in the desert, and managed to reach the coast, where they mixed with the local Mašnsih tribes.\n\nThey managed to recover Aakhet's armor from the site of the battle, and they carry it as a banner when they march to battle.

For twelve years he survived, until one night, he and other magi managed to escape. How? Nobody knows, but the group fled to the east, trying to reach Rahen. Many were lost in the desert, and one by one died, until only Fazil and eight more remained. They would not have survived if not for their stumbling upon the lost city and its oasis. There they found the knowledge of Ancient Bulwar, and they decided to keep it safe until the Bulwari were free to practice magic in their own home. They adopted a silver nine point star as sigil, representing the nine original magi and the brightest star in the night sky, Fazil.\n\nThe szal-Fazil are renowned for their wisdom and use of magic, and their magi are usually found in other tribes as advisors. The future leader of the tribe, Kuridon szal-Fazil, was living between the szal-Zaid at the same time as Jaddar began his campaign, and the two became close friends. But Kuridon never converted to the Jadd, and while no one knows the exact reason, it is said that he used one of Ulmišbar artifacts to see the future, and he was terrorised by the endless war that he saw - a war made in the name of his friend."

Some fought hard (and earned a punishing occupation), while others gently acceded to the new conqueror, but none could stand before the desert's storm.\n\nMedurubar was one of the states that fought the fiercest, engaging in street-fighting block by block even after the Jaddari legions had pierced their walls. Even after conquest, legions of Lightbringers could not stamp out this rebellious spirit, and the city remained firmly (if quietly) defiant of the Jadd. The resistance largely consisted of late tax payments and underground dissension — that is, until Surael blessed their cause with a Jadd civil war.\n\nDuring the Deioderan, Medurubar led the revolt against their Jadd overlords and helped secure the independence for several western Bulwari city-states. As the threat of the Jadd was not eliminated, and the Jaddanzar Empire left behind was certain to seek reconquest after licking its wounds, these states united into a loose federation known as 'Surakeši League', with Medurubar being elected the league's first leader."

Finally, those humans with magical talent were able to practice their craft openly, and our humble lands quickly became a home for those with magical capabilities.

Though born of necessity, this tolerance became deliberate under the Jadd, and the mingling of races seen as just another piece of the plan for them all.\n\nThis tolerance did not go unnoticed by the inhabitants of the akalates - an exodus to Hašr was far more appealing, and far easier, for any refugee half-elves than any other.

The Matriarchy of the Far Sands was called Siadanlen, or 'Siaduna's Home', by her people, and she was an impregnable fortress from which the Daughters of Siaduna Flaming-Talon could rule. None could assail her remote mountain roosts, or encroach upon the vastness of the badlands, and for hundreds of years Siadanlen was a major power in the East.\n\nBut the coming of Jaher and the Sun Elves blew like a fell wind across the Eastern Sands, and the Matriarchs of Siadanlen were finally faced with a foe implacable and skilled enough to not only defeat them on the field but to pursue them to their mountain fastnesses and lay terrible siege to her nests. Shattered by Jaher's onslaught, the roosts fell one by one, and countless sisters were killed by the self-proclaimed Sun God. But the years have been long since the Phoenix Emperor cast down the Matriarchy, and the elves are weak and off-balance from decades of infighting. This is the moment to strike, to reclaim the legacy of Siadanlen and revenge ourselves on the elves who still occupy the Far Salahad and the traitorous flocks who have given them succor."

Between the safe havens of Azka Sur and Davharral, however, there is no shelter from the winged corsairs of Siadan, and these caravans make for easy targets. The Siadunan harpies have become accomplished and organized ambushers from their many years of preying upon the merchants who are unfortunate enough to garner their attention, and the gold and captives they carry off from these caravans have made Siadan very rich indeed."

Instead of conflict and rivalry, the matriarchs of the Far Salahad have found that the enmity for the Bulwari and the Sun Elves that they share with gnolls is far greater than their animosity towards each other. Over the years, the unspoken agreements to focus their efforts against the Bulwari instead of each other grew into grudging cooperation between gnoll and harpy, culminating in the first ever official alliance between the two species being forged between the great pack of Zokka Devourer-of-Suns and Chieftess Astarta Siadan's flock in 1424 AA."

Though all harpies are capable of terrible cries, the warrior-flocks of Siadan invoke a special degree of terror and supplication in those who hear their call, and the wise have learned to lay down their arms and goods instead of going to an early grave when the terrible thunder of the Winged Hellscreamers rumbles across the plains."

Those who fell under her rule found the Ivoryfeather to be far from a sadistic tyrant, however - and all those who were willing to regularly pay their tithes of finished goods or specialty knowledge were dealt with fairly under her Matriarchy.\n\nIt was during the days of the Ivoryfeather that the greatest symbol of the Siadunian Harpies was crafted - the Crest of Ishtara, a magnificent crown of gold, gemstones, and the matriarch's own feathers, a diadem as radiant as the rising sun, crafted by a dozen captive dwarven artisans. This resplendent crown is still used to coronate the matriarchs of Siadan to this day. With each new matriarch adding her own feathers to the regal plumes with her ascension, the ever-lengthening rainbow trail of feathers is a visible testament to the power of the long and storied line of great harpy warmistresses who have come before."

The footbow, long a staple of harpy skirmishing tactics, was always useful against unarmored targets but had proven unreliable against shielded or well-armored foes. The penetrating power of the arquebus, meanwhile, allowed the harpies to circumvent the weakness of their shortbows if the problems of long-range accuracy on these early muskets could be overcome. Always militaristic and willing to adopt new tactics, the Siadunan harpies experimented with arquebuses captured in their raids along the golden highway and began to modify their formation flying for firearm tactics in the later 16th century. Young harpies of Siaden would be trained in gunpowder warfare starting at a early age to familiarize themselves with using such weapons on the wing or standing, and the great accuracy cultivated by these youths would be a boon to the Free Matriarchs of Siadan in their long war of resistance against the Jaddari Desert Phoenixes. Delivering devastating volleys on the flanks of an enemy to demoralize or stagger a front line before plunging into the line with razor talons, the harpies of Siadan proved that the Mistresses of the Skies could and would remain formidable foes in the new age of powder warfare that was dawning on Halcann."

A whisper of an age long past, an age thought banished forevermore by Surael's incarnation Jaher. For those Sun Elves Zokka had made a meal of were the first elves to be devoured by gnolls in centuries. A force was mustered to confront the gnoll. It came back battered, scorched by demonflame.

Annoyed at how much loot your leaders steal from you? Simply feel you aren't being fed well enough?

While Varilor's long rule is remembered as a prosperous one, his longest-lasting legacy was in his treatment of humans who lived in eastern Damesear.\n\nWhen other Elfrealms maintained their elven purity - or intermingled to such an extent that they no longer were true Elfrealms - Varilor ensured that the Damerians were able to continue their separate existence under his lordship, leading to Varivar becoming unique among the Elfrealms of Cannor for retaining minority elven rule over a human majority.

The fact that many of Varivar's elves had personally known Munas in life and held great respect for him also played a role, of course.\n\nFor almost five centuries, the Temple of Munas at Varivar remained the center of the Moonsinger's veneration, being eclipsed in importance by the Great Temple of Ibevar only after the temple's sacking by the Wexonards in the aftermath of Dameria's dismantlement.

The Varivarians spearheaded a Silmunist movement among Dameria's former subjects that seeked to restore Silmuna rule over Dameria's former lands.

Since Eargate has traditionally served as the Damesear's first line of defence in the east, the fort of Eargate has throughout the years been upgraded to stay up to date with advancing technology and hosted a small order of battlemages that provided the fortifications with much-needed firepower prior to the age of gunpowder. However, as naval batteries grew more advanced, the seafort on the tiny island of Floodtower Pass grew more important, since it had the ability to intercept any vessel trying to cross the sea to Damesear.\n\nThese fortifications proved crucial during the Corinite Wars, where the water batteries and the battlemages of the seaforts stopped the Corinite League's navies' advance to Damesear, and would have posed a significant obstacle for Camir's invasion of Anbennar, were it not for the sabotage of the fortifications by the Shadowmoon Conspiracy."

First of its kind in the world, Varivar's Marín Company would go on to become the blueprint after which the other marine corps of Cannor were modeled, and even named after.\n\nIn the aftermath of Varivar's annexation, the unemployed marines entered the services of foreign fleets as naval officers and drill sergeants, or formed freelance mercenary companies, such as Laochri síl na Már or the Dameshead Marine Company. From the first landings of Lorentish forces in Noruin, to the Gnomish Hierarchy's invasion of Eordand, these 'free marines' would be vital to the success of countless amphibious assaults, and would eventually form the basis of Anbennar's Imperial Marine Corps."

On the other hand, Varivar's earlier proto-industrialisation had made the region wealthy by Imperial standards, with windmills, shipbuilding, and clothmaking generating an export economy that rivaled those of much larger duchies.\n\nVarivar took a third path, spearheaded by economist and former forester Aveline síl Marionaire: sustainable development. Based on the forest management laws of 1654, which combated the overexploitation of forests for timber with mandatory forest replantings and logging regulations, Aveline proposed an economic policy organising Varivar's economy to ensure that living conditions and the economy's needs were met without undermining the stability of nature. Although the Sustainable Development Act was implemented only at a local level, it nonetheless led to Varivar being the sole voice of sustainable design in the Empire against the chorus of maximised industrialisation, and led to Varivar becoming the center of nature conservation and environmentalist movements in Cannor."

Precisely because the most powerful positions were restricted to magic users, these same powerful people often chose to surround themselves with those who could not possibly be a threat. They often promoted members of the non-magical class based on pure competence, justifying the high placement on the basis of intellectual virtue. This was in stark contrast to many other kingdoms, where promotion was by right of blood alone."

 Z99_the_shadows_flux_desc:0 "Undead are useful on the field of battle as brute soldiers, but they have very limited capacity to think for themselves or listen to verbal orders. Thus, the Demesne had great need for living scouts, battlefield engineers, and officers. Such positions were an excellent way for non-magical subjects to climb the social ladder by making themselves valuable to mages. Every time war was declared, a great influx of some of the Demesne's most intelligent, driven, and ambitious people came to serve the army in all manner of roles, a pattern that would later earn the moniker of 'the Reaper's Gift'."

In the Demesne, it was an expectation and personal obligation for every magical initiate to serve for at least some time in the military. This vastly greater pool of magical manpower allowed the Demesne to turn the entire upper officer corps into the exclusive province of mages, allowing decentralized and responsive magical tactics that were far more impressive than any single sorcerer could achieve alone."

The Sorcerer-King wore a matching ring of dark gold, signifying dominance, which would become known as the Ninth ring. Theoretically, as long as one wore the ring of an Acolyte, one was honorbound to give nothing but absolute loyalty to the legitimate bearer of the Ninth ring in all matters. This reminder of hierarchy and control fortified the political order of the Demesne's upper class."

Often, positions were given to initiates solely on the basis of personal relationships or alliances, as the Acolytes attempted to strengthen the position of their various assets and pawns. This allowed the Acolytes to command a vast, informal power base among a chosen group of initiates, forging an officer corps that was deeply loyal to the Acolyte personally and which sought to perform to their greatest ability in return for the Acolyte's favor."

Over time, the rituals surrounding the rings and the personal relationship between each Acolyte and the [Z99.Monarch.GetTitle] would take on greater layers of meaning, with their formal interactions becoming a dense maze of metaphor and meaning only decipherable by a select few at the heart of the court."

It seemed they, too recounted tales of great dragons, but all these wicked 'chromatics' had taught them was to hoard their wealth in giant underground piles. Yet the Wisest of Masters teaches us that true justice lies not in banishing the wicked, but in transfiguring evil to righteousness. We will adopt the western tradition of hoards, but rather than piling up coins and baubles, we will require every kobold who comes of age to submit one of their scales, with a piece of wisdom written on the back. After all, our people are our real treasures - and wisdom is true wealth."

 Y47_school_of_gentle_fist_desc:0 "There are many secrets about Yizeikwu, not least of which is the School of the Gentle Fist, a derivative of the Xianjie unique to Yizeikwu. The school revolves around, primarily, defeating opponents in the most painful way possible. This is made possible by the precise application of pressure to certain key points of an enemy via an open palm strike. Depending on the area of impact, this can have any number of effects - particularly skilled individuals can delay these blows up to eight hours, bringing a man down as he goes to rest after combat!\n\nWhen brought to combat, this is a particular asset to our warrior-monks; the fast and unpredictable nature of combat leaves few capable of reacting, let alone stopping, to a blow that can incapacitate them as quickly as it was struck. As any could expect, this maneuver is an asset in melee combat."

Before Yizeikwu came to be, the region was nothing but a humble group of villages, controlled by the distant Jinhusi. Their aloof system of government had few problems, until the day arrived when they demanded extortionate sums of money from the villages as part of a Xianjie tournament's financing. In effect, these taxes were so extortionate that every villager would need to sell everything they owned in order to even hope to pay them off.\n\nIn response, a delegation of villagers made their way to a bandit group, the Society of the Gentle Fist, and promised them power for their salvation. When Jinhusi came to collect their dues, their armies were turned aside by the power of a martial art never before seen. It was from this that Yizeikwu was born, and the story of these legends and their mythical (to outsiders) fighting shall serve to instill awe in our nation."

To this end, Gentle Fist monks prove some of the most effective as both guards and robbers. Through its swift incapacitation, the Gentle Fist is able to dispatch any enemies with ease, such that a robber's success is determined by their stealth and ability to carry.\n\nMany warrior-monks use these heists as an opportunity to train their skills, and one consequence of this is that many know all the usual spots that valuables will be hidden."

 Y47_oaths_until_death_desc:0 "Though the Society of the Gentle Fist could have proved as tyrannical as their predecessors in rulership, they demonstrated their virtue in a heartbeat by instead swearing to be the protectors of the realm of Yizeikwu, such that no peasant would suffer mistreatment if they could help it. To enforce this, all of these bandits performed a delayed blow upon another of their number, such that they might die once they broke their oath.\n\nThis tradition carries on even today. Whenever an individual is inducted into an office of sufficient status, a warrior-monk performs the Secret Art of the Gentle Fist, a move that delays an individual's death until the monk decides it should happen, only for their head to spectacularly explode afterwards. Not many abuse the office."

Many of the village militias in Yizeikwu have tested this tactic extensively, encouraging deep bonds between soldiers such that they will fight harder for their friends. It is effective - as proven by the occasion when a contingent of militiamen held their ground against a hobgoblin attack until they proved victorious. Were they not brothers, they would have been rooted long before."

This is only half true; though our soldiers eat as much as any other, a bountiful store of food is carried alongside all armies, and it itself is consumed as quickly as the regular stores. The reality is that we provide a veritable feast to our soldiers on the evenings before battle, often consuming as much as quadruple the regular stores in a single night.\n\nThough it is helpful to raise the men's spirits, this practice also grants us the appearance of being gluttonous - which, though seemingly harmful, has its own benefits. It is particularly humiliating to be beaten by a man you think is a mindless glutton, and because of that our triumphs seem so much more than they really are."

This anger makes them manipulable, easily falling into baits and snares - perhaps even willingly - out of a desire to show their superiority. An angry man dies just as easily as a happy man, in truth, but none remember this in the moment.\n\nThis has been carefully cultivated by our warrior-monks for centuries. Each man is a master at verbal combat, with tongues as lethal as palms. None can make a man as angry as quickly as a Yizeikwu monk. With their expertise we will be able to determine the perfect spots with which to deliver an agonizing tongue-lash."

Their unique mastery of shadow magic makes practitioners of the School of the Looming Shadow masterful fighters and infiltrators, able to mask their presence, muffle their footfalls, and even step instantaneously between distant shadows. Fabled figures such as White Blade An Lai and the goddess Nathalyne are said to have learned these and other exceptional skills under the watchful eye of the masters of the Looming Shadow, and their great renown has made the myth of the school grow even greater. Such powers and legend make the monks of Yantrakari respected and feared among the powerful of Haless, for it is a rare day when one marked for death by the Yantrakari escapes alive. After all, where can you run when every shadow might hide a lethal blade?"

The coming of Jaher and his Phoenix Legions displaced hundreds of thousands of people across Haless, and many of those that fled the lowlands of Rahen and Bomdan would make their way into the misty hills of Xianjie, where they were given shelter by the monks of Wulin. Some of these refugees began to serve the Wulin directly as a show of gratitude for being given a new home. Put to work on less-than-honorable tasks that the masters did not want to be associated with, the early Yantrakari performed with great enthusiasm and zeal as they began to serve their new home. To this day, the Yantrakari families are bound by a strong sense of unity and loyalty to the concept of the Xia as a whole, an oddity among their normally fractious countrymen."

The Phoenix Empire in Haless was deeply unstable for its entire history, and both Jaher and his son Jaerel would be assassinated by Halessi intent on throwing off the Elven Yoke. It was the Yantrakari who slew Jaerel and broke the Phoenix Empire in Haless forever, one of their greatest agents infiltrating the palace of the Sunrise Emperor and slipping past all of his defenders to strike the killing blow. The prestige of that kill, the final extinguishing of the Phoenix's embers, is to this day the greatest glory of the Yantrakari."

Though their loyalty to the Wulin is beyond question, it is rare for more than a token delegation to attend major festivals or gatherings of the Schools, and it is not unusual for the Yantrakari to completely ignore official summons of the Masters. The day-to-day lives of the Yantrakari reveal this secrecy and inward focus to be more than just diplomatic show - folk do not converse as they pass on the street, nor do they hold open markets for the sale of goods or gather publicly for religious worship. Though they are open with those few who prove themselves trustworthy, the Yantrakari's inherent stoicism and reticence to engage with outsiders makes them nearly immune to spies or saboteurs seeking to steal the secrets of the Looming Shadow."

Crafted on looms made of ebonwood, creation of a Shade Cloak involves the weaving of fine silk and threads of shadow together into a product not quite corporeal. Seeming to ever shift as if buffeted by an unseen wind and blending perfectly with its background, those who wear these Shade Cloaks are rendered nearly invisible in dim light. With this tool enhancing their already lethal arsenal of skills, the assassins of Yantrakari are nigh uncatchable when vanishing into the night."

A deeper examination, however, would reveal that Yantrakari towns are anything but ordinary, and running between the various buildings of each community are extensive networks of hidden chambers, false walls, tunnels, and subterranean rooms. These secret living complexes allow individuals to hide themselves away in the presence of intruders, or move swiftly from one side of a town to another for purposes of defending their communities. The great experience that the Yantrakari have developed with labyrinthine building has not only made their homes difficult to conquer, but also made them into experts on creating the most usable space in the smallest area with the least resources."

Among these are a variety called the Qi-Xin, beings of fog that take the form of winged snakes and eat the idle thoughts of daydreamers. The monks of Yantrakari have learned to summon the duplicitous and cunning Qi-Xin, and with pacts and deals have been able to glean great knowledge of the past and present. Some believe that the Yantrakari learned the secrets of Shadow Magic itself from the Qi-Xin - but whatever the truth behind the legend, there is no doubt that the Yantrakari spirit callers are masterful at gathering secrets from across Haless and using them against any targets or enemies of the School of the Looming Shadow."

It protects us from harm, allowing a handful of brave Kuta to protect the rest from harm. It also provides a year-long source of food, providing a plentiful bounty of fish, big and small, for the Kuta to graze upon without concern for harvests or rains. It does this without complaint, and without payment - for most.\n\nWe hold a yearly festival where many fruits and vegetables are thrown into the ocean, a payment in nourishment for all that it does for us, followed by games and festivities where the ocean might watch and be entertained.

There were very few places for constructing powerful ships meant for the open seas, and fewer still to maintain them - the resources were simply needed for other affairs. This all changed when a group of Yanshen pirates sailed to our shores, captained by a pirate queen. Following a friendly reception and a few hours of examinations, they offered a deal: they would pay for the construction of port infrastructure, provided they were given preferential treatment.\n\nThe docks that followed were grand and efficient, providing room for even the greatest ships to come to port and rest. Many new techniques were pioneered in the creation of the first Kuta dock, many of which are still used today to great effect."

Only by joining with another individual and raising a third can someone show that they have set the desires of childhood behind in exchange for the nature of the real world. Of course, this custom has led to high population growth, for everyone wishes to prove themselves grown men and women."

Though the tolls are slightly higher than most, the sheer openness of the docks makes up for it. All individuals, provided that they follow Kuta's laws on dry land, are allowed to do as they please upon their ships. There have been cases of pirates saving their own lives by sailing into Kuta, where their presence was not only embraced, but protected by the local forces.\n\nAs a result, ideas tend to flow in and out of Kuta more openly than any other place, for our extraordinary openness makes our port a far more tempting haunt for merchants; though the sea elves come to buy goods, oftentimes they often also sell new information to be investigated and processed."

It is still up to the sailors of Kuta to fight well enough to turn aside any army. As it so happens, they are capable of just that.\n\nKuta sailors are braver than any other on Halann, and fiercer too. Many a raider ship has been defeated after being outmaneuvered by a Kuta ship, who moved in to board and battle when their opponents would least expect it. Many soldiers first distinguish themselves on the ocean, and nearly all leave with their aptitude at sea unharmed."

They were small, and were designed to be easy to bring to port and depart - for their environment was one with poor ports. They were made to transport individuals and to survey the Ringlet Isles, and were designed with exceptional speed in mind - to evade fights, rather than perform them.\n\nEventually, due to sustained naval combat, these djongs found new purpose. The djongs would be tied to larger, heavier ships, then detached as combat was joined. They were able to maneuver around larger ships and, using the exceptional bravery of Kuta sailors, boarded and neutralized enemy ships-of-the-line."

Increased Cannorian presence in Haless resulted in an even greater influx of information and goods, the most notable of which were missionaries. These Ravelian missionaries eventually found their mark and, slowly, converted the populace to Ravelianism. In the year 1788, a single year after efforts began, the nation of Kuta was the first in Haless to officially proclaim its state religion Ravelianism. A period of openness followed after, where the country gradually permitted more and more business opportunities, including the first organized logging companies for the Lupulan Rainforest.\n\nIt was said that Kuta was the main factor in the spread of Ravelianism, for their native missionaries were more capable of adapting the faith to the unique conditions of Haless."

Her reforms refilled the Brenulan coffers, filled the army with men, and replaced the old administration with a system so efficient we use it even today.\n\nHer genius is the reason we are an independent country today - having defeated Arawkelin without even a single arrow fired - and her reforms, visible even today, are doubtlessly why we are still independent from our old overlords today."

Gasps of fear, unreasonable anger, even inhuman hunger; all of these can be removed by ritual or by elixir. As it happens, many of our country's problems are caused by spirits.

The music of Hebat Hari is remarkable for its fast tempo and strong percussion, and the addition of metallic sounds creates a melody that is incredibly popular, not to mention loud.\n\nAny who fight us will hear the echoes of Hebat music, an omnipresent beat that our troops might march, fight, and die to."

Though the arrival of Pinghoi complicated matters, the struggle with foreigners is one that Hebat Hari is very used to.\n\nThough they might seem superior, none know the Lupulan.

It performed the water dance I have heard so much about, and eventually they animated a second, and the two did all sorts of things, all the while their puppeteers (were those really puppets?) narrated their goings-on.

It takes a special hand to cultivate the land in this way, and our farmers produce more rice than any other place in Haless. This focus on scale is, indeed, one that serves our realm well."

As a rule, these warlords are senselessly brutal or bound to cumbersome traditions, with cultures who cannot see beyond living life as it always has been. Again, Kudet Kai is the exception! Our culture, over the years, has become one of discovery and creation. Our capital, Niravonkai, is an example - and a microcosm - of this discovery and creation. It has been molded into a large city, filled with libraries, observatories, and many more besides - the product of being the one place where all may contribute their findings, so long as they are productive. This openness has made us popular with the learned individuals of Thidinkai and even Yanshen, who are more than happy to lend their services to our cause."

If all were to roam free, at least one would end up similarly to the mad Ghost Emperor.\n\nTo make sure this doesn't happen, we have developed an intricate system of funerary rituals and festivals. All bodies, once dead, are burned. Afterwards, their ashes are placed in a jar, placed with many others, and taken care of by monks. No spirit has returned in anger. Likewise, our people rest easy even in strife and war, for they know that they will not be reduced to mockeries of life after they die."

Yet circumstance cannot be sunk, and her pride and joy was destroyed but a night before a battle with a great host from Feiten, a storm ridding her of every boat save for a single piece of driftwood. Facing death, she called upon the ancestors of all in Kudet Kai to deliver her. They listened. A fleet triple the size of her own came to her aid, and a crew of apparitions and ghosts ushered her to captaincy. With their help, she routed the fleet and saved both Kudet Kai and her own life.\n\nAll of the captains of our nation hold this tale to be true, and all await the moment where they must plead to their ancestors for aid. It shall come when they truly need it, and not a moment further, and for this they fight harder than any other. None wish to plead their case, only to discover their misery is no fault but their own."

As ordered by king Tarakar in the year 1702 AA(many sellswords used the Cannorian calendar, and so it was easier to use it as well) a marvelous building was constructed to hold the Danon Dungcam guild, a sort-of-adventurers-guild used to organize mercenary companies for all to make use of. The most promising individuals were hand-picked and hired for highly competitive wages, recruited into the regular forces of Kudet Kai."

Their appearances are often breathtaking, for a skin as white as porcelain combined with intricate, beautiful clothing combines to create some of the most attractive people in Haless.\n\nFew can resist the charms of a Tlagapatung diplomat, for their unearthly perfection is hard to look beyond.

The pastel tones of their dyes are used to divine the future, with various colors representing different circumstances. For example, an individual's love might be determined by burying pink dye and uttering the individual's name. The earth shall provide an answer - sometimes clear, sometimes not. This divination is a powerful tool, for it allows the geomancers of Tlagapatung to read the future, and in doing so determine the best routes for the country to take."

Subjugated for many years, the geomancers of the land were conscripted for use elsewhere, put to matters of divination and war. It was a dark time for the kingdom.\n\nThat is, until a chief named Caksak Sajan made a fateful discovery. Having found an abandoned statue under the lake, the chieftain signed a dark covenant; they promised the statue followers in exchange for the freedom of his people. Using this power, Tlagapatung was able to break free of the Hebat Hari yoke. Ever since, the whistling people have enshrined the lake.

These rights draw from the Tlagapatung belief that all deceased individuals are tied to the land upon which they perished, and so guaranteeing families land to reside upon allows for their ancestors to stay united and strong.\n\nWhat this means for the state is that it owns far less land than what official records indicate.

The section of the Lupulan that the nation resides in is particularly infested with spirits (both malicious and benevolent) and is rife with their influence. For this, the efficient operation of the council is a necessity.\n\nIn exchange for their duties, this council has managed to carve itself out a very needed niche in the government, and the pawangs hold great influence in the government, unlike lesser spirit hunters."

In 1627, to round off all these events, the Pinghoi pirates invaded Tlagapatung, seeking to subjugate their inhabitants. Though the soldiers of the whistling people fought bravely, their state was so shaken by disaster that it could not provide them with what they required for victory.\n\nThe king at this time, Fazoku, led a band of soldiers to Segat Tidakhui, begging it once more to deliver its followers from destruction. What transpired none can say, but 7 days later the king returned with a band of Hantu, powerful spirits with demonic powers. These Hantu routed the Pinghoi pirates easily, emanating negative energy in waves so strong that those they faced often routed outright. How our patron spirit could summon a host of this magnitude is unknown, but by integrating the Hantu into our regular forces we can ensure Tlagapatung never faces destruction again."

All sorts were named, from minor animal spirits that could hardly be seen on a human's finger to the very spirit of the Lupulan, marking it as one of the most complete almanacs on spirits even to the modern day. These books were popularized in the 17th and 18th centuries as adventurers flocking to the region used them as guide-books.\n\nWhat they did not know is that the wizard writing these was a devout follower of Segat Tidakhui. Countless symbols and hymns to the spirit were disguised within the pages, such that any uninformed individual would be instilled with an unhealthy amount of respect for the spirit of Tlagapatung. The consequences of such trickery is not known, but some rumors have attested to a gradual increase in demonic energy at Tlagapatung's sacred shrine."

One of the most important of these principles is to live in harmony with the spirits of Haless, enabling good while stopping evil. To simply label them all as malicious or benevolent is a harmful designation, and so our people have had to learn the nature of each spirit they encounter.

In order to resolve this issue, we have had to find new combat uses for copper.

In times of peace, however, we used our extraordinary mobility to settle disputes. Many horsemen were talented negotiators, and even when negotiation failed, our riders were able to force a solution.\n\nThe soldiers of the Baihon Xinh, though plentiful, were not able to fully cover every area of the empire.

The last emperor, known posthumously as the Driven Emperor, overheard his sons plotting to shatter his hard-won empire into squabbling statelets. Though he might have loved his children, the mere idea of this disunity was more than he could handle. Mad with rage, he prepared their deaths - yet found he loved them too much to kill them by his own hands. For this deed, he hired an executioner - his first mistake - to kill them all. He failed, and one of the slayers-of-unity fled north, where he prepared the destruction of Baihon Xinh.\n\nUnderstanding the nature of his failure, the Driven Emperor used a lost Khom ritual and killed himself to live as a specter, seeking to dedicate his very existence to saving the empire he so beloved. Even with a forbidden ritual, his efforts fell upon deaf ears as the hated separatists tore his empire apart. It matters not, now, for the Driven Emperor still wanders Halann, rended from his corporeal form, and his presence fills us with the very same stuff he exists from.\n\nVengeance.

Thanks to some well-placed money and connections, however, a Binhrung army and Sirtani raiders arrived and defended Hon Sai from an immediate invasion from Ma Hoang.\n\nNo debt went unpaid that day.

The Khom people have kept this system rigid, going so far as to formalize it.\n\nAn individual lives and dies according to their familial role.

As the Driven Emperor killed himself as part of his immortalization, many took it as their sign to leave. Countless nobles, big and small, fled to Ma Hoang, throwing their lot in with him.\n\nThose few who remained, whatever the reason, quickly found out that they had made the correct decision.

His sons lie dead, their bones ground to powder and forgotten; his restoration of Baihon Xinh has brought it to peaks never before known. With this done, he left this mortal world as gracefully as he entered it.\n\nBy this point the Driven Emperor was beloved by all Khom people, and countless plays and works of literature based on the stories of his life.

Of course, this came with a benefit - we would protect those who paid us tribute. Few tried, and fewer succeeded in their invasions.\n\nOne came closer than most. The elf Jaher marched upon Haless, seeking to subjugate it to elven rule. Though he nearly succeeded in subjugating Baihon Xinh, 300 defenders held a fortress for over six months, which allowed the rest of the Thidinkai to rally to their defense.

This fascination culminated in the Ethereal Makkbom, a large tower which was one of Halcann's earliest formalized observatories.\n\nMany observations of constellations and stars in Haless can be traced to the findings of the observatory, who carefully logged every discovery and pattern. This practice appeared to have contributed greatly to the Risbeko administration, most likely by the development of improved clerical practices."

The Leechmen know nothing of the Effelai goddess, yet they know many things about arms and violence, and perform sacrifices to something writhing deep within the swamps of the Leechdens. To be able to successfully stalk the tribes of these monsters, capture them, and bring them as sacrifices to the Effelai is the greatest feat a Parura hunter can achieve."

Every chieftain is expected to create their own crown, crafted from the trophy collections of their hunts.

Under orders of Director Laurens Silcalas, in 1602 the various ship-borne detachments were organised into the Calasanni Corps of Marines, and soon proved themselves an effective fighting force, most notably against a Lorentish force at the Battle of Neuros, even if still looked down upon by the knights of home."

The sort of ship that could survive the journey across Uelos' Lament was not always the sort that the Company needed, and as its operations grew it soon began building its own. To ensure consistency and a sufficient supply as conflicts against competitors and pirates intensified, in 1633 Director Alfons Silcalas ordered the construction of a set of shipyards in New Calas, and in time the Company's intra-Aelantir sealanes were dominated by fleets of standardised ships built there, known as merchantmen, following patterns drawn up by experts hired from headquarters in Damescrown.\n\nBut not only were these merchantmen used for trade and cargo - they were also armed to protect against pirates or privateers when not sailing in convoy, and though not built to stand against proper warships, they were at times pressed into service to bolster the Company’s navy, and on more than one occasion the additional numbers turned the tide of battle, such as at the Battle of Cape Mordun."

Had the Company remained solely in Cannor, the wars of religion would have divided it, for their noble backers in Arbaran turned Corinite whilst their bourgeois headquarters in Damescrown remained staunchly Adeanic.\n\nBut in their Aelantir operations, such divisions were kept out of the open, for Ara was respected by both the Corinites and Adeanics of the CLSTC, and zealotry had always been ignored regardless in favour of prosperity. Even with the arrival of the Ravelians, religious divisions within the Company remained unimportant, for there was space for Saint Ara of the Ravelian Church in their beliefs too."

Known as dread slavers and merciless marauders, many chose to surrender and accept gnollish oppression rather than fight when Viakkoc's armies approached.\n\nThis experience in domination proved as applicable in newly-conquered Akan as it was in the south.

Arriving at the city of Elikhet, however, Viakkoc the Great found that his army was not alone - Grizaka Emperor of Gnollkind, master of Gnollakaz, had also seen the weakness of Kheterata.\n\nLongtime rivals, the armies of the two gnollish packs clashed before the walls of Kheterat for two days before Grizaka's superior magics proved too powerful to overcome. Unable to retreat, Viakkoc IX and over half of his army were crushed against the shoulder of the Mother's Sorrow and slaughtered.\n\nThe Clash of the Gnolls at Kheterat was an unmitigated disaster for Viakkoc and led to the disintegration of its wider empire. Viakkoc XI, grandson of the dead king, led his people home in the aftermath of the battle and vowed revenge on Grizaka and all her followers. Hatred for the Sorrowclaw Gnolls festered and grew in Viakkoc's court, with heralds decrying the Empress of Gnollakaz each morning.

They dreamed of a Gnollish Kingdom at the heart of Dameria, a Gnollish Emperor on the Dove throne directing a terrible empire, one that would spread the Xhazobkult across the Divenhal and Dameshead. Though they would never achieve this goal, the Corsair Fleet made four great raids on Damesear between 1643 and 1731 in an attempt to gain a beachhead for this new Empire of Viakkoc, burning the forests of Varivar and seizing many treasures from the temples of the Moonmount in the process."

As she was assumed to be the next Xhazobine, this was accepted by the many gnoll packs of the Central Salahad, who rapidly swore fealty.\n\nThough mostly seen a simple declaration of sovereignty over all gnolls, this was truly a reference to that most dangerous foe of the gnolls, the Emperors of Castanor, for Grizaka's great ambition was not just to be another Xhazobine but to be the Castan I of the Gnolls - unifying them into a mighty, stable empire. Though dead before she could achieve this, her great ambition nevertheless still inspires loyalty to the throne few other gnollish states can match."

Kyztzehr, the younger sister, would be victorious despite the support of the Xhazobkult shamans for her elder sister Xukret.\n\nMuch of this was owed to her command of the new bureaucracy established to administer Grizaka's conquests, who enthusiastically followed her vision of a gnollish state founded on the principles of loyalty to the state above all, the pursuit of prosperity by any means necessary, and the pursuit of rapid social and technological progress."

The Cannorians maintain control of their workers through many things, but their most impressive was to convince them that their bondage was a form of freedom.\n\nBy officially privatizing our plantations, and declaring them to be 'company towns', we can free our slaves while still retaining near-complete control of their labor. We must simply pay them in currency only valid within their plantation and they will have no choice but to still work for us. Let us adopt this system and 'liberate' our subjects!"

The families of all gnollish veterans of the Kheteratan Wars shall be granted the rank of ahati, freed from having to pay taxes or tribute in exchange for each family providing us at least one useful soldier for our legions.\n\nUnlike the decadent Kheteratan ahati, which had become purely hereditary by the time of our conquest, this status will be revocable and failure to provide a suitable soldier will see an ahati family stripped of their status and reduced to commoners."

So too had the Xhazobkult been abandoned, traditional pack social systems largely collapsed, and even the very identity of its people changed; the Gnollakazi now distinguished themselves not only as above their human subjects, but also above and apart from the primitive nomadic gnolls outside their kingdom. A truly distinct national identity had been forged."

Putting the tribesmen to work clearing vines and shrubbery, Harimar found the beautifully sculpted walls of a High Temple. Unlike any Temple Complex he’d seen before, the walls carried a deep green color, which would lead Khom to give it the name Xan Vaung in the future. Leaving behind a garrison to study it, he left with his host and never returned, but their descendants would enlighten Khom settlers to the High Philosophy and remain there to this day.\n\nToday, the emerald spires of Xan Vaung stand tall above Ma Hoang as a reminder to all the greatness of the High Gods, and that same authority extends to us as their custodian."

He offered us a mastery of logistics, as well as the charisma and personal connections necessary to bring together mercenary bands at the cheapest price.\n\nBorleah got what he wanted and lived a life of luxury for his service, but his methods for negotiation and the connections he held persist, meaning we never struggle to find cheap bodies to supplement our army."

It gives a stark example of the unreasonable expectations and abuses that go unnoticed and unpunished due to our cultural and legal expectations of duty to family. As the patriarch of the Caoban family, Sang saw his word as law regarding his sons, expecting them to perform whatever he demanded of them exactly as he demanded it. He would work his sons like animals, berating them all the while. So, when he came to find out that they had gone against his wishes and planned to partition the empire after his death, he felt (and maybe was) justified to order their execution.\n\nWe will reform these laws and customs. It is unreasonable for us to continue to expect children to dutifully serve parents who are abusive or neglectful, and never again shall a father hold power of life and death over his child."

Breaking with tradition, the philosophers of Ma Hoang recruited a group of Xianjie monks to join them in their study of Xan Vaung. The monks argued well that a particular mural held a far more martial connotation than previously believed. The philosophers took this revelation to heart, believing that the methods of chi cultivation the monks practiced gave new insight into the High Gods, and begged to be taught how to perform it. The monks relented, and a new tradition was born.\n\nThis new class came to be known as the Righteous Philosophers, adherents of the High Philosophy but trained in the Righteous Path. While lacking in their formal scholarly education compared to their colleagues, the Righteous Philosophers bring to any debate a unique perspective tempered by rigorous physical and spiritual training."

Even after losing its empire, the spirit raged on, tormenting the people of Tuan Caoban in their dreams and sending familiars to abduct innocents from the streets for use in nefarious rituals. It took the efforts of the new emperor and a host of spirit hunters to finally put an end to it.\n\nChanged by the events he experienced within that palace, the emperor worked with what lucky few survived the ordeal to establish the Order of Banishment, a governmental body that would train and deploy spirit hunters to put down any spirit that threatened the status quo. As a result of their work, the people feel safer, and stability rules."

Legend has it, centuries ago, a foreign dignitary visited with whom we were not on the best of terms, and the chefs perhaps used a bit too much spice when preparing his meal.

The untimely collapse of the Hierarchy would see their numbers bolstered even further by waves of gnomish upper class refugees who flocked to the shelter provided by their close ally. As a whole, these Delta Gnomes who once comprised the upper echelon of classical gnomish society still maintain many of the traditions and customs of the Old Hierarchy that have otherwise been forgotten by their Cannorian brethren.

The key to this success lay in the ingenuity of the Delta Gnomes, who have cultivated their namesake with precision and care, constructing levees and dams throughout the delta. Dried drainage canals line the city, stretchmarks that serve as testament to the countless acres reclaimed from the wetlands and repurposed for urban development.

The ascension of Khetarch Amsiskhet III, however, saw a resurgence in the influence of the Delta Gnomes when he elected to fill his court with gnomish advisors, directing them in particular down the burgeoning field of artificery.\n\nThe magnum opus of this brief period of artifice in Kheterata would no doubt be the Mechamel - an ingenious if somewhat uncanny automaton that could only charitably be said to resemble a camel. Ambling about on dexterous, extendable legs of metal and comfortably capable of seating two, the Mechamel promised to revolutionize the otherwise labor intensive lives of the Kheteratan peasant.

These faceted gems with 56 cuts would become a trademark of the Delta Gnomes, yet to produce a gemstone of such obscene refinement was a painstakingly slow process that required a lapidarist with a lifetime's experience. Consequently, these powerful weapons soon became an artifact of classical antiquity wielded only by arcanists of both extreme skill and wealth.\n\nWith the advent of artificery, however, the degree of scientific precision that a Gnomish Cut gemstone could provide led to an explosion in their demand. Fortunately, due to numerous advancements in lapidary technology over the intervening centuries, the Delta Gnomes were at last more than able to meet the renewed demand for their legendary cut."

But as the corps ventured the world, making contact with various cultures and races, establishing embassies, encouraging trade, and much more - all in the pursuit of accomplishing its intended purpose - it became clearer and clearer that this institution had the potential to become something greater. As such, while officially the Corps' mission remained unaltered, the group became the main representative of Varainéy diplomacy (and in may cases, Cannor as a whole), fostering relations with nations from Eordand to Far Haless."

And central to the spread of gunpowder to Cannor was the Esmarian county of Varainé: As a natural source of Sulfur, Potash and Charcoal, it was a prime location for the production and development of this resource. And whilst other nations such as Telgeir would be in the forefront of worldwide weapons production, Varainé powder would remain some of the finest in Cannor, if not in all Halann" - Excerpt from 'Fine Powder: The History of Firearms', 1892, by Dostan sína Ronn"

The Rzentur army became known as the Great Dragon Host by our people, or Great Heathen Host by the river cultists, its size being one of the largest recorded in Ynnic history.\n\nWhile the Rzentur were eventually defeated, and Drozmagog slain, they did manage to capture the lands now know as Juzondezan. The veterans of the Great Dragon Host settled there, and with memories of this army persist to the modern day, with the Juzondezani elves believing themselves to be its heirs."

Having consistantly wreaked havoc on Rzentur troops, the Juzondezani quickly began finding a way to combat them. Their solution came in the form of a weapon; halberds. Using their length to stop the charging knights, and then finishing the downed soldiers with decisive blows, Juzondezan fared far better against the Dolindhans. The halberds' quality came with a hefty price, however, and only a few select regiments were able to wield them."

Wary of another betrayal should the tide turn in Rzenta, especially in the face of the rising tide of Corinism to the east, action was taken. Utilising those Juzondezani that had stayed loyal to the Dominion, the Seekers were established, a secret police organisation focused on rooting out the disloyal elements found in Dolindha. Even the sight of their dark, hooded robes might as well be a death sentence for the enemies of Drozma Tur."

Ever since his auspicious hatching in 1444 AA, ascetics also came to be closer to Varlengeilt, the son of Drozmagog. The very best of these, morally and spiritually, would then be chosen by the Ustajanky ik Drozma, or Mouths of the Dragon, Varlengeilt’s personal tutors, educators, and priests.

The next day, the elf tried to leave on his journey, but the family insisted the elf of the mountain stay for another night. And so the elf of the mountain reciprocated this favour by teaching them how to make cheese from moose milk.\n\nThe third day, the elf departed, but just as he was about to vanish on the edge of the horizon, he turned back and spoke to the family: “Fools!

Whilst the Cannorians are of a multitude of different races, the beings known as kobolds, which we dubbed 'Varlusgie' for the green scales of the first to arrive, are a strange, almost distorted mirror to the Drozma Tur. Small, wingless and almost like humanoid dragons, they claim to be related to - or even created by - dragons. They first began to arrive in the lands of the Rzentur en masse after hearing of Varlengeilt, the one true god. They venerated the idea of dragons as gods in Cannor, but none were to be found, until their arrival in Aelantir.\n\nExcellent excavators and with a predisposition for finding wealth, many of these kobolds devote themselves to Varlengeilt and gladly adopt the true faith. They display piety through labor and the excavation of the riches of the mountains and they hope to one day personally place these treasures at his feet and add them to his great hoard."

Instead they are a large breed of canine which has risen to prominence in recent years due to its thick, fluffy coat being well suited to the cold climes of the Northern Ynn and the Broken Sea.\n\nExtremely protective of their owners and those who earn their trust, drakehounds have been known to brutally savage any they think are harming their charges.

For nearly a century it showed no signs of life, and the faithful fell to despair as rulers fought each other for Drozmagog's hoard. Except for a few. A devoted group of veterans, returning from the War of the Great Dragon Host, founded the Order of Dolenmach which pursued the mission to safeguard Drozmagog's egg from any Ynnic incursion, hiding it for its safety among the foothills of the Ekyunimoy Mountains.\n\nThen, in the spring of 1443, the egg showed signs of life, eliciting great joy, but also eliciting great caution. The members of Dolenmach were priests and forward-thinkers, who realized that many would try to persuade the young hatchling and influence them negatively, or worse, try to subvert the Son of God to their own ends. And so the news were kept secret for a year, until the joy and commotion for His Divinity's hatching became too much to hide.\n\nAfterwards, Dolenmach kept fighting to ensure that Drozmagog's spawn was raised by morally upright guardians in a philosophically and culturally rich environment, overseeing the creation of the Ustajanky ik Drozma, or the Mouths of the Dragon, tasked with ensuring the Son of God would be capable of not only leading the faith but also of uniting it towards a new future."

Of those who fled, a large number moved to Mocvare due to the presence of the Great Dam of Mocbarja and established formal places of worship along its structure; including a great stone temple complex.\n\nThe High Priest of Svemel, when the core temple complex was completed, officially moved their office there.

The swamps and fens of Mocvare are shallow and filled with muck and rivergrass, making normal paddles ineffective. This resulted in the development of crude hand powered paddle boats.\n\nThis gnome, whose name was incomprehensible to our scholars, with local assistance, replaced the hand-crank with a chain powered by foot pedals, and attempted to “test” the device against the current of one of the Ynn's canals. Unfortunately, this is when we learned that gnomes are physically frail, and a “light current” to us, for them is apparently enough to pull them into the sluices that maintain the waterflow. Thankfully, since they expected to return, their notes were left on shore, and the advancements had some merit and left hands free to fish or, as has grown even more common, allowed people to leisurely travel along the River’s waters - so long as they keep away from the deeper parts!"

My hopes were dashed when I saw the local inhabitants: they looked at me like I was from another world, and ignored me when I pleaded for shelter. Each villager had a weapon in their home, and wouldn't hesitate to grab it and threaten me. Only the local priest, a Ruinborn named Vardha, was kind enough to offer me a loaf of bread and some shelter. He spoke to me in Dolindhan, and I couldn't understand most of what he said, beyond the fact I was in a realm called "Mocvare", and he was adamant I take a necklace with me and wear it before I departed.\n\nAs I thanked him, I turned around, giving one final look to the village. I felt in my heart that I couldn't blame its people for being wary of me.

It is rumoured to have existed in the waters around the city before its founding, but confirmed sightings can only be cited to 1018 AA, when a local nobleman spied a massive alligator with a blade of exquisite craftsmanship plunged into the beast’s skull. The masterfully made hilt and pommel gleamed regardless of weather or time, even as the beast's flesh had grown around it.\n\nMany over the years had tried to hunt the Beast, meeting only failure or death. It would only be learned upon the arrival of the Cannorians- alongside a few bloody close encounters by inquisitive gnomes, that the blade is some variety of Precursor spellblade. While no one is any closer to slaying the Beast and claiming its treasure, its sightings are rare, and those who seek to confront it usually end up dead. This has created an impressive legend with some even saying any who can pry the blade free from its skull earns the right to rule the entire Ynn."

The Rzentur had been pushing into the Ynn for decades, striking against its faithful in an effort to spread the dominion of their dragon god. Mocvare was targeted due to three reasons. The first was simple practicality. Any further expansion into Dolindhan realms was blocked by Mocvare, whose knights were more accustomed to fighting in the treacherous swampland and would have been a consistent thorn in the side for any circumventing force. The second was logistics: the Great Dam was a large crossing that allowed armies to move easily to the north or south bank of the mighty Ynn. Finally, there was faith: Mocvare's Great Dam was an important holy site to the Ynnic faithful and paramount to their morale.\n\nWhat followed was a brutal 15 year long siege, where the Rzentur would be forced to split their sieging force into three groups to encircle the north and south ends of the dam while also besieging Mocvare's city. The next 7 years would be marked with fierce Mocvarian resistance, with bands of faithful Ynnics from other realms fighting along the southern bank, breaking the siege no less than 13 different times. A two year armistice followed, which was broken when the Rzentur once again marshalled a great force to encircle the city. This time, however, the siege was backed with weapons inspired by Cannorians, primarily in the form of gunpowder explosives which were deployed to break the dam's formidable defences. In spite of this, it would only be in 1610 AA when the Rzentur’s fire ended the reign of the water of the Ynn, with the final capitulation of the city. Whether an act of mockery, or of honour, the 381 remaining defenders were allowed to board a funeral barge and be sent down the Ynn."

Recent times, however, have seen Epednar visit for a different - though equally warlike - purpose. In 1317, a powerful tribe of Epednar rode upon our fortress. Fearing the worst, Lord Dalatan I faced the oncoming horsemen with the too-few militiamen at his command. Thankfully, conflict did not break out that day, as instead - to the Selocshan surprise - the Buycev tribal leader Auvuro called for parley.\n\nUpon their meeting, Auvuro guaranteed to the Lord that he had no intent to slay the defenders - though both knew he could. Instead, the Epednar were here to talk business: his tribe wanted in on the spoils of the Ynnic wars, and wanted the Selocshan to advertise and legitimise their ‘services’. In exchange, he offered protection from other tribes of Epednar - or from Dalatan’s fellow Ynnics - a protection the township evidently could use.\n\nThus, Auvuro’s tribe were granted governance over all the lands west of Selocshana Fort. More than a century later, the Selocshan still look at the tent-city of the ‘Auvukonyr’ with distrust - though most admit; playing host to the greatest horsemen this side of the Ynn does have its upsides."

These local names mean the same thing: “Thunderglade”. No other place across the Ynn can boast such a population of Thunderbirds, and it has become a common spot of visitation for Selocshan Sarda and Epednar alike.

Better instead to sample Selocshan hospitality on the way to Adbrabohvi - so long as we convince them of that, we can enjoy first pickings of the Cannorian product.

In 1568 the Lord’s son, emulating his father, knelt in the current, praying for the flood’s end and struggling not to be swept away. He failed at both, and only by happenstance did the River’s Hands find him, unconscious and ill by the riverbank.\n\nThe disciples of Begga extended Her charity to the child, attempting to nurse him to health - until eventually, the Lord’s search led him to the roaming priests. Seeing what the Ynn had done to his beloved son, Lord Talvynn fell into a crisis of faith. He begged the River’s Hands for aid; they told him only prayer could save his child’s life. So pray Talvynn did - not to the Ynn, but to a foreign God - and a week later, his son miraculously awoke.\n\nPraising Begga, Talvynn became the first - and, for a long time, the only - Ynnic lord to convert to the Regent Court, breaking his oath to the River Priests of Adbrabohvi and further isolating his lordship from the disapproving Sarda. Though the other Ynnic realms denounced his conversion, many Selocshan had seen the good the River’s Hands had done, and tolerance of both Ynn Worship and the growing minority devoted to the Cannorian Pantheon became the norm within Selocshana."

That illusion was shattered during the Red Year, 1787, when Sarda found itself beset on all sides by enemies. The fortress of Selocshana saw itself facing a Cannorised army for the first time - and the modern Plumsteader forces were unlike any besiegers that had preceded them. The defection of the Auvukonyr at the promise of full integration into Plumsteader society and the subsequent surrender of the fortress marked the end of a near-millenium of home rule for the Selocshan, and saw the citizenry of that township become increasingly suspicious of any foreign influence.”\n\n-The New Sarda, Privinc Ostravyr, Sarda Demographer, 1844"

And mercenaries came to the city in droves, for the city had a reputation of long, stable contract periods that were mutually beneficial to both the mercenaries and the city."

In the chaos and confusion, the Vanbury Guild seized the chance to grab a foothold in the Devand and invaded Empkeios. The Mercenaries hired by Empkeios fled from the Cannorians, and those who stood their ground were slaughtered by Vanburyan soldiers with technologically advanced artificer weaponry. When they reached the walls of the city, Empkeios refused to surrender and mobilized the citizenry for the first time in centuries. What ensued was a grueling 2 year long siege, that ended with the burning of its great port, the destruction of a third of the city, and the loss of Empkeios's sovereignty. But the Vanbury guild suffered massive losses, and spent far more resources on the invasion than they had initially planned, and all they had to show for it was the conquest of a now partially ruined city. Many question if the victory was even worth the price."

Of course, no citizen of Keyolíon wanted to actually move inland. All this open interior space, however, was perfect for sugar plantations. The oligarchs of Keyolíon saw a golden opportunity, and established massive sugar plantations all across the interior, staffed by slaves bought from nearby Empkeios and made enormous profits. Eventually, Keylion would produce more sugar on a yearly basis than their parent city Oktikheion ever could and much of the economy would rely on the exporting of sugar."

These "Dranikites" where causing internal chaos and division within the city, and in a desperate bid to retain power and avoid internal conflict, Lokemeion exiled these radical philosophers and their followers, with the kylakas at the time, Eledas Akropolites stating “They can build their so called paradise, but not here. In Besolaki they will go.” The exiling of the Dranikites started a long standing trend in Lokemeion, where those that disagreed with the established order would be sent to Besolaki, which led to a population boom.

While the area around Apikhoxí was a prime location for a city, it was even better suited to agriculture, which the Ormam state saw as an opportunity, a cheap and permanent end to their food supply issues. The open door policy was put in place, where anyone that wanted to could enter Apikhoxí, grab a small plot of farmland for themselves, and as long as they protected it and stayed on it for 5 years, it would be theirs. As a consequence, many immigrants from across the Kheionai world, almost always of the lower classes, came to Apikhoxí hoping to build a better life for themselves.

While they were forced to work the fields, far from their friends and familly, their morale never wavered. Joined by constant shipments of convict laborers, Deyeion would become known as the prison colony. Deyeion’s early history was marked by constant revolts only being barely put down, with Degakheion often having to intervene directly. Eventually, after several generations, the descendants of rebels and criminals would wrestle control of the local government, reaching a compromise with Degakheion, recognizing their parent city as overlord while gaining much autonomy in return.

Soon, much of the population would fall in love with it, and even the state’s attempts at growing tea at home could not satisfy the demand.

Many a barbarian tribe would be defeated in battle, forced out of an area, and settlers would be sent to the area to secure it. This strategy worked well when dealing with the fractured and disunited Basobhar, but once Deyeion pushed deeper inland, it faced problems. An independent group of settlers headed deeper inland than the state had advised, near the land now known as Vexydhan, they were slaughtered. It was not a Basobhar tribe that had committed this atrocious act, but a mysterious group not well known to the Kheionai, the Mteibhar. Unlike the Basobhar, the Mteibhar were much more unified, and unlike the Basobhar, they could not be easily destroyed. The Mteibhar, seeing the Vexydhan settlers as a declaration of war by Deyeion, began agressively raiding and destroying any Deyeion settlements they could find, with one warband even reaching the walls of the city of Deyeion itself before being turned away. The deyeioni army, in turn, began an agressive campaign of burning every Mteibhara village they could find, and innovated new ways to counter the hit and run tactics the Mteibhara used. Eventually Deyeion, with the help of their allies, would push the Mteibhara back into their home valley, but the legacy of this attritional conflict remains in the new tactics and innovations Deyeion developed."

A shared trade policy, a common military, defined borders, and much more, the Échate league showed the Kheionai that banding together would lead to great benefits. When the great kheions of Alecand united in a great league of their own, it was apparent to many that the Échate League was what inspired them to do so.

Following the conclusion of the Wars of the Sorcerer-King, Saint Magda took it upon her own charitable soul to provide refuge to the innumerable widows of the war, many of whom would come from the devastated lands of Esmaria. This would inadvertently absorb a large portion of the sewing industry from the region and bring both peace and luxury to Magdalaire.\n\nUnder the banner of our dear Saint Magda, a unique culture of piety erupted from a spiritually stagnant population of urbanites. Such fervor would maintain the spirit of the city, unyielding even in subjugation and incorporation, leading to a new golden era for Magdalaire. This prosperity and prominence would allow the city limited autonomy even under a unified Anbennar, with the majority of power remaining in the hands of the local Wexonard and half-elf upper classes."

Therefore, what is now called the Old Bury was increasingly used only for political-administrative matters.

However, they do know where the name "Indel" came from, as do all their fellow citizens.\n\nThe great Indel was, depending on which Indlebury neighbourhood or township the person you're asking came from, a soldier, a mercenary, or a mage of great bravery and ability. Regardless of his background, two things ar clear: first, that he was a Wexonard, and second, that he single-handedly held off a bandit raid on what was to become Indlebury and so terrorized the brigands that had occupied what was to become the Old Bury that their leader simply surrendered after six hours.

After the rebuilding, the fire briefly faded into memory until a particularly idiotic Tellumite crier decided to use a pun and refer to it as the Kindlebury Incident. That horrible decision made the fire stick in people's minds throughout the Empire and caused the Emperor and the Grand Duke of Wex to take turns hitting their own foreheads with a thick book. More importantly, it set off a rash of folk-songs and both sober and inane speculation about why it burned.\n\nWas it malicious outside forces? Typically witless adventurers? Careless mages? Was it a bar brawl between Wexonards or the Lorentish or some other foreigners? Did someone light a match next to some flour, or did a cow knock over a lantern?

No matter where the people of Indalaberi originally came from, local or otherwise, they are all rude and stubborn. They have to be pestered even to move a crate from one end of the store to another to help their own mothers. Foreigners do not, in my experience, feel too out of place or unwelcome here simply because these Indalaberi people treat their own parents just as rudely."\n\n- From the writings of Nandaprabhan Janavarman, later Mayor of Bhuvauri, during his Anbennaric journey in the early 14th century."

These elves, more than any  other appreciate the history of our kind, and those that have created it. Whether it be Arda of Núrael, Munas Moonsinger, or Jaherian ta'Diranhriá, our retirees' zeal for these figures has not waned in the passing years.

This, of course, is due to the quiet serenity that rests upon the monastery like a gentle fog. Sure, there is some hustle and bustle as caretakers guide needing elves to-and-fro their activities for the day, but many others have no such ambitions. Often retirees' prefer games such as chess, meditation, or reading, private affairs that require only themselves and their minds. A great deal can be learnt from these aged people, when they do speak it is often profound and learned.

These masters, many of whom have trained for hundreds of years are able to exchange a variety of techniques and skills, tutoring the younger, though by no mean young, elves who arrive. Although weapons may be prohibited from being drawn upon the grounds, this has not stopped them from dutifully carrying their sheathed blades about the monastery. In practice they use wooden swords, striking hundreds, if not thousands of times a day. Even some, claiming to be remnants of Jaher’s eastern campaign, demonstrate prowess with merely their fists. When these masters spar it is in such a graceful manner it almost seems a dance, fluttering about each other in a flurry of movement.

For others more unfit, this climb is near-impossible. Far, far, from the world below, the mountain's steep climb and winding path lead to necessity from a Repose guide to get up. Those confident to go without often never find their way off the volcano, never making it to the Repose. For invaders, this spells near certain doom. If not advantageous for the Repose enough, the high walls surrounding it are made of firm elven architecture, densely packed bricks capable of resisting simple attacks. These natural defenses, in combination with the walls, have deterred many an invasion from weaker forces, and convinced those stronger that it may not be worth the trouble."

However, instead of ushering in dark times for the region, the rule of Drosten proved to be very fruitful for Deamóine due to the River-Reaver's intent on inviting other races to Esmaria - and most importantly among them for Deamóine, halflings.\n\nThese halfling immigrants not only helped rebuild Deamóine, but shared everything they had with the humans in need, including much of their farming expertise.

At first, we expected them to just be another threat for us to face eventually. But then their envoys came to our gates, and offered us their knowledge and goods in exchange for ours. And with this, our silence, which had lasted for hundreds of years, was shattered.\n\nSince we were the easternmost Sarda settlement on the Veykodan tributaries of the Ynn we became the main entry point for Cannorian goods, and merchants, Cannorian and Ynnic alike flocked to our lands, turning little isolated villages into prosperous towns and clearing out thousand-year old forests to make space for new settlements"

They also believe that one day, a heir of Rhovynuc will ride from Veykoda at the head of a great host of dashing rogues, and with that host he will shatter the nobility and bring liberty to all Ynnics.\n\nThe only reason why the Buykonyr were never punished for this belief is that such a story coming true was, in the eyes of nearly every Ynnic, simply impossible. But then King Jahanon of New Havoral did descend from the mountains at the head of an army of bandits, and thousands of rangers and hussars flocked to join his host, believing that despite being a human, Jahanon is Rhovynuc's heir.\n\nDue to the influence of the Buykonyr, who by this point owned Arvezl in all but name, we peacefully submitted to Jahanon, who renamed the place New Havorton and chose it as his capital, which Arvezl's riders boast about at every possible opportunity, even though Jahanon's kingdom eventually fell."

A54_born_from_the_fine_print_desc: "Crothán was born out of a technicality, a missing signature during the surrender of the Republic of Damescrown to Black Castanorian forces in 982 A.A.. The missing ink meant nothing for Castanorians and Crownsmen alike while meaning the world for us, even if we didn't know it yet.\n\nOur city of law remained a part of Damescrown for two whole centuries, when our most expert lawyers managed to inspect the treaty and found a golden opportunity for our independence. It took 10 years to prepare the case, and so it was in the year 1223 (with the Empire of Anbennar still formalising its internal divisions) when our brightest lawyer, Saulion "Goodelf" Saerossúir, brought our case to the Imperial Diet and Crothán became one of the first Free Cities of Anbennar under the protection of the Emperor. All by law and contract and without bloodshed, in the true Crownsman way... to the chagrin of our former overlords. \n\nNowadays the administrative folly that is the Empire is filled to the brim with these conflicting treaties. Entire new opportunities await in drawers to be found by someone who could draw upon their true potential. What are we doing with our city of law where merchants fight over loot and widows demand their husbands' fortunes? Once we reveal to the world what these documents have to offer, the fate of entire fiefdoms will be decided under the golden scales of our Hall."

A54_the_hall_of_golden_scales_desc: "The city council may gather at the Assembly, yet it is in the Hall of Golden Scales where the heart of Crothán lies. It is in this architectural wonder where the Crownsman famed contracts reach their peak: the main institute of law in the Damescrown. \nThe building itself is ancient: some say the foundations date back to the years before the Ash, while its gold and alabaster walls change between Castanorian, Esmarian, Damerian and Elven influences: Stout walls and dragon engravings mix with the arms of Anbennar, ornate Elven motifs decorate windows of Varainéy glass...  all dedicated to Nerat and the sacred Rule of Law. \n\nThis mixed building tradition grew into its own Crotháni style, centered around practicality and beauty, but it was during the rebuilding after the Corinite Wars when the Crotháni style truly shone, finally taking the center stage as entire patrician neighbourhoods were rebuilt following the trend born in the Hall of Golden Scales."

A54_the_sailmarket_desc: "Despite what some may say, Crothán wasn't built around its Ruby Hall. The city-state was once a small port with an artisan guild at its center, famed across the Dameshead for the quality of the sails they made. Growing with the years as the city turned into its modern law-centered self, the original Sailmarket turned from sails to various types of cloth, founding its own pole of attraction under the colossal shadow of Damescrown. With the centuries, the Sailmarket fair became a known meeting place for Esmarian fashion designers hoping to find revolutionary materials before their competitors, some going as far as equipping their party barges with sails made from Crotháni cloths to the horror and amazement of their fellow Esmarians. \n\nSailmarket cloth used for sails? Outrageous!"

A54_the_cannorian_net_desc: "The fame of the Crotháni lawyers, judges and prosecutors extends all the way to Pearlsedge and Verne while they are now being hired in both Escann and Lorent, and perhaps even further away. Our legal experts are hired when the powerful want the best defenders, and they rarely leave anything but a pleased customer on their leave: so much so that their legal advice is followed to the last detail. \n\nWith such a complex net of envoys travelling around Cannor, it is no wonder that some words slip by, a letter is dropped at a convenient location and bags of money find the right pockets. \n\nIt is all in the best interest of our clients, after all. Even if they do not know it yet."
