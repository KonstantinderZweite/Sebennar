  gronstunad_reclamation_of_the_mines_title:0 "Reclamation of the Mines"
  gronstunad_reclamation_of_the_mines_desc:0 "A hold’s strength lies not just in the hold alone, but in the riches of its mines and environs: the caverns and mining complexes of the Jade Mines, carved out over countless generations. These minerals have provided Grônstunad and the Jade Empire with much of its wealth from the fruit of Halanna’s bounty, but alas, they are inaccessible to us for the moment, overrun as they are with goblin, orcish, and hobgoblin filth. Whilst our enemies yet lurk in the caverns, Grônstunad shall never be safe, fortified or not.\n\nThe time has come to renew our offensive, and push ever onward; we will suffer the presence of these interlopers no longer! The Jade Mines, and our ancient vassal holds of Verkal Dromak and Tuwad-Dhûmankon, must be reclaimed and cleansed of the vermin that still seek to stymie our revival. There will be no mercy for the fiends, as they showed none to the Jade Dwarves of old. Slay them all: drive them out with axe and bolt, with spell and steel, until their bodies carpet the cavern floors. Push forward, ye sons and daughters of Dagrin, scions of Grônstunad renewed! A bloody business awaits us!"
  gronstunad_restore_the_holds_title:0 "Restore The Holds"
  gronstunad_restore_the_holds_desc:0 "The once loyal holds of Tuwad-Dhûmankon and Verkal Dromak have not fared any better than mighty Grônstunad in the millennia since their loss. The goblinoid wretches responsible found an empire of marble and jade and left it rubble and rust, wallowing in their own filth while not busy stabbing or enslaving each other. Thus, the joy of wrestling it from Hobgoblin hands is stained by seeing these once inspiring halls squandered.\n\nThough our hearts ache at this tragedy, we must not be discouraged from the task that we began at Grônstunad: to restore the great works of our ancestors for the future of all dwarvenkind. The lush gardens of the Second Domain will bloom again, and the Citadel of Dreamers will, once more, harness the powers of the arcane for our people. Picks and shovels, chaps! We’ve got work to do."
  gronstunad_tree_tapping_title:0 "Tree Tapping"
  gronstunad_tree_tapping_desc:0 "The Tree of Stone was, according to myth, the place where we sprung from Halanna’s womb, holiest amongst the holy places in any of our records, displaying a fertility unmatched anywhere else in the Serpentspine. This blessing was neglected for millennia since the Dark Days, its fruits reaped only by groveling goblinoids and wild beasts. No longer! Dwarven rule has returned to stay, and only we will enjoy the boons of its harvest. Our first homesteads in the region report unprecedented yields that could spell the end of the proverbial dependence on the surface for foodstuffs. To think our ancestors had to rely on Tuwad-Dhumakon, the Serpent’s Vale or human trade partners to fill their pantries, while the Tree was overflowing in this manner just beyond the rails!"

  gronstunad_resuming_production_title:0 "Resuming Production"
  gronstunad_resuming_production_desc:0 "The reclamation of Ovdal Kanzad and Hul-az-Krakazol has been a great boon for our nation in this time of struggles. Although our people can already see past their long-worn state and into a future where both holds thrive with life and activity, our interests must be more pragmatic for the short term, and focus on restoring any infrastructure that improves our ability to wage war. Unfortunately, millenia of abandonment and decay has left the fabled foundries and breweries of these holds in a much diminished state that will require more than just rubble sweeping.\n\nIf we wish to truly centralize production and have these holds supply our armies with artillery pieces and spirits, we must first stimulate their growth. A large population base and significant investments in urban planning and excavation would provide the titular sectors of both holds with all the auxiliary industries and expertise they require to scale production and meet demand. Alternatively, our growing realm holds many resources of great value: we could outsource production of metals and brewable plants to our other settlements and focus the holds on the final, artisanal steps of production, at least for the time being."
  gronstunad_hold_revitalization_title:0 "Hold Revitalization"
  gronstunad_hold_revitalization_desc:0 "We have made the ancient heart of the Jade Empire our capital, and it is rightly the centre of our rule; but our purpose is to restore the dwarven civilization of the Eastern Serpentspine, not merely a single hold. We are a positional people, defined by our places, the environments we impose upon. Like few others on Halann, we carve out our cultures hollow by hollow, marking them in solid rock for posterity. A new Age of Jade is upon us, of civic excellence and competition; under the auspices of the Empire, let the greatest cities of Halann grow here."

  gronstunad_reestablishing_the_vanguard_desc:0 "Of all the collaborative institutions which knitted together the various holds of the former Jade Empire, the Vanguard Of Many Halls was perhaps the most prestigious. Drawing from the soldiery and varied martial specialties of each of the Empire's constituent holds, the Vanguard pioneered a form of combined-arms warfare well ahead of its time. As our restored holds flourish, it is time once more to corral the many gifts of the dwarven people into such a force, a hammer to strike the anvil of our mass levy."
  gronstunad_food_to_march_on_title:0 "Food To March On"
  gronstunad_food_to_march_on_desc:0 "Rows and rows of stone shelves, lined with trenches and recesses for soil; vertical cave-farming on a scale seldom seen on Halann; an immense central chamber from whose walls gardens jut, vines thriving in the darkness. Even in the old Empire, Tuwad-Dhûmankon concerned itself with the question of growth. Only the foolish dismiss the Serpentspine as a place desolate of life, but it is true that life here must be cultivated just as assiduously as we dwarves cultivate our societies. As we have excavated, we have found more and more experimental farms, the incremental efforts of our ancestors to improve and diversify their crops.\n\nNow, in a chamber only recently uncovered, we have found a mushroom - rich and yellow-brown in colour, astonishingly prolific. Its taste is mild and nutty, pleasant if unexciting, but the sheer speed of its growth even in unfavourable conditions is immensely promising. Tuwad-Dhûmankon's municipal government has announced an ongoing effort to cultivate and optimize this mushroom, citing its possible use as a supplement to military rations."
  gronstunad_a_gem_from_a_boulder_title:0 "A Gem From A Boulder"
  gronstunad_a_gem_from_a_boulder_desc:0 "The legacy of Ovdal-az-Ân is easy to dismiss. As the lorekeepers and theologians of ancient dwarven civilization, their chosen medium was not a precious gem but granite. The vast, archival expanses of that storied hold are not the most obviously glamorous; extending as they do in all directions, one walks by row after row of dull grey stone inscribed with the teachings of the dwarves. Simple things refined may reach the sublime, however, and we will not allow Ovdal-az-Ân to go unhonoured.\n\nThus we search for the granite of granites, the deepest-veined stone. Just as the archivists of Ovdal-az-Ân were unceasing in their records, so will we comb every deposit of granite we can find. At the core of such places are found granites of extraordinary rarity, complex and profound in their depth. Like Ovdal-az-Ân, their beauty only grows in the viewing."

  gronstunad_guided_by_faith_title:0 "Guided By Faith"
  gronstunad_guided_by_faith_desc:0 "At the heart of all dwarven religion is history. Over thousands of years we have fought a struggle for memory: the memory of our ancestors, of our ancient gods, of things lost to us and then reclaimed. In the mammoth archives of Ovdal-az-Ân the scribes fought this struggle for thousands of years. They recorded arguments and agreements, the ebb and flow of dwarven thought, even as they were cut off from the world outside.\n\nIn the quest for memory, we have faced casualties. When one comes upon a caved-in wing of the archives of Ovdal-az-Ân, one mourns a hundred dead years. Yet we can learn an enormous amount from the men and women who now once again walk the archives. Carrying with them the aggregate wisdom of millennia of dwarven culture, the archivists are valuable in every institution of the Empire; when they speak with the voices of our ancient dead, we conquer time. "
  gronstunad_in_pursuit_of_the_amethyst_title:0 "In Pursuit Of The Amethyst"
  gronstunad_in_pursuit_of_the_amethyst_desc:0 "On that fateful day when the Dwarovkron shattered, Jade and Amethyst both were scattered among the endless halls of the Serpentspine. Through our tenacity and resolve we reclaimed the Jade, yet the Amethyst still lies somewhere abroad. No mere gem, the Amethyst carries with it the civic authority of Hul-az-Krakazol, the spirit of revelry which so long infused that ancient place. It must be found.\n\nUnfortunately, our scant records indicate that the Amethyst could be anywhere west of the Jade Mines, and we do not have the manpower for a search of that magnitude. We must seek out leads in the records of others: of brother holds or even monstrous powers. Perhaps it is in the spirit of the old Brewmaster Hold that we should require the help of friends, or at the very least the drunken secrets of a blabbermouth. At tavern tables throughout the Serpentspine, let our envoys keep an open ear."
  gronstunad_blasted_amber_title:0 "Blasted Amber"
  gronstunad_blasted_amber_desc:0 "Amber is among the most diverse and idiosyncratic of gems, and selecting only one to represent Ovdal Kanzad in the imperial crown has been a subjective and difficult affair. Almost a thousand exquisite specimens have survived initial inspection of the glassworker guilds in Vûrdriz-Ândriz, each of them suitable for working into a magnificent gem, yet none commands the awe and approval of this most tenacious populace. Perhaps, then, the answer is in the character of Ovdal Kanzad. Perhaps the people of the Cannonhold will accept no gem which they themselves have not blasted from the rock. "

  gronstunad_first_step_to_grandeur_title:0 "First Step To Grandeur"
  gronstunad_first_step_to_grandeur_desc:0 "Whilst great Grônstunad is ours once more, it is alas a pale and fleeting imitation of its former glory. Damage inflicted during the sieges, combined with millennia of decay and dilapidation, have all taken their toll on our ancestors’ work. Many areas of the hold have completely collapsed, are infested with dangerous creatures, or are otherwise still dangerously unfit for dwarven habitation thanks to the hobgoblins, who lacked the knowledge or simply the wherewithal to rectify any of these situations during their tenure. It falls to us, as Grônstunad’s reclaimers and rightful owners, to restore the Jade Hold. From crumbling shambles, let us rebuild the Eastern Hold of Aul-Dwarov into the shining jewel it deserves to be once again.\n\nIt is time to pull back the military engineers and the soldiers, and send forth the builders, the surveyors, and the masons. It is time to rebuild what was lost to the ravages of time and war, to replant Grônstunad’s great gardens anew, repair ancient fountains and roadways, and prove to the world that the glory of Grônstunad is not yet lost.."
  gronstunad_decorate_the_nobility_title:0 "Decorate The Nobility"
  gronstunad_decorate_the_nobility_desc:0 "Despite our great victories, to the outside world we are nothing but impudent adventurers. The great southern kingdoms, otherworldly in their opulent riches and ceremonies, see only thugs with matted beards. The old clans of other holds see little more than foolish children on a path to suicide against the Command. They find our claims to restore the Jade Empire laughable, but we know the truth - they are fearful. Fearful that we will prove ourselves more competent, more driven, more worthy than they. We have no claim or right to this place but that we pried these halls from the cold, dead hands of a hundred thousand hobgoblins.\n\nHowever, authority is but an illusion. Who would deny our claims if we dress like royalty, behave like royalty, and most crucially, wield power like royalty? At the apex of the First Jade Empire, our people were famed for their dress and appearance, embracing the many shades of Jade on their clothes, ornaments, and even skin..\n\nIf we wish for the world to respect our ambitions to revive the authority of Grônstunad, we would do well to honor these traditions. The means are already open to us. More skilled craftsmen join us by the day, drawn by our success and the conquests which have granted us control over the fabled deposits of the Jade Mines. Should we reward the old guard of adventurers, and equip them like the great ancestral warriors of old, our people would have little choice but to fall in line. Even the Raja would have to acknowledge emissaries bearing more jewels than himself."
  gronstunad_subdue_the_roots_title:0 "Subdue The Roots"
  gronstunad_subdue_the_roots_desc:0 "For over three thousand years, Grônstunad ruled over the Jade Empire, which stretched from the eastern outpost at Verkal Dromak to the Oza tunnel that bridges the gap between the Tree of Stone and Middle Dwarovar. And stretch it did, for this empire had rotted roots: control beyond the grand dwarovrod tunnels was tenuous at best, surrounded in every direction by a vast hive-like network of unmapped caverns. These sunless expanses were home to uncountable numbers of goblins, always prowling the outskirts of Jade control, until finally marshalled by the thrice damned Grimka the Despoiler into a final goblintide that swallowed the jade dwarves.\n\nIf we wish to amend the errors of the past, our control over the underground must be absolute: allowing our enemies to fester at our backs will surely again end in disaster. We don't have the means to do that yet, however. Our numbers are too few, spread thin just as in the old empire, and worn down by constant years of war against the Command and wild goblin tribes. Now, though, our growing power has attracted the attention of all the dwarven diaspora throughout Rahen, particularly that of one of the largest communities of our kin: the Peridot dwarves. Should we earn their good graces, they could encourage their people to return to their ancestral homeland - for good this time."
  gronstunad_clear_the_roads_title:0 "Clear The Roads"
  gronstunad_clear_the_roads_desc:0 "When it comes to ruling an empire, one of the greatest challenges comes from distance. Distance affects how quickly our orders and decrees reach our population, and in turn their petitions to us. It also is a pivotal element for the economic welfare of our realm: we may be able to produce the finest goods in Haless, but this means little if the final price is inflated beyond affording by an endless chain of middlemen and carriers - not to mention the strategic necessity of moving our troops swiftly wherever they may be needed.\n\nOther great empires relied on great rivers to solve this, which are absent in the Serpentspine. But the Dwarovrod is a marvel of engineering that quite literally kept Aul-Dwarov together, possibly the greatest mortal-made road in existence even in its now-ruined state..\n\nThe means to gain more from the Dwarovrod and move past the paradigm of distance lie at our feet, literally: the rails we have followed this whole time were no mere technical extravagance of ancient Aul-Dwarov. With enough resources and some retooling of our forges, we could use these to guide metallic wagons with massive load bearing capabilities, far superior to river barges or regular carts. We could expect our wares to cost next to nothing to transport, our troops to reach their posts with nary a delay, and our orders to be carried out expeditiously.\n\nHowever, such increased traffic is bound to draw unwanted attention. There is always the occasional stray goblin band that sneaks their way through a random cave passage, typical malcontents or foul players amongst cartels or clans. We should establish permanent garrisons along the Dwarovrod’s vital arteries, bolstering our authority in the process."
  gronstunad_life_of_vibrance_title:0 "Life Of Vibrance"
  gronstunad_life_of_vibrance_desc:0 "We dwarves are often unfairly dismissed as dour and drab, our stubborn resilience mistaken for stolidity. For our Raheni subjects, it is thus a pleasant surprise that we should prove so hungry for their textiles, the gorgeous patterns and brilliant colors of their traditional fashions. The emergent wealthy elites of our holds compete to drape themselves in finery: elegant pleated salwars accented with reflective golden detailing, calf-length kurtas flecked with jade, saris in hues of yellow and orange brilliant enough for even the darkest caverns.\n\nOur dwarven craftsmen are eagerly embracing this exuberant use of colour, fusing Raheni trends with the ancient clothing we see in the excavated murals of our ancient past. Properly fostered, a native dwarven fashion industry will help our warriors to slay and our nobles to serve."
  gronstunad_expand_our_operations_title:0 "Expand Our Operations"
  gronstunad_expand_our_operations_desc:0 "Until recently our economic efforts have been focused largely on our holds, the civic and cultural centres of dwarven life. The boisterous urban elite which has so rapidly flowered since the reclamation now turn their gaze outwards, eager for opportunities which will allow them to outcompete their neighbours. Their mood is eager, utopian and expansionist; they see no reason why prosperity cannot spread wherever we can lay rails. Buoyed by this new economic boom, entire new auxiliary industries are springing up. In one neighbourhood of Grônstunad, a cluster of independent forges exist purely to smith the nails with which mine carts are assembled; the standard minimum order is for ten thousand."

  gronstunad_establishing_a_standard_title:0 "Establishing A Standard"
  gronstunad_establishing_a_standard_desc:0 "In the chaos and clamour of the Reclamation, each restored hold flew its own flag and established its own tariffs and excise. Arrangements have been similarly ad hoc as we expand on the surface: sometimes it seems that practically every township has its own currency. Though our various subjects profess their loyalty, they are still more local than imperial. None of this will do if we are to command loyalty and bring lasting prosperity to our Second Jade Empire.\n\nThe task is extensive. Beyond the establishment of universal weights and measures, the minting of a new currency will require enormous initial outlay. Our vast reserves of jade make it the most promising medium, but we then have to exchange the old currencies and standards for our new ones. Finally, we need administrators with the authority to enforce the new standard. Such measures are not merely a question of economics: imperial merchants who buy and sell under our colours represent our values. Soon, the Jade Standard will signify prosperity itself."
  gronstunad_ascending_the_spire_title:0 "Ascending The Spire"
  gronstunad_ascending_the_spire_desc:0 "At the western tip of the Jade Mines lies the Emerald Spire, a column of rock half-embedded in the wall of an immense cavern, glittering with innumerable natural emeralds. In our search for a metonymic gem to represent the Emerald Dwarves, it is an obvious choice, and it is now firmly under our control.\n\nThe largest solid emerald formations appear to be near the very top, and it is among these that we hope to find the highest-value emeralds. As accessing these deposits will require extensive scaffolding and painstaking labour, we will need a well-established mining operation before we begin."

  gronstunad_supplied_by_experience_title:0 "Supplied By Experience"
  gronstunad_supplied_by_experience_desc:0 "As our mining operations grow in scale and complexity, a whole host of auxiliary professions spring up to enable them. Between the forges and workshops which supply tools to our mining operations, the wholesale markets which sell their product and the mines themselves, a veritable army of skilled logisticians is emerging. The sole specialty of such clerks is ensuring that these myriad goods arrive where they should, when they should.\n\nIt is logisticians such as these who increasingly press the Imperial government to improve our industrial infrastructure. Every hour which is shaved from the average delivery time between the Emerald Spire and Grônstunad compounds our productivity, and the faster we can load and unload goods at each end, the more profit there is to be had. Slow, methodical optimizations such as these are the foundation of dwarven genius, the iterative processes upon which our Empire is built."
  gronstunad_vibrant_proliferation_title:0 "Vibrant Proliferation"
  gronstunad_vibrant_proliferation_desc:0 "As our logisticians and prospectors dig ever deeper and uncover ever more fecund deposits of precious gems, we enjoy an embarrassment of riches. The sheer quantity of our production threatens to flood the market, but we cannot pedal backwards; too much of the Empire relies upon these vital industries.\n\nWhere we cannot restrict supply, let us expand demand, and take full advantage of the burgeoning rich of our subject nations. Our improved infrastructure and technology have massively reduced the overhead for lower-quality ores; in cities across Rahen, let petty merchants, clerks and laundresses adorn themselves with jewellery as dazzling as Raheni silks. At the same time, let us retool a mine or three towards the acquisition of truly fabulous gems, and with the judicious outlay of gifts spur a new luxury craze, fit for the wealthiest monarchs in Haless."

As the rejuvenated rail system brings goods, capital and people from one end of the Mines to the other with astonishing speed and reliability, dwarves who in their youth foraged mushrooms in the dark now preside over vast networks of mined wealth, boasting a mansion in every Hold.\n\nThus is the imperial vow fulfilled; ease beyond imagining, and the restoration of dwarven culture at its very height. We have traced the river of wealth to its source - we need now but drink our fill."

  gronstunad_securing_a_foothold_desc:0 "In 2419 BA, Grônstunad, ancient capital of the Jade Empire, second only to Amldihr during the time of Aul-Dwarov, greatest and most storied hold of the East Serpentspine, fell to the hobgoblin hordes. Since then, these monsters have lurked within its remains, lording over the remnants of the Jade Empire, staining the honour of all dwarvenkind.\n\nNo longer. Victory is ours, and Grônstunad has been reclaimed from the vile hobgoblins that have defiled its halls for so long! Yet there is still much more to be done. Our position in the Jade Mines is still tenuous at best, and hobgoblin warbands and their orcish and goblin lackeys continue to assail us on all sides with renewed vigour. We cannot falter now - not when we have fought so hard, and bled so much to reclaim our rightful home from the scum that squatted within.\n\nWe will weather this storm as we dwarves have always done. We must dig in, refortify the hold’s crumbling walls, and recruit more into the shieldwall, before striking out once more. Our butchers’ work is not yet done, and by the time we are finished with our bloody task, our axe-arms will ache from overuse! "
  gronstunad_they_came_from_behind_title:0 "They Came From Behind"
  gronstunad_they_came_from_behind_desc:0 "The Jade Mines have three main entrances that any invader must surmount in order to threaten our fair hold: the great gates of the Grônrod leading south into Shamakhad, the hold of Verkal Dromak facing the Demon Hills to the east, and the Grôn Tunad linking the Jade Mines to the Tree of Stone to the west. Of these routes, the most dangerous for now remains the Grôn Tunad: the Tree of Stone is home to untold multitudes of goblins who continue to harass us through these tunnels, and who could easily be marshalled under a new Goblintide to descend upon the Jade Mines once again.\n\nThis must not be permitted to happen. We will begin construction of a series of heavy and extensive fortifications on the northern end of the Grôn Tunad to block any access from the south. If the goblins attempt to attack us once again, they will break upon our new fortresses like water upon rocks."
  gronstunad_take_the_trunk_title:0 "Take The Trunk"
  gronstunad_take_the_trunk_desc:0 "Wealthy as the Jade mines may be, our ambitions must reach further if we wish to endure: the humblest of the common dwarf's needs, food, is still an overpriced commodity. Our people can't feed on gemstones and ore and neither the dilapidated gardens of Tuwad Dhumakon nor the war-torn lands of Shamakad are yet restored enough to meet our needs...\n\nThe solution to this problem lies southwest, in the Tree of Stone: once a core part of the Jade Empire, it is now an untamed wildland, ripe for any enterprising dwarf to make a living, provided they be willing to slay a thousand axedwarves’ share of goblins. Life thrives unrestricted in those vast caverns: enough serpentbloom to feed an empire and vast untapped mineral reserves which the dwarves of old judged too risky to extract, a sign of prudence we cannot afford. Best of all, unlike the surface the tunnels lack a formal rulere, so annexing these caverns would be simply a test of our ability to control them.\n\nBringing civilization back into these tunnels will require us to establish strong bases of operation. The ancient homes of our forefathers shall be perfect for this endeavor: Ovdal-az-Ân, the Hold of One, deprecated by the contemptible goblin Dak, and Hul-az-Krakazol, the Hall of the Brewmasters, to which many of our original company of the Axebellow Cartel can trace their lineage.

Scholars now debate many of the fundamentals of life and the creeds preached by High Philosophy’s various schools.

It has been ceaseless, thankless work, a chamber at a time, a single pair of hands restoring centuries of deprecated mason’s craft. Finally, though, we have glimpses of the picture the old tales tell of the glory of our ancestors: endless rows of tower-tall pillars, colossal walls of polished, engraved stone for miles and miles, artworks and reliefs so rich and exquisite as to make the High-Gods mural a mere journeyman’s entry work, vaults and ceilings laden with gemstones so that they humble the night sky it imitates and surpasses.\n\nThese and many more are the works of our subjects, the care of the mason, the artistry of the carver and the toil of the miner, and just as they mold rock, they brand minds. Any that visit our halls of stone are struck with amazement at the wonders of the underground, surpassing any sight the surface world can display. Many have doubted our promises of wealth and livelihood, or have questioned the merits of our hard earned victories in battle, but none can deny the splendor of the halls of Grônstunad, high-kingdom under the mountain. No querulous words or petty fears remain in the hearts and minds of our kin: the Age of Reclamation is over, and the rebirth of the Dwarovar begins.\nAll, at last, return home."

Tales of our resurgence now echo across the breadth of Haless, told not just among our kin but whispered with awe by all peoples.

The cities languish after a dozen sacks, and the people of the countryside live in constant fear that the next campaign to liberate their people might also spell the people’s demise. Though it hurts our pride, the part we played in this destruction is great enough to constitute a debt owed to the people of the Ruin Kingdoms, in addition to our duty as new overlords of these lands.\n\nUltimately, Shamakhad needs time and labor to be restored, but fortunately we have an excellent substitute: gold. With our vault overflowing with riches, we can skim some off the top of the treasure piles to aid in reconstruction: every piece of gold we send is another our subject realms won't have to collect from their own bereaved people, and every coin a peasant keeps may help their children towards a good marriage, pay for farm tools, offer leeway to keep more grain from sale, or more heads of cattle to grow instead of being sent to slaughter.\n\nWith care and time, this restoration will also serve as proof of our legitimacy: not merely as conquerors, but as just and enlightened liberators.

Such barbarism ignores that an Empire is a thesis, an argument for a specific way of life. The authority of an Empire thus derives from the quality of the argument it asserts and from the nobility, civic tradition and cultural refinement of the lifestyle it champions.\n\nIn Northern Rahen, the equivalent to our Jade Empire is undoubtedly the prosperous rule of the Nadimraj, the apex of their political and cultural achievement. In restoring the title, we restore the promise: that its people will live in wealth and peace, their culture flowering without restraint. Such a gift cannot but serve to bind our peoples together in perpetuity."

Long have we been welcomed to the tables of these noble folk, and as our Jade Empire rises in power and influence, they remain natural and ancient friends.\n\nThese ties are worth strengthening.

To encourage migration, the Charter offers numerous exemptions and rights for the first twenty years of settlement: free movement of people and goods, poll and consumption tax exemption, leeway on census records, draft immunity, significantly reduced legal hurdles or fees on matters such as land claims, guild establishment, common land usage, weapon carry, and a mile-long number of dispositions that simply scream “Move to Grônstunad, it's the best deal you’ll ever get”.\n\nAlthough it will cost us initially, these gracious terms won't last that long - unlike the migrants, their tools, knowledge, savings and extended families.

He had been toiling away ever since, searching reserves of granite for a worthy piece of stone. Working away in a cavern not far from Ovdal-az-Ân, he pulled out a piece; it took another with it, the heavy rock falling on his head. Being a hard-headed dwarf, it didn't mean a thing to him - but it surely did take his attention from the stone in his hand. He looked at the vaguely dwarf-like shaped granite; curious , he picked it up. Grâord was a pious dwarf, and upon closer inspection he also saw the figure of Dagrin resembled in the stone's silhouette, though it was yet unrefined. He took it upon himself to bring it towards glory. Once Grâord was finished, he brought it to his commissioner - who promptly threw him out. A simple gem like that, no matter its shape, wasn't good enough to represent all the granite dwarves. Being a dwarf with great foresight he did not rid himself of the Dagrin granite; instead he went into a tavern and showed it off to all his companions. Soon rumours spread across the realm, speaking of a small gem shaped exactly like Dagrin was described in legend. All were certain it was a sign; Grâord was brought back so he could hand in the stone, which was promptly added onto the crown.

Our dwarven explorers went forth, outfitted with climbing gear, pickaxes and provisions. At first they simply walked, breathlessly admiring the beauty of this naturally-formed structure. Then they reached a point at which the ledges narrowed too tight, so they brought out rope and choks and began their ascent. They were not tasked with getting to the very top, but something radiant kept grabbing their attention, glimmering at the Spire’s apex. Few hurdles were encountered along the way and after a climb, interrupted by a few stops to rest, everyone safely reached the top. There they found an Emerald of incredible quality: immediately the miners could tell it was this gem that had so persistently caught the light from their torches and candles - it shone bright even now. One dwarf was selected to break the gem from the rock: he did so with the utmost precision, as if he was possessed by the spirit of Halanna, unwilling to see her most precious treasure smashed. Having acquired the gem they hurriedly descended and brought it to us, so it could be put into our gracious crown in honour of Tuwad-Dhûmankon."

The throne room he occupies is filled with treasures of all kinds: masterfully crafted dwarven armour, many swords, hand axes and even guns. Running to the High Lord’s feet is a silken carpet of great quality, embroidered with golden thread. Everything is gathered in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] domain. In the east the sounds of foundries sound like a hum of horns, workers smelting down each and every precious ore which is gathered throughout the mountain. Those ores are brought from across the Empire by a rail system which exceeds even the original left here for him by his ancestors. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] hears the steam engines making their way through the city on those very rails, smells the sweet smoke coming from their chimneys; for a moment [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] thinks there might be a little too much smoke, but comes to the conclusion it's nothing a dwarf cannot withstand.\n\nTo the west [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] can hear the smithies hammering away, capable of producing hundreds of suits of shining armor a day. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] can hear the striking of metal on metal and smell the gunpowder as the Grônstunad Vanguard relentlessly train, working off their rust with discipline and determination. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] hears the drillmasters shouting, their tactics devised in such a way that every single dwarf recruited from the Jade Empire's other holds fits perfectly into the army structure and compliments the others.\n\nAfter listening to the sweet sounds of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] empire running like a well-oiled machine, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] steps into the hall of government. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] is swarmed by his advisors, each offering details of newly-launched mining operations or presenting budget reports for those already established. They speak in such detail that [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] can hear all the prospectors mining through the hard dense rock of the tree of stone and jade mines. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] can hear their cheers when they run into a vein and [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] can taste the beer they drink after another day working in our glorious empire. The advisors don’t stop there: they tell [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] how the forges in Ovdal Kanzad, Grôzumdihr, Ovdal-az-Ân, and Hul-Az-Krakazol are strained to full capacity and will need an expansion; the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] writes out a decree, and the responsible advisors make haste to fulfill it. The last report to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is that the processing of raw materials is exceeding demand; that outgoing trade routes are needed to the kingdoms of Rahen under our rule. The High Lord writes another decree and dismisses the last few remaining officials.

[Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] looked back at the surface of the table. The thing itself was solid stone, but it projected a spectral map of the Empire a finger's-breadth or so above its surface. [Root.Monarch.GetName] frowned - the map was flickering at one corner, where the crown lay. "Oh, the damestear…" But there was nowhere else to put it, so [Root.Monarch.SheHe] let it be.\n\nA whirling pageant of niceties; that was life at the apex of the Jade Empire, intertwined as it was with a dozen ancient kingdoms, each worthy of their own deference, each an honored member of the imperial family. It was a common joke at Court that the Empire ran itself, but sometimes [Root.Monarch.GetName] found that frighteningly true; a system so much larger than [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]self, so impossible to completely comprehend. \n\nA gem for each of the holds. A gem for the lands beyond the Serpentspine. The borders of the Second Jade Empire now exceeded those of the First, and there were no old tunnels at the depths where they now dug. No more precedent for the dwarves to reclaim.\n\nInstead, this new thing; this hybrid of surface and spine. A new kind of dwarven authority, wielded in the name of material prosperity on behalf of a population now mostly human. \n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] flexed [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] neck again.

Upon a small stone pedestal sits the crown of the Jade Empire, as if it were a bookend or a spoon. There is nobody else in the room.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] has been here for a good twenty minutes, and it is likely that the wait will stretch to an hour or more. The machinery of an event is rarely much fussed with the attention span of its actors, and today there is much pomp to be had, introductions and celebrations. The foolish will argue the coronation ceremony is nothing, these fabrics and jewels and ritualized movements. But [Root.Monarch.GetName] knows they are everything.\n\nThe crown is astonishingly delicate. Mithril catches the light in an almost playful way, as if the light is pleased to be upon it; it gambols, dances. The silvery-white is a classic accompaniment to jade, one of the fundamental harmonies of ancient dwarven art. The Mithril has been worked to evoke the almost crystal structure of the Jade Mines, a rigid, swirling array of voids which meet in odd places, inviting something, missing something.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] cannot help it. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] reaches out and grasps the crown, places it on [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] head. It is too light, of course. This is the nature of a dwarven crown; it has the form of the realm it represents. It is a work of sacred metonymy, taking on the desires and fears of the polity for which it stands.

We have not heeded such warnings, deciding instead to methodically explore and catalogue these places. One recent expedition has proven fruitful indeed. The force we sent went in prepared for a fight, boasting sleeper mages, heavily armored axemen and riflemen with precision-enhancing monocles. Even still, they were unprepared for the traps - so many treacherous traps. Magical arrows, strange exploding runes carved into the ground, pitfalls - but that was not the worst part. The halls through which they were passing must have been cursed, because it seemed they were walking in circles, sometimes falling for the same trap a different dwarf only recently lost his life to. This went on until there were just a few explorers remaining. Finally one of the sleepers stirred; in their meditations, they had surmised the odd layout of the place. They led the group to the heart of the ruins, where the expedition found a blue gem of a strange quality none of them recognized. Upon closer examination, the sleeper disabled the traps guarding it and began a short examination. He swiftly came to the conclusion that it was damestear and proclaimed it would be a great representation of the dwarves of Verkal Dromak. On their path back, none further lost their lives - with the loot they secured, they have had the surface of the ruin rebuilt into a proper dwarven tomb to honor those who lost their lives."
