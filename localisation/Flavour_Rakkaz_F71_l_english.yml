 F71_rally_the_riders_title:0 "Rally the Riders"
 F71_rally_the_riders_desc:0 "For our struggle against Grizaka, we will need more than mere warriors to slay her and take the lands bound to her claim. By cleverly persuading the roaming tribes of our lands to join our cause, and calling forth our Hyena Riders to war, we shall bloodily break her hordes and defeat Grizaka decisively."

 F71_secure_our_holdings_title:0 "Secure Our Holdings"
 F71_secure_our_holdings_desc:0 "Our war against Grizaka has concluded, yet the work to secure our lasting victory has only begun. Our wounds must be cleansed, our new lands must be broken in, and our capital must be turned into a proper center of our realm to demonstrate to all that these victories are only the beginning."

 F71_the_weakling_packs_title:0 "The Weakling Packs"
 F71_the_weakling_packs_desc:0 "Kogzalla. Kograffa. These two packs have always skulked at the edges of the massacres, never actually dealing the blows themselves, never fully committing to the might of the Xhaz. Cowardly. Pathetic. Weak.\n\nIt is time to bring them under our reign and show them how a true Gnoll rules, with flame and strength."

 F71_fieldstalker_lords_title:0 "Fieldstalker Lords"
 F71_fieldstalker_lords_desc:0 "Quaint. Deluded. Weak. Thus can our kin to the east best be described. By turning their back on the powers granted by the voices below and keeping to the weakling beliefs of our ancestors they have chosen to be left behind on the ash heap of history. It is upon us to take up the reins, dispose of their deluded leaders in our pyres and show their packs a more gloriously bloody future."

 F71_a_hollow_claim_title:0 "A Hollow Claim"
 F71_a_hollow_claim_desc:0 "The time is near. Our forces have ensnared the Gnollakaz forces into a war they can not win. Whether alone or not, we have tipped the scales in our favor. Grizaka is the last one left standing among our many enemies. Let us show her to the pyre, shall we? A fitting end for one who dared to proclaim herself empress of all our kind."

 F71_can_you_hear_them_title:0 "Can You Hear Them"
 F71_can_you_hear_them_desc:0 "Can you hear the voices too? The voices baying for blood? Crying out for the succor of desolation? Begging for the ruin of all of these lands before us? The lands of those that cower before us?\n\nThe voices from Mazu Makhara have made it abundantly clear. The pyres shall be lit. Our lines shall be set. A sign. A signal. It is time to burn them all."

 F71_seizing_sacrifices_title:0 "Seizing Sacrifices"
 F71_seizing_sacrifices_desc:0 "Residing aside us for millennia, the people of the Echenka have always been fine tools for our people to employ in any efforts we had no inclination to undertake ourselves. Sometimes they have forgotten this, and other times they have attempted to flee from their fate. And now we have a new need for them. The warlocks need more sacrifices, and we need more slaves and fighters. The Echenka should be grateful we shall grant them this new purpose."

 F71_echenka_serfdom_title:0 "Echenka Serfdom"
 F71_echenka_serfdom_desc:0 "For the longest time we were content to leave the Echenka to their own devices, as long as the tributes kept arriving on time. But the time for malign neglect has passed. Our warlocks require a steadily increasing source of sacrifices and the Echenka are just that. By firmly establishing control in the outlying border territories inhabited by them and investing in those benighted lands, we can ensure a constant influx of kerhos - or slaves as the humans call them - sufficient to not only sate the immense hunger of the sacrificial pyres but also a healthy surplus we can sell for profit."

 F71_a_helping_hand_title:0 "A Helping Hand"
 F71_a_helping_hand_desc:0 "Up on her lofty throne, Grizaka would think she has nothing to fear from us. After all, why be afraid when you have friends in many places that can aid you against whatever ills trouble you?\n\nIt certainly is unfortunate for her that we have decided to undermine her support. The Warlocks that we have entertained in their whims have developed a cunning plan that will make Gnollakaz recklessly overstep their bounds while at the same time prevent them from realizing the depth of isolation this will lead them into. Set forth to the slave pits. It is time to even the odds in our favor."

 F71_a_debt_repaid_title:0 "A Debt Repaid"
 F71_a_debt_repaid_desc:0 "It appears that the Warlocks’ help had not come without a cost. Now they come before us, asking that this cost be repaid with the official endorsement of their new role in our realm. They desire to subsume any mage organizations within our land and to lead the charge in all matters magical. Perhaps we should let this be. After all, they have proven their worth, and any further costs wouldn't be that high. Right?"

 F71_promise_of_power_title:0 "Promise Of Power"
 F71_promise_of_power_desc:0 "The Warlocks have come to us with a request: in order to continue the work they do and give us further power, they would need to expand their works as well as require less oversight on their practices. By providing them the needed areas for their demonic works to be created, they tell us, we shall receive untold power and sage advice from the greatest fiends they may summon and bring us eternal glory."

 F71_the_cursed_ruins_title:0 "The Cursed Ruins"
 F71_the_cursed_ruins_desc:0 "Mazu Makhara. A grand name for the desolate ruins that lie within our lands. Voices can be heard from within promising of power and ruin both, and the Warlocks of our pack have always been keen to have access to this site. They have come to us again before our corpse throne, asking for another favor: they wish for the cursed ruins to be restored to at least a semblance of their former glory. To build upon and expand the settlement that dwells near its mouth, to revitalize the center of their practices, their strength. In turn, they shall increase their efforts there to show us a new glorious future."

 F71_the_profane_gift_title:0 "The Profane Gift"
 F71_the_profane_gift_desc:0 "There has been a new idea brought to us by the Warlocks, one that if successful can be a monumental boon to our army. The hyenas our riders have used for so long to ride to war could be…enhanced. Binding demons and thus, our warlocks say, empowering these new mounts, they could become the spearhead of any advancing force, to crush and demoralize our foes."

 F71_a_silent_strike_title:0 "A Silent Strike"
 F71_a_silent_strike_desc:0 "Our plots. Our schemes. All are drawing to their climax. Those leading the pack know not of the true power that awaits. Of the true strength that comes from our bond to that which lays beyond. The voices below. The call. A single strike, aimed at the top, ready to be executed at a single moment. One strike. One silent strike is all we need to take over. To become the undisputed power behind the throne. For the rule of the Warlocks to truly begin."

 F71_rakhors_legacy_title:0 "Rakhor's Legacy"
 F71_rakhors_legacy_desc:0 "Rakhor. Our exalted spiritual founder. Our paragon of what a Gnoll should be. A Gnoll who united the savannah of Gol through demonic flames and cackling madness. Though he died burning due to the capricious whims of the Khet, his actions still shape our beliefs to this very day. Once we, too, have reunited the lands of Gol, we shall finish what Rakhor started, and wear the skins of those haughty catlings as ornaments."

 F71_rakhors_revenge_title:0 "Rakhor's Revenge"
 F71_rakhors_revenge_desc:0 "We march against Kheterata. Their lands, scorched by demon flame and ravaged. Their people, fed to the pyres. Their wealth, ours to behold. We who have bonded with the voices have fulfilled their promise. We shall finish what Rakhor started. We shall burn Kheterata to soot and ash, and laugh at what desolation remains."

 F71_a_land_divided_title:0 "A Land Divided..."
 F71_a_land_divided_desc:0 "The lands to the south are divided. Bickering among themselves like the fools they are, unaware of their true status as cattle. As ours. With the cackling of our voices rising as we confront them with the fires of our demonic might, they shall learn soon enough of their true place: beneath our feet."

 F71_easily_exploited_title:0 "...Is Easily Exploited"
 F71_easily_exploited_desc:0 "The trivial squabbles of the many human petty kings beyond the mountains have left their lands weak and divided. With Horashesh gridlocked between ineffectual remnants of bygone Kheteratan dominion yearning for the past and vainglorious tribal lordlings whose ambitions far exceed their grasp, we have gladly accepted such an open invitation to plunder their riches and grow fat on the spoils. Turning their people into our slaves to feed the insatiable hunger of our dark patrons is our right as conquerors.\n\nAs they thought it wise to fight each other instead of keeping us out of their lands, let them continue to slaughter each other, this time for our amusement."

 F71_weakness_of_faith_title:0 "Weakness of Faith"
 F71_weakness_of_faith_desc:0 "The Horasheshi have always been weak in body as well as in spirit. Already in the long gone times of the second Xhaz, the Blighted Xhaz, they eagerly took up arms against their brethren in return for paltry rewards. And their faith, if one can call that hodgepodge of local superstitions and misremembered fragments of other beliefs such, has proven no match to the undeniable power of our patrons. The many tribes of Horashesh have eagerly turned their back on their traditions and embraced our superior ways, accepting their place as our servants in the grander scheme of things."

 F71_they_speak_again_title:0 "They Speak Again"
 F71_they_speak_again_desc:0 "The voices of Mazu Makhara have once been mighty, but now are mere whispers within the back of one's head, weakening the more one strays from the ruins. If we wish to bring forth the new age under our rule, we shall first need to restore their former strength and thus increase the range within which we can deploy their power beyond these cursed lands. We shall link these ruins to our rituals, so that whenever we light the pyres and bring forth the sacrifices, Mazu Makhara will surge in power once more as the central hub of a web of agony."

 F71_source_of_power_title:0 "Source Of Power"
 F71_source_of_power_desc:0 "The foolish human mages of Kheterata have been sitting on an enormous fount of arcane power for centuries and have done nothing worthwhile with it. This ends now. We have turned the tower of Muhaqaar and its rich damestear mines into the dark heart of our necromantic endeavors. Here our warlock necromancers can conduct their gory experiments to their foul heart’s content. Let the waters of lake Nirakhet turn red with the offal of their trials."

 F71_broken_spirit_title:0 "Broken Spirit"
 F71_broken_spirit_desc:0 "The human inhabitants of Khetapera are a stubborn, prideful lot. For far too long they have boasted of their successes in fending off the attempts of our ancestors to reconnect the many gnollish packs which have been divided by the creation of the Mothers Sorrow.  And none are more conceited than the people of Samsumbat, descendants of Kheteratan slaves who took advantage of the weakness of their masters to overthrow them. But now they have new masters, and if there is one thing we gnolls excel at, it is to break the spirits of insolent kerhos."

 F71_channeling_suffering_title:0 "Channeling Suffering"
 F71_channeling_suffering_desc:0 "Our constant efforts have paid off! The continuous sacrifices performed by our kult priests have saturated the spiritual essence of our main ritual sites with a miasma of suffering, drenching the very ground and air around the fighting pits and sacrificial pyres with the agony of their victims. These acts have not gone unnoticed and we have been blessed by the voices beyond. Those of a more sceptical nature whisper that the constant display of what might await those amongst our subjects who do not prove their worth is surely a powerful motivator for our workforce."

 F71_complete_subserviance_title:0 "Complete Subservience"
 F71_complete_subserviance_desc:0 "For far too long our predecessors have been content to skulk along the borders of so-called civilisation. It is long overdue that we have restored the natural order of things and returned gnollkind to their place of preeminence among all the races of Sarhal. Whether the gloriously bloody but usually short-lived empires of the Xhazobines and Xhazobains, or the many proud gnollish realms left in their wake, we have been chosen by the voices below to be the instruments of their will and rule over all others. And finally the many other weaklings inhabiting our lands have started to accept their place in the preordained order as our servants."

 F71_future_of_the_council_title:0 "Future Of The Council"
 F71_future_of_the_council_desc:0 "With great power come great temptations and even greater egos, and tempers have been flaring recently in the chambers of the grand council of Warlocks. Two opposing camps have formed, with the demonologists centered in our traditional stronghold of Mazu Makhara on one hand and the necromantically inclined new guard seated at Muhaqaar on the other. Both claim to possess the necessary vision to lead Rakkaz into an even more gloriously depraved future, but fundamentally disagree on the question of what patrons should guide us there, the voices beyond, who whispered into our ears from the beginning of our journey, or our new tenebrous benefactors from the dread Shadow Swamp. A choice must be made, and soon, before the council collapses into infighting and all we have achieved until now runs like blood through our outstretched hands."

 F71_access_to_the_swamp_title:0 "Access To The Swamp"
 F71_access_to_the_swamp_desc:0 "The voices emanating from the ruins of Mazu Makhara have undoubtedly been instrumental for our rise to our current lofty position, but only an utter fool refuses to use a second weapon if it falls into their hands. To the east of our lands the gloomy expanse of the Shadow Swamp beckons. The necromancers amongst our ranks report a strange attraction pulling them towards the benighted heart of the swamp, calling to them in their darkest dreams. Who knows what sinister revelations they will receive there, now that we have cleared the way into the humid depths of the Shadow Swamp."

 F71_a_perfected_ritual_title:0 "A Perfected Ritual"
 F71_a_perfected_ritual_desc:0 "The secrets hidden deep within the genie ruins of Esuvrem have been invaluable to our warlocks. Unraveling the sorcerous mysteries of the long vanished earth genies has allowed us to perfect the crafting of collars out of enchanted steel for our demoncollar hyenas. Sacrificing traitors and slaves in a fighting pit erected deep within Esuvrem has allowed our patrons to imbue the Dao steel found there with their demonic essence and made the once laborious process of creating demoncollars much simpler and faster."

 F71_demoncollar_demonflare_title:0 "Demoncollar Demonflare"
 F71_demoncollar_demonflare_desc:0 "Thanks to our recent advances in the crafting of demoncollar hyenas we are now able to use fell sorceries to envelop them and their riders in demonic flames before battle and turn them into shock troops even more perfectly suited to bring fear and suffering to our enemies. Let the fools who dare stand against our might writhe in agony at the touch of our hallowed flames."

 F71_willing_vessels_title:0 "Willing Vessels"
 F71_willing_vessels_desc:0 "Cruel, rapacious, ruthless and wicked while at the same time deferential and eager to prove their worth, our gnollish brothers and sisters in the pack have become willing vessels for our desires, always keen to enforce the orders of their warlock masters. And some of the most desperate and skilled champions in our fighting pits have taken this even further, willingly agreeing to be turned into eternally obedient witherlings in return for a restoration of their honor and some measure of mercy for their loved ones."

 F71_whiterlings_rise_title:0 "Witherlings, Arise!"
 F71_whiterlings_rise_desc:0 "Life in Death. Death in Life. The glorious ecstasies of eternal decay are but the latest gift our warlocks have received from our tenebrous patrons. What once toppled the realm left by the Blighted Xhaz has now become the latest and most dreadful weapon in our arsenal. Using the grim sorceries shown to us by the dark denizens of the swamp we have recreated the dreaded Witherlings out of the gloomy mists of our distant history. Now even the most fatally wounded soldier, the most cowardly deserter or the most heinous traitor has the chance to serve a greater purpose again. All they have to do is reach death’s threshold and then our warlocks will do their part to keep them there indefinitely, ready to serve their masters and devour our foes."

 F71_absolute_loyalty_title:0 "Absolute Loyalty"
 F71_absolute_loyalty_desc:0 "Even the most devoted followers may reach a breaking point when confronted with the prospect of excessive suffering and unspeakable depravations in service of their masters, thus limiting their use for some of the more… extreme measures needed to advance our arcane insights and might. But this is not the case for our most perfect creation. Each Witherling is inexorably bound to the will of his warlock master or mistress and utterly dependent on our sorceries to keep their souls bound to their mutilated flesh that is in constant flux between decomposition and regeneration. It was therefore only logical and frankly long overdue to transform our more hesitant warriors into beings of eternal and absolute obedience."

 F71_the_final_order_title:0 "The Final Order"
 F71_the_final_order_desc:0 "The restoration of the ruins of Mazu Makhara, begun back when Rakkaz was just one ambitious pack amongst many and not the empire of despair it is today, has finally been completed. The rocky dome containing the innermost sanctum, shattered eons ago by unknown forces, has been crowned with a wall of obsidian shards embedded in a damestear alloy. The sacrificial pits surrounding the entrance to the subterranean womb of shadows have been equipped with an ingenious drainage system and cleverly hidden cranes enabling the swift removal of all remains between sacrifices and preventing the overflow of the pits. Ceremonial platforms with a central bowl of sheer obsidian have been erected in all cardinal directions to contain the ceremonial pyres. And the voices below appear pleased by our offerings. Our shamans and warlocks ruling over the site report that the whispers they receive have changed in recent months. Instead of constantly spurring us on towards ever greater heights of depravity, we have received what appears to be our final order and have been set loose upon the world, our patrons confident in our unwavering conviction to spread their creed of suffering and our ingenuity in enforcing it."

 F71_profane_army_title:0 "Profane Army"
 F71_profane_army_desc:0 "What sets us apart from other gnollish realms both recent and long gone is our unrestrained embrace of the fell powers our warlocks have gained through their pacts with otherworldly entities. And one of the most crucial of those boons are the sorcerous troops created using forbidden knowledge gleaned from our patrons. Both the demoncollar hyenas and witherlings have proven to be invaluable when it comes to spreading terror amongst the ranks of the enemy and turning their orderly battle lines into a panicked flight."

 F71_mass_sacrifices_title:0 "Mass Sacrifices"
 F71_mass_sacrifices_desc:0 "The pyres are lighting up the night skies all over our realms, the cloud cover appearing as if wreathed in flames. The fighting pits echo with the sounds of desperate struggle and the agonies of the dying. The sacrificial pits are overflowing with the dismembered corpses of captive enemies and slaves. All of Rakkaz is united in worship of the dark lords, the voices from beyond no longer clamoring for more, but silenced by the deluge of sacrifices coming their way, at least for a short while."

 F71_rally_the_kultists_title:0 "Rally the Kultists"
 F71_rally_the_kultists_desc:0 "The fervor amongst our subjects has reached a fever pitch. Devout followers of the Kult, be they gnoll, human, harpy or other, eagerly swarm our army barracks to join our troops. They are chomping at the bit to bring death and suffering to our many enemies and capture ever more sacrifices for our demonic patrons. Who are we to curb their enthusiasm?"

 F71_otherworldly_pacts_title:0 "Otherworldly Pacts"
 F71_otherworldly_pacts_desc:0 "Our warlocks have delved with unbridled enthusiasm into the layers of mystery hiding the arcane truths of the Shadow Swamp from the undeserving. In the process they have grown ever more proficient in negotiating pacts with the otherworldly denizens that inhabit the umbral realm whose influence permeates the gloomy expanse of swamp, draining it of color and life."

 F71_power_of_the_swamp_title:0 "Chosen of Darkness"
 F71_power_of_the_swamp_desc:0 "We have proven to be a worthy tool of our tenebrous overlords, spreading their message of submission to the entities beyond the shroud across the lands. At its core the Shadow Pact is a faith based on fair and equal exchanges. Service rendered in this realm will result in favors granted in the next. And sometimes, when the devotion is pure enough and the tasks carried out of sufficient magnitude, the umbral lords and ladies may exert their influence to grant their devout followers a boon even in this world. And as we have proven time and again, there is no one more devout than us, the chosen of darkness!"

 F71_unrestrained_power_title:0 "Unrestrained Power"
 F71_unrestrained_power_desc:0 "We have never lacked the ambition, nor the fervor or conviction to fulfill our destiny and bring despair and suffering to all who dare stand against us, but until the most recent advances of the arcane metallurgists amongst our warlocks who have taken up residence in Esuvrem, we simply lacked the means for all-out war on all fronts. But now we are not only able to bring the demonic fires of our patrons to the battlefield with our demoncollar hyenas, but can equip even some of our regular troops with a lesser version of the collars, turning them into savage fighters ready to take on any opponent. We are no longer a mere pack, we are now a true horde!"

 F71_beasts_of_hate_title:0 "Beasts of Hate"
 F71_beasts_of_hate_desc:0 "The demoncollar hyenas form the backbone of our armies, leading any charge into enemy ranks, eager to spill their blood and capture new slaves for the pyres. It is therefore only consequent that we build up their ranks and expand their breeding pens, training kennels and accommodations for their riders to take up an influx of new hyenas to bolster our armies."

 F71_rampaging_horde_title:0 "Rampaging Horde"
 F71_rampaging_horde_desc:0 "The drone of our warhorns sounding sends icy tendrils of fear into even the most battle-hardened veterans. The mere rumor of our horde approaching has caused the spontaneous exodus of many a settlement on our borders, their inhabitants preferring an uncertain future in distant lands to the certain destiny of death, enslavement and degradation if they were to encounter our troops. Yet still far too many lands are enjoying a false sense of security, deceiving themselves into believing we cannot possibly reach them. It is long overdue that we correct these misapprehensions. Noone will be safe from the scorching flames of the fire burning within us."

 F71_undying_loyalty_title:0 "Undying Obedience"
 F71_undying_loyalty_desc:0 "Our hordes of Witherlings have grown with each battle fought, with each province subjugated. Their supernatural resilience and undying obedience to their warlock masters ensures that they overcome obstacles even the most battle-frenzied regular warrior would be stumped by. While their presence might cause some degree of unease amongst our regular troops, even the most sceptical among them will admit that the Witherlings are irreplaceable as shock troops."

 F71_send_the_dead_title:0 "Send Forth The Dead"
 F71_send_the_dead_desc:0 "While nothing short of complete disintegration of their physical form can truly destroy a Witherling, they are still made of flesh and bone and can be damaged up to a point where they lose all usefulness. But the soul of the gnoll who was sacrificed to create the Witherling is still anchored to the carcass of its former body, eternally trapped between life and death. Our ingenious necromancers have used this fact to develop a restoration ritual, where those parts of the Witherling that are damaged beyond repair can be replaced by something taken from a fresh corpse or even a living gnoll donor, whether willing or unwilling."

 F71_undead_horde_title:0 "Undead Horde"
 F71_undead_horde_desc:0 "Our Witherlings have proven beyond a doubt that it would be foolish to keep using living warriors in our armies, when the slain dead from both sides of a war can easily be recruited by our necromancers to fight our next war. Like the tides of the sea itself, our horde of undead warriors will sweep aside all resistance. Let the dead remind everyone of what awaits those who resist the will of our umbral masters beyond the shroud."

 F71_bringers_of_suffering_title:0 "Bringers Of Suffering"
 F71_bringers_of_suffering_desc:0 "All over Sarhal countless beings beseech their useless gods to spare them, their loved ones and their homes. But no matter how fervently they pray, nothing and no one can stop the hordes of Rakkaz from fulfilling their ordained task and spread misery, desolation and suffering across all the lands of Sarhal, from the humid jungles along the shores of the Fahvanosy Sea, to the towering mountains of the Serpentspine, from the desolate beaches where the sand sea of the Salahad meets the waves of the Lament to the thriving ports along the Ringlet Sea."

 F71_throne_breaker_title:0 "Throne Breaker"
 F71_throne_breaker_desc:0 "Zerat, the last remnant of the 332nd lizardfolk empire of Anzara, has fallen into our hands. Its massive Zatsarya spire has been decorated with arcane runes by our warlocks and shamans, its many inhabitants have been enslaved and the shores of lake Lasadza are awash with the offal of sacrifices. No longer shall Zerat be a rallying point for the imperialistic ambitions of the lizardfolk. Instead it will become the malign heart of our power in these southern jungles, pumping the putrid black blood of anguish through the veins of these ancient lands, so that they may fall entirely into our hands."

 F71_power_of_the_curse_title:0 "Power Of The Curse"
 F71_power_of_the_curse_desc:0 "The Asshana lizardfolk have been blessed by the dark mistresses of the Shadow Swamp with ferocious strength and an eagerness to devour their enemy that would be befitting for any gnoll. But in their feeblemindedness they have for the longest time confused this gift with a curse and attempted to distract themselves with artistic endeavours. Only now, under our malevolent guidance, have they accepted their true nature and unleashed their inner demon, swiftly becoming an important addition to our armies."

 F71_end_of_denial_title:0 "End Of Denial"
 F71_end_of_denial_desc:0 "If there is one thing the lizardfolk are known for, it is the tenacity of their convictions. But even the most cherished of delusions eventually shatter under the weight of an uncaring reality. And so it happened with the belief in the coming of their prophesied 333rd empire. With all of their lands now firmly within our grasp, many amongst their number have abandoned their erroneous convictions and embraced their new role as our subjects, eager to prove their worth to their new gnollish masters. And as for those amongst their number who stubbornly cling to their delusions, the fighting pits always need fresh meat."

 F71_the_slayers_fate_title:0 "The Slayer's Fate"
 F71_the_slayers_fate_desc:0 "Ever since our coup the council of warlocks has become the true master of Rakkaz. No matter what successor of Rakkaz warmed their behind on the corpse throne of the Slayer, they all were merely our puppets and mouthpieces for the orders coming from the council. However many members of the council openly question whether there is a continued need for this last vestige of the old order and whether we should dispense with the formalities and openly declare the leader of the council the first warlock king."

 F71_domain_of_suffering_title:0 "Domain of Suffering"
 F71_domain_of_suffering_desc:0 "Never let an amateur do a professional’s job. This is the lesson we have taught the many denizens of the shadow plane who have taken up residence in the Shadow Swamp. After centuries of ineffectual attempts at expansion by the shadow trolls we have now become the true champions of our umbral masters and created a vast domain of suffering and despair that extends far beyond the borders of the swamp and exceeds their wildest expectations. The shadow trolls on the other hand have proven to be useful only in one regard - their extraordinary ability to regenerate makes them ideal candidates for our fighting pits, where they last far beyond all others and have become a perpetual source of exquisite agonies for our masters."

 F71_dark_messengers_title:0 "Dark Messengers"
 F71_dark_messengers_desc:0 "With our latest efforts in fortifying our hold on the Shadow Swamp we have proven beyond a doubt that we are worthy instruments of the desires of our masters, chosen to spread their message and further their ominous designs for our world. The highest ranks of our warlock order are confident that we now have amassed sufficient power and arcane knowledge and proven our worth to their satisfaction so that we may be allowed a direct audience with our esteemed patrons."

 F71_seed_of_darkness_title:0 "Seed Of Darkness"
 F71_seed_of_darkness_desc:0 "The humans inhabiting the lands to the east of our savannah homeland have long professed to be avowed enemies of the umbral creatures emanating from the Shadow Swamp. But this has not hindered those amongst their number living closest to the swamp from making furtive pacts and sordid agreements with the tenebrous mistresses of the swamp whenever it suited them. The seeds of darkness have thus long since taken hold amongst them, and we only had to nourish these seeds with the appropriate amount of suffering to see them blossom into the dark flower of our faith."

 F71_the_profane_empire_title:0 "The Profane Empire"
 F71_the_profane_empire_desc:0 "Noone, whether alive or dead, can dispute that we have crafted ourselves a destiny as undisputed rulers of all gnollkind by not letting quaint concepts such as mercy or compassion stand in the way of our ambition. Only absolute submission to the depraved whims of our dark patrons from the realms beyond has cleared the path to absolute power in this realm. Ours is a profane empire, built on the suffering of untold and unnamed masses, and we will continue on this path until all of Sarhal suffers under our yoke. And once this has been accomplished, the whole world stands open to us, just begging to be devoured!"

 flavour_rakkaz.0.t:0 "Staying True To Our Name"
 flavour_rakkaz.0.d:0 "Ever since our pack was founded by Rakkaz, Slayer-of-Slayers, we have prided ourselves on our martial prowess and our fiercely independent streak. When our founder perished defending her ally Grizaka against the incursions of Viakkoc and his corsairs at the battle of Kheterat, her daughter Rakkaz II was ready to step up and take the throne. But unlike her mother, she was not blinded by misplaced loyalties, and when Grizaka succumbed to her delusions of grandeur and declared herself ‘Empress of all Gnollkind’, demanding our submission and inclusion into her would-be empire, we were ready to send the head of her emissary back to the would-be empress and seek our fortunes in the vast savannah between the Mother’s Sorrow and the Shadow Swamp. Now that we have established ourselves in our new lands, we are ready to take the fight to our former allies and slay Grizaka before she has the opportunity to come for us."

 flavour_rakkaz.1.d:0 "A hyena rider has appeared on the dusty horizon and quickly approaches the gates of Zirrbit. When brought before the throne of Irkorzik, the rider is revealed to be an emissary of Rakkaz, a fellow pack mistress from the eastern savannah. The emissary spins an elaborate tale about the dangers Grizaka’s madness poses for both our packs if left unchecked, and offers an opportunity to jointly take the so-called ‘Empress of all Gnollkind’ on, before she grows too strong to safely subdue, promising our pack free rein to plunder the rich lands along the upper Mother’s Sorrow currently under Grizaka’s control. It is now for us to decide whether that offer is genuine and if we should accept it."
 flavour_rakkaz.1.a:0 "The riches of Irsmahap will be ours!"
 flavour_rakkaz.1.b:0 "They can deal with that themselves."

 #Strange Happenings In The Pack
 flavour_rakkaz.2.t:0 "Strange Happenings In The Pack"
 flavour_rakkaz.2.d:0 "Recently, something strange seems to have affected the general mood within the pack. Festivities seem to be more exuberant than usual, and more than once after a particularly raucous celebration a slave has been found dead, with signs of abuse all over their body. Even those amongst the pack who used to show little interest in the rituals of our shamans have joined in with feverish zeal whenever a new sacrificial pyre is lit. And many amongst our ranks whisper of disturbed sleep and equally disturbing dreams, and strange murmurs perceived at the edge of hearing during the night. Our warlocks profess to be stumped regarding the possible cause of all this."
 flavour_rakkaz.2.a:0 "Must have been a ritual gone wrong."

 #Drastic Increase In Sacrifices
 flavour_rakkaz.3.t:0 "Drastic Increase In Sacrifices"
 flavour_rakkaz.3.d:0 "The crackling of the fire and the cackling cheers of the revelers echo through the night, the hot winds coming from the northern desert carry with them the smell of burning flesh and soot. Where a couple of years ago the sacrificial pyres were lit maybe once a month, it has become a weekly celebration in most parts of our land, and in some of our major settlements it has become an almost daily occurrence. What exactly has caused this sudden rise in pious fervor remains unclear however, with participants of the rituals seeming confused afterwards about the reason for their presence. Yet our warlock advisors cannot detect any kind of magical tampering with their mind."
 flavour_rakkaz.3.a:0 "This isn't necessarily a bad thing, right?"

 #Spread Of Disobedience
 flavour_rakkaz.4.t:0 "Spread Of Disobedience"
 flavour_rakkaz.4.d:0 "An alarming trend has developed in the pack as of late. The traditional hierarchies, foundational for the functioning of a pack as large as ours, are increasingly challenged, with inferiors ignoring or openly challenging the orders of their superiors. What started as isolated incidents quickly resolved and ascribed to the inflated ambitions of some underlings, has spread like wildfire through the pack, and is approaching a level where the continued running of our pack might be made impossible. We may be forced to take drastic measures to restore discipline if this trend continues."
 flavour_rakkaz.4.a:0 "This is starting to get worrying..."

 #The Silent Coup
 flavour_rakkaz.5.t:0 "The Silent Coup"
 flavour_rakkaz.5.d:0 "Our painstakingly planned takeover has been an unreserved success. The foolish descendants of Rakkaz I didn’t know what was happening to them even as we undermined all the pillars they based their rule on. Bringing the shamans on our side with the promise of constant sacrifices, paralyzing the military chain of command and making the minds of the simple pack members increasingly susceptible to our influence has been hard work. But thanks to our efforts, our coup has processed as smoothly as an obsidian blade carving out the heart of a sacrifice.\n\nWhile we may keep up appearances, at least for a while, and let [Root.Monarch.GetName] remain sitting on the corpse throne of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] ancestors, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] will dance on [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] strings to our tune like any other good puppet. Now that we have taken over, it is time to begin our arcane research in earnest, without being held back by superstitious fools and cowards. Our dark patrons expect great things from us, and we will not disappoint them!"
 flavour_rakkaz.5.a:0 "Now, we have control over this pack and will not relinquish our new power!"

 flavour_rakkaz.8.d:0 "Kheterata has been broken. The Mother’s Sorrow has turned red with blood. The temples of the Khet are charred ruins, their pleasure barges fuel for the sacrificial pyres. Kheterata’s people are led away in chains to serve their rightful masters or feed the hunger of our dark patrons. At long last we have avenged the humiliation suffered by our kind after the defeat of Rakhor at the hands of accursed Elikhet and his vile spawn. Those amongst our ranks who have descended the furthest in service to the voices below swear that they could hear Rakhors distorted cackle emanating from the Womb of Shadows as our forces began adorning Elikhets pyramid with demonic sigils."

 #An Impasse In The Council

 flavour_rakkaz.9.d:0 "Tempers are flaring in the hallowed halls of the warlock council over the matter of its future course and more than once warlocks of opposing camps have almost come to blows, spurred on by the mutual antipathy of their respective patrons, leaving a dispute with singed-off fur or a preternaturally aged limb. This state of affairs cannot continue, a binding decision has to be made regarding the future path of our warlocks and by extension the whole pack and our fell empire. The question that requires a definitive answer can be boiled down to the following: Which faction of warlocks has the superior patrons and can be entrusted to lead us towards a gloriously depraved future?"

We are now in the position to follow the example of our distant forebear Rakhor, the first of our kind to possess the courage to traffic with the voices emanating from Mazu Makhara. He raided all the lands of ancient Ketherata and drenched their lands in the blood of their people, only to be stopped at the gates of Kheterat itself by the accursed Elikhet. Having become the undisputed rulers of the Gol savannah and masters of the upper Mother’s Sorrow, who is to stop us from charging down the river in a deluge of chaos and devastation."

 #A Walking Abomination
 flavour_rakkaz.11.t:0 "A Walking Abomination"
 flavour_rakkaz.11.d:0 "The smell of rotting flesh assaulting the nostrils of the necromancers is the first thing they perceive in the gloomy shade of the dungeon cell as they inspect the latest iteration of their grand experiment. The limp body of a once formidable gnoll warrior that deserted after being nearly mauled to death by a demoncollar hyena is strapped to a wall, pus suppurating from his wounds and one of his arms only attached by a few ligaments.\n\nWhile he remains initially unresponsive to his surroundings as he is dragged from his cell, suddenly he starts to weakly struggle against the bindings as he is strapped to the altar. But all his efforts are in vain and he is swiftly secured in place. Vile liquids brewed from swamp water and much worse ingredients are forced down his throat, and his flesh is carved with necromantic sigils. Finally a spike of corroded black iron is hammered into his shoulder joint and nearly severed arm, reconnecting the two, and as the chants praising the umbral mistresses of oblivion reach a fever pitch, Brukhazz, the head necromancer, drives an obsidian blade etched with arcane symbols deep into the warrior's heart.\n\nIt is perfectly silent as the necromancers wait to see if this time their efforts have not been futile. And finally, after agonizing moments that feel like an eternity, the body of the warrior starts to twitch and shake, slowly rising from the altar slab and opening up milky white eyes as corrupted black blood is oozing out of his many wounds, slowly sealing them. The creature's head swivels haltingly until its blind eyes focus on the head necromancer, a low sound somewhere between a wheeze and a growl emanating from its chest. With a simple gesture the necromancer issues his command and the Witherling staggers to his feet."
 flavour_rakkaz.11.a:0 "A truly abhorrent result, and yet so perfect."

 #Increase In Desertions
 flavour_rakkaz.12.t:0 "Increase In Desertions"
 flavour_rakkaz.12.d:0 "Our demoncollar hyenas have proven their value on the battlefield ever since their inception, spreading panic amongst the ranks of the enemy wherever they go. One minor detail that has caused some amount of consternation amongst the rank and file of our armies is however their tendency to become overly… enthusiastic when in the midst of their killing frenzy and targeting not only the enemy but our own troops as well. For some reason some of our warriors seem to take issue with that and desert our ranks before a battle instead of fulfilling their duties."
 flavour_rakkaz.12.a:0 "Damn those cowards!"

 #The Future Of The Slayers
 flavour_rakkaz.14.t:0 "The Future Of The Slayers"
 flavour_rakkaz.14.d:0 "Rakkaz Slayer-of-Slayers and her descendants have been invaluable in our journey to turn their pack into an obedient tool to enforce the desires of our patrons on an unsuspecting world. Their conceited inability to consider that instead of us warlocks being used to further their goals it might be the other way around, coupled with simple minds that are easily swayed in the direction we want as well as their callous disregard for the fate of those who would dare oppose our rise in prominence made them ideal puppets. But any tool can be discarded once it has served its purpose.\n\nOur hold over the pack is by now unassailable and many amongst our ranks believe it is time to cut the strings, discard the puppet and place one of our own on the corpse throne of the Slayers. Others are content with the way things work and see no reason for unnecessarily disturbing a perfectly adequate system of rule from the shadows, secure from any potential backlash of their actions by the meat shield on the throne."

 flavour_rakkaz.15.d:0 "The flicker of abyssal flames glimmering within [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] eyes and deep down [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] gullet, a shadow that moves independent of its source, constant murmurations at the edge of hearing sounding wherever [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] goes. Ever since [Root.Monarch.GetName] has chosen to share his flesh and soul with a denizen of the nether realms [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] a decade ago has become a fearsome presence. Mortal flesh however cannot contain the essence of even a lesser demon indefinitely, and lately the cracks have begun to show. [Root.Monarch.GetName] has been increasingly wrecked by surges of agony and weakness, and not even [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] favorite pastimes such as feasting on the flesh of kerho infants in front of their parents have been able to soothe  [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] erratic mood swings. It all culminated earlier today in a bout of agony of unprecedented strength, causing [Root.Monarch.GetName] to claw at [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] flesh and tearing out whole chunks of it, with boiling blood gushing out of the wound. The contortions of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] body increased until it started to bloat and glow with an inner infernal light, only to explode in a mass of gore and charred meat."

With each agonizing death the bindings keeping this arboreal abomination contained have been weakened. The predictions by our warlocks that the tree has grown over a wound between worlds and strengthening it will weaken the barrier between the planes have been proven right. It has now become a gateway between planes of existence, allowing our most intrepid warlocks to establish a foothold on the other side of death. And on the other side of the veil separating life and death, the innumerable realms that form the domains of our otherworldly masters are easily accessible through cracks in the foundation of the shadow plane, formed by the constant struggle between the encroaching infernal planes of our patrons and the eldritch denizens of the shadow plane. With the right amount of raw arcane might and the twisted sorcerous ingenuity our warlocks are rightly notorious for, we may be able to open a permanent path between our world and the infernal planes."

The greedy roots of the Yezelne Nisha gather sustenance from both sides of the veil, turning this sinister world tree into a gateway between our world and that of our tenebrous overlords and -ladies. By strengthening the Shadowroot Matriarch we have achieved what all other servants of our hag mistresses have failed to accomplish. The door between life and death stands wide open, and the lifeforce of our plane of existence is draining into the unfathomable void beyond, a fatal wound into life itself. With each day our reality and the ceaseless expanse of oblivion align more and more. And we shall be amply rewarded by the night hags for our devout service in the new world that is about to be stillborn from the blending of both sides of the veil."

 estate_mages_warlock_pact_power_desc:0 "Channeling the eldritch powers of their demonic patrons enables the warlocks to bring devastating sorceries to the battlefield. However, nothing comes without a price and a sacrifice is necessary to gain the favor of the voices below."
 estate_mages_warlock_pact_overcharge_desc:0 "Using now freely available damestear as a focus, our warlocks are now able to use their necromantic skills to siphon of a fraction of the lifeforce of entire provinces and redirect it to energize the inhabitants of the surroundings of the warlock’s gathering places, making it far easier to develop those surroundings."
