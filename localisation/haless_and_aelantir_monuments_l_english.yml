moon_mountains_desc: "The Mountains of the Moon are the highest point in Bulwar outside of the Serpentspine. During the days before the New Sun Cult when the old Bulwari gods were worshipped, the Mountains of the Moon were a location venerated for its holiness by both the Bulwari and the Cannorian followers of the Dame, with the most devout individuals attempting to reach the mountain's summit as a pilgrimage. Today with the rise of the New Sun Cult and the worship of Jaher as Surael reborn, the Mountains of the Moon are nearly universally derided by the Elven priests of the New Sun Cult as being heretical in nature, and forbid ascending it."

stone_palace_desc: "An ancient fortress, the Stone Palace of Ekluzagnu served the Tluukt gnollish armies as their first line of defense against attacks by Bulwari humans, though it would ironically eventually become their last line. In 1507 Tluukt's old enemies, the Jaddari, declared the final war against the gnolls in Bulwar. While some traitorous gnolls sided with the elves and accepted the Jadd, the loyal gnolls of Tluukt fought to the last soldier, but despite their ferocity were pushed back all the way into the recently restored Ekluzagnu. Here, the Jaddari led an extremely long and costly siege, fighting floor by floor to kill every single gnoll in the fortress. Ironically, the very same place destroyed by Xhazobine ended up being the site of last stand of gnollish rule in Bulwar."

eranils_oddities_desc: "In 1450 AA, the census of Queen Qamara szel-Azanerdu identified more than 200 stalls and shops that plied their trade in the markets of Kalib. But only one is featured in Bulwari folk-tales, only one has its own song, only one can never be found in the same place twice: Eranil's Oddities.\n\nThe store dates back to the Phoenix Empire, and has been run by the eccentric elven craftsman Eranil the Strange for all those centuries. From djinni teeth to vials of Jaher's blood to peculiar variants of Damestear, the goods it sells are unique in all Halann.\n\nIts clientele included merchants and adventurers, pilgrims and scholars, and by the 17th century, even witch-kings' envoys and Ravelian artificers would on occasion seek it out. And for all: if they fail to find what they are looking for at Eranil's shop, well, there are plenty of other merchants quick to hawk their wares."

 sarisung_city_desc:0 "--------------\nSitting at the intersection of The Kharunyana and Telkhram, the markets of Sarisung have long been a hub of commerce and exotic goods. From North and South, East and West, the riverbarges sail to Sarisung, docking in its many canals and holding the world's largest continuous open-air market. Ever shifting, this maze of merchants and hawkers are the blood that circulate in the Heart of Haless, mixing and reinvigorating here before sailing to all the corners of the world, leaving the great city enriched with each visit."
