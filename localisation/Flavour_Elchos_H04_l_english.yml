 elchos_legacy_of_goldtree_rebellion_desc:0 "With the heroic leadership of the young Manaron Goldtree, Elchos broke free from the repressive regime of Arakeprun in 1435. Gathering support from the frustrated nobles of the realm and from Pelomar, Manaron fought the clergy of Arakeprun to break free of theocratic control and assert leadership of the nobility. It has been four years since this war, and with every passing year Arakeprun has recovered its strength, lead by the powerful mage Filnar Dawnfire after their humiliating defeat. Elchos must be ready to defend its sovereignty if we are to hold off the clergy."
