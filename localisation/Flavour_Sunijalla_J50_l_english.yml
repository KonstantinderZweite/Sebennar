This is nonsense, we do not rule as if we are better than everybody else, just as a president represents the will of the public by grace of the governed, so too does a king represent the divinity of all.

Several minor noble families in each nation are now being considered as the rightful monarchs of their respective nations, and we intend to establish them as the new royal family of the nation, and naturally royal marry them so they can gain deep leverage into the state itself.

Should we accept them fully into the loving embrace of Kalyin, making them equal members and allowing them to step hoof into the lakes? Or should we simply forgive the past, and allow them to roam the plains, so long as they do not attack our new settlements?\n\n§YOur decision will affect the autonomy of future centaur conquests§!"

We travelled for naught 20 minutes until we stumbled upon tall humanoid creatures, a few feet taller than us with tones similar to our own, if not slightly darker. Our hosts were surprisingly gracious, offering us their food, while taking none for themselves. We learned of their culture and their people, who had broken free from their "great hunger". We told them of our intentions of research and study, and our conversation with the Ogre leaders were a success, and upon explaining our intentions, they offered to house and shelter us for the time being. We stayed with them for 2 weeks, where we learned and studied their culture, language, and magic.""

We took a weary stance at first, aiming our guns carefully, however it seems as if utilizing some spell, all of our weapons refused to fire, with men stating that they "felt great aversion to violence." This came as a shock to us all, with many in my group turning to thoughts of despair, thinking back on the old ban of magic in the Lakes  and the horrors of the Tyrant Queen. Realizing that in the end we could never hope to win against such power, I decided to try talking to one of them, although their tongue was foreign and strange, one noble trained in Yanshen and who was on a Treasure fleet mission before recognized the language as belonging to the Hobgoblins, a race of warriors west of Yanshen. They introduced themselves as Hobgoblins, but specified they were Eagle Hobgoblins, distinct from their cousins. We were surprised they were smaller than expected, but we did not share this. Learning from the Ogres, we carefully approached, setting our weapons down and thanks to another noble who made diligent effort to learn from our previous encounter, we were able to be in their good graces, as they invited us to speak and rest.""

Upon journeying, we discovered relics and artifacts of a people long since gone, far more ancient than anything back home. Images of humanoid figures with long ears, ancient and powerful machinery long since broken apart, and murals of battles, wars, people we do not know of. They say there are many more places like this, however we are lucky to have encountered them, as others of both their kind and of the Soulseeker Ogres are not so fond of outsiders.

A great many people have petitioned the royal court to not only send more expeditions, but volunteer to join these missions themselves, seeking to make a name for themselves in this great land. While our past aversion to magic was rooted in great fear and suspicion, perhaps this can be a new dawn for our people?
