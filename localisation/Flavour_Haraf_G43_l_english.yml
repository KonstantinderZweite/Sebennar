 integrate_datai_tsel_decision_desc:0 "The riders of House Datai’tsel have a rebellious history, often complaining about complacency and laziness in the Federation’s rulership. We will show them that we’re able to look beyond our borders and that [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] is as capable of military command as their proud chiefs by leading the upcoming raid on their Mayte rivals."

 integrate_hoila_kosu_decision_desc:0 "House Hoila’kosu is often seen as strange by most Haraf'ne due to its elective nature. However, we might be able to use this fact to our advantage. By ensuring our lands are prosperous and well administered,  [Root.Monarch.GetName] could have good odds of being elected."

 #Events 
 haraf_events.1.t:0 "Da'kino's Decree"
 haraf_events.1.d:0 "It is a cool and dry dawn that greets Da'kino as he exits his home. Four Haraf'ne men wait eagerly for his presence at the roaring bonfire in the center of Nani Kinn - the flaming heart that burns for every meeting of the five great House chiefs.\n\n“My Chief Alas'gasidi,” barks the Datai'tsel chief in an awkward salute. “We have all journeyed many days for this meeting. My people require me to lead the upcoming raid, so let us-”\n\n“Yes - let us speak on why I have summoned you all here,” Da'kino interrupts. “Rather, allow me to speak, lest you forget who speaks for the Houses.” A brief, uneasy silence fills the air. It is permeated only by the ever-present crackling and heat of the bonfire, and scent of woodsmoke.\n\n“For all my life, I have been troubled by the feuds of our Houses; by the wars of our fathers and our fathers' fathers. I have tried to mend our differences - to live as we did in the days of Tselayos. I realize now that it is impossible for those bonds to be repaired if the Alas'gasidi remain as first among equals,” Da'kino laments. “The inane cycle of the Houses' wars and upheavals perpetuated by the decadent and shortsighted Haraf'ne of ages past must perish. In its place will rise an eternal, prosperous land - and I will lead you all to it.” \nThere is a momentary pause. “I have summoned you all to declare that the antiquated rule of the old Haraf'ne ends now,” booms Da'kino. “In my name and of all the gods' and Paragons', I, and the Alas'gasidi, will be considered foremost among the Houses. Not only guardians and mediators of the Houses, but governors and rulers, as well,” A fervor matching that of the bonfire's flaming heart and the dawn's rising sun swells now in Da'kino's words. “Who will declare themselves to be in disaccord and known as traitors to the Haraf'ne? As thieves of a tranquil life to your future kin? As nothing but a single, sour note in the songs of the Singers? Speak now.”\n\nThe four chiefs all stand but do not speak. All except the Keiin'achi chief, who offers only a dire remark before departing: “If you wish to rule the Flame-Born, you must prove you have the strength to take it!”\nAnd so the first oaths of allegiance are sworn. Either believing in Da'kino's vision, fearing the repercussions of refusal, or elements of both - the chiefs of Houses Alas'gasidi, Datai'tsel, Leeti'haàt, and Hoila'kosu all join in binding accord; to realize Da'kino's nascent ambition."
 haraf_events.1.a:0 "Let the integration of the Houses begin!"
 haraf_events.2.t:0 "Taming the Sandworm"
 haraf_events.2.d:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] and his entourage arrive in Leeti'haàt lands, marked by dunes of sand slowly replacing the dry grasslands they are accustomed to. After the expected reception by the Leeti'haàt chief, [Root.Monarch.GetName] is led on a tour of the desert settlement and eventually intrigued by the tamed collection of giant, burrowing worms native to the Haraf desert.\n\n“Ah, I see you have a curious eye for the sandworms,” says the Leeti'haàt chief. “I must admit, even after all these years living among them, I still find them as majestic as when I was a boy. Magnificent gifts of Ek'elas, they are.” A reminiscent smile decorates the chief's face as [Root.Monarch.GetName] shifts his attention from the sandworms to the chief. “I wish to ride one of them,” states [Root.Monarch.GetName], plainly. The smile on the chief's face suddenly spreads into an ecstatic look of glee as he hears the words. “I thought you'd never ask, my Chief Alas'gasidi!”\n\nSeveral minutes pass as [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s chosen sandworm is readied and he stands atop it. “My Chief Alas'gasidi, I must insist you ride one of the smaller sandworms for your first attempt! This one is much too large and ornery for a beginner!” “No need to worry, my Chief Leeti'haàt! If I can wrangle the Haraf'ne, I can handle a measly worm!” boasts [Root.Monarch.GetName]. As if in protest, the sandworm charges ahead as the chief struggles to resist the worm's attempts to throw him off. At last, [Root.Monarch.GetName] sinks his wormhooks into the beast and is able to steer it back towards the settlement.\n\nA cheering crowd awaits the Chief Alas'gasidi as he returns and the Chief Leeti'haàt receives him. “Amazing! Such a large worm broken in so quickly, it would be a shame to not offer him to the one who has bested him! All that he requires now is a name. My Chief Alas'gasidi?”"
 haraf_events.2.a:0 "I will name you Pai'ner."
 haraf_events.2.b:0 "You look like a Ch'oosh'ne !"
 haraf_events.2.c:0 "How about Wili'marah ?"
 haraf_events.3.t:0 "The Raid"
 haraf_events.3.d:0 "An ancient Datai'tsel tradition awarded only to the leader of a raid; a flowing, gold sash is fastened around the waist of the Chief Alas'gasidi by a lithe servant in his tent. This war camp is bustling with the anxious pacing of camp followers as the hundreds of Nean'áuvulin commit their final preparations.\n\n“My Chief Alas'gasidi,” calls the Datai'tsel Chief as he enters the tent. “The raid is upon us. As discussed, my token force and I will draw the masked ones' fighting men out into the nearby flats while you and the Nean'áuvulin position yourselves to overwhelm them from the rear and flank. Afterwards, we'll be free to take whatever we please.” The Datai'tsel Chief smirks as he finishes speaking; he finds a certain satisfaction in a well-executed plan, however bloody.\n\nThe raid itself develops as planned and the Mayte village is soon set upon and subjected to the usual horrors a civilian population is bound to experience after being occupied by a foreign army. Kalun masks torn from dead warriors, local produce taken, and anything else of value pillaged. The Chief Alas'gasidi dismounts at a yet untouched dwelling and enters, stopping just inside, the torchlight reflecting off the chief's brilliant sash. A Mayte woman stands in front of her sobbing child, holding a defiant pose, a knife pointed at the Chief Alas'gasidi. The chief and woman stand, staring at the other. Although the woman wears a mask, her piercing eyes betray her fear and anger. “You killed them; how dare you?” The chief hears what her wide, tearful eyes seem to project and realizes raids like this are yet another symptom of the cycle of the old, decadent Haraf'ne. [Root.Monarch.GetName] has little time to spare as his raiders draw ever closer. He throws his golden sash to the woman's feet and gestures towards his horse. In stilted Mayte, [Root.Monarch.GetName] speaks “Take... and ride. Live.”\n\nBack at the Haraf'ne war camp, the Chiefs Datai'tsel and Alas'gasidi discuss the divvying of loot. “Forgive what may be my insolence, but losing the golden sash and your mount? What could have possibly happened to them?” asks the Chief Datai'tsel. “Lost in the chaos of battle, unfortunately.” replies the Chief Alas'gasidi. The Chief Datai'tsel continues speaking as the Chief Alas'gasidi feels a sense of relief. They must have escaped."
 haraf_events.3.a:0 "One day, the Mayte will prosper, just as we shall. I swear it."
 haraf_events.4.t:0 "A Strange Custom Exploited"
 haraf_events.4.d:0 "“This cannot be, it simply cannot,” utters the Chief Hoila'kosu softly. “The Chief Alas'gasidi will make a mockery of our sacred elections if he is allowed candidacy.” The Chief Hoila’kosu turns to her assembled elector-council. “We may not have the power to defy his entrance, but we, all of us, must agree: not a one shall cast their lot in for [Root.Monarch.GetName].”\n\nThe magnificent festival and market that accompanies every Hoila'kosu election day is one of the grandest in living memory. Tens of thousands of traders, farmers, and villagers from Hoila'kosu lands and even all Haraf gather here to make merry, trade, and witness the spectacle of the election, of the Day of Bounty’s Choosing. Chief [Root.Monarch.GetName] makes his parade to the bustling city-for-a-day under the escort of a hundred Nean'áuvulin with the Chiefs Datai'tsel and Leeti'haàt in tow. Finally, they arrive at the forum where every elector, and therefore candidate, has the privilege of standing atop its speakers' platform. [Root.Monarch.GetName] takes his place among the electors and the Chief Hoila'kosu.\n\nThe Chief Alas'gasidi turns to address the huge, clamoring crowd. A chief of a separate House in the running for the chiefdom of House Hoila'kosu is unprecedented - yet not expressly forbidden.\n\n“My dear people,” shouts [Root.Monarch.GetName] in a speechlike cadence. “I sincerely hope that you all enjoy the magnificent festivities hosted by our gracious Hoila'kosu. I would also like to announce that in my benevolence and goodwill, I have brought food and drink aplenty, enough from the bounteous lands of Alas'gasidi to extend the festivities here for three more days and nights.” The crowd roars in jovial hollering as the words leave [Root.Monarch.GetName]. “[Root.Monarch.GetName]! [Root.Monarch.GetName]! A chiefdom for the bounty of [Root.Monarch.GetName] Alas'gasidi!” chants several men in the crowd. Soon, all in the crowd mimic their chant and the final vote is called to quell the rising tensions.\n\nThe Chief Hoila'kosu and her electors scan the forum: an expectant mob calling for an Alas'gasidi, the guard of every other House outnumbering the Hoila'kosu many times over - she contemplates postponing the vote until [Root.Monarch.GetName] leans to her and whispers. “Your electors are already aware of what will happen if this vote ends unfavorably. Let us preserve the peace of this illustrious gathering.” The Chief Hoila'kosu offers only a solemn expression as she and the electors voice their votes.\n\n“It is unanimous! [Root.Monarch.GetName] Alas’gasidi is our new chief!”"
 haraf_events.4.a:0 "There was only one real choice."
 haraf_events.5.t:0 "A Duel of Fates"
 haraf_events.5.d:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] grips the talisman around his neck tightly as he and his retinue approach the designated spot; an arena in which the chiefs of Alas'gasidi and Keiin'achi will participate in an ancient Keiin'achi tradition: a fatal duel whose winner takes rule of the other's demesne. [Root.Monarch.GetName] dismounts his horse and enters the arena; a large, simple dirt circle, its perimeter skirted with low-lying flames where the Chief Keiin'achi awaits.\n\nThe Chief Keiin'achi holds a steady glare. “So, the Alas'gasidi has finally come? The great unifier? I suppose I must admit a modicum of respect for you, unlike the other 'great houses' - soft and undeserving of their station, who at the whim of their lord pledge undying loyalty.” The Chief Keiin'achi's expression and tone then quickly becomes dark. “None of that matters now. When nothing remains of you but ashes, the houses will understand that what is truly important - the power to enforce your will, to dominate, and they will all fall before the Keiin'achi.”\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] barely has time to unsheathe his knife before a firebolt glances past his body. “Is that it? A knife?” The Chief Keiin'achi laughs. “I command the fires of this world and you deign to kill me with a sharp bit of metal? Let's finish this, then.” As the Chief Keiin'achi finishes speaking, he lets loose a giant stream of flame; a cone of utter destruction, engulfing [Root.Monarch.GetName]. Then, slicing through the flames, a blade's edge sinks deep into the chest of the Keiin'achi. The flame dissipates to reveal an unscathed [Root.Monarch.GetName].\n\n“Y-you-,” the Keiin'achi struggles to speak amidst the pooling blood in his lungs. “Ha-how?” [Root.Monarch.GetName] dangles the talisman around his neck. “A special sort of necklace,” states [Root.Monarch.GetName]. “It was fashioned by one of your penitents. The Diyof'dianil. Enchanted with some sort of abjuration, he tells me.” [Root.Monarch.GetName] pulls the knife from the dying Keiin'achi's chest. “He will take your place now. In service to the greater Kinah, of course.” The felled mage's breathing stops as [Root.Monarch.GetName] returns to his mount. 'Great unifier', thinks [Root.Monarch.GetName]. With the fealty of the Keiin'achi, it is no longer just a dream, but now within reach!\n\nThe unity of all Haraf'ne."
 haraf_events.5.a:0 "So uncivilized."
 haraf_events.6.t:0 "Integrating the Houses"
 haraf_events.6.d:0 "With the integration of every great house under the Alas'gasidi, the dream of a united people has finally come to pass. Although there are still the myriad concerns of the houses to contend with in this new, centralized federation, [Root.Monarch.GetName] finally feels a sense of relief in the fulfillment of Da'kino's Decree. It is up to [Root.Monarch.GetName] and all Haraf'ne to decide the course of Haraf now."
 haraf_events.6.a:0 "Perhaps we may finally gaze beyond our old horizons."
 haraf_events.8.t:0 "The Roaming Assembly Takes Power"
 haraf_events.8.d:0 "Now with the adoption of new institutions the Roaming Assembly of the Kinah Federation has gained the opportunity to truly centralise and reform the Harafe. Many among the Houses support this reform, yet several prominent members of the houses subjugated under Alas’Gasidi are actively speaking against our effort, claiming it to be an affront to the House system."
 haraf_events.8.a:0 "They cannot stand against the future."
 haraf_events.9.t:0 "A Ruined Bounty"
 haraf_events.9.d:0 "Despite our legitimate rule over the Houses of Hoila’Kosu and Keiin’Achi several of their leaders have risen against our reformation and centralisation effort, hoping to drag the Kinah back into the cycle of chaos that has eternally plagued these lands. They have struck at the new farms and our other attempts at industrialising, hoping to destroy the future of our nation."
 haraf_events.9.a:0 "We will not allow such acts."
 haraf_events.10.t:0 "Support from Desert and Jungle"
 haraf_events.10.d:0 "The Houses of Hoila’Kosu and Leet’Haát are more open to change than their peers, they have approached us with support and to aid in our reform effort. Likely the former out of apology for their kin’s revolt and the latter in hopes of favourable trade deals, but their help is still appreciated."
 haraf_events.10.a:0 "Finally some good news."
 haraf_events.11.t:0 "The Fear of Fire"
 haraf_events.11.d:0 "The mercy extended to the Keiin’achi after their revolt against the Kinah Federation in 1403 appears to have been a mistake. Once more their pyromancers and warriors march into the lands of other houses burning and stealing, no doubt claiming the centralisation of the federation as justification for their insolent intrusion."
 haraf_events.11.a:0 "We doused their flame once, we shall do so again."
 haraf_events.12.t:0 "The Kinah's End, but the Harafics' Beginning"
 haraf_events.12.d:0 "Decadence aplenty has battered the Harafe people for centuries; the houses struggling against one another in a toxic battle over wealth and power even when united under the Kinah. Now the Kinah is no more and a new federation of Harafe takes its place. Where the old system still allowed the outdated philosophies and self-ruining desires of the houses and their pompous leaders to reign our people back from their destined greatness, this new Federation will free us of these chains. Now is the time for Haraf to reach towards our united future in earnest, now is the time we stand together as one."
 haraf_events.12.a:0 "The strength of the Alas'gasidi will erase the mistakes of the past!"
 haraf_events.12.b:0 "The diversity of the Kinah will lead us into the future!"
 haraf_events.13.t:0 "Candidates from the Kinah"
 haraf_events.13.d:0 "The time is come for a new election within the Kinah Conclave, which of the fiver Houses shall lead us in the years to come?"
 haraf_events.13.a:0 "The righteous Alas'gasidi"
 haraf_events.13.b:0 "The strict Datai'tsel"

 #Government Reforms
 kinah_federation:0 "The Kinah Federation"
 kinah_federation_desc:0 "The Kinah Federation is a political entity uniting all of the great and minor Houses of Haraf. While the Houses have to answer to the decrees of the ruling House, they are fairly autonomous, governing their territory and determining their own foreign policy. The current Kinah Federation is the third of its name, created in 1178 by House Alas’gasidi, and is living through the aftermaths of the Period of the Decadent Chiefs, a period of unrest in the 14th and 15th centuries."
 house_leeti_haat:0 "House Leeti'haàt"
 house_leeti_haat_desc:0 "House Leeti’haát concerns itself mainly with the exploration of the great desert and the sale of the various buried trinkets of the dunes to the other Houses and ruinborn tribes. A specialty of this House is the breeding, taming and riding of sandworms from the great Haraf desert. Sandworm riders develop the skill of ‘wormwatching’ over many years - being able to detect the subtle differences of the worm’s behavior when coming into contact with hidden Precursor relics underneath the sands. Most relations with the Fograc are also put on the shoulders of this House, as the amber-eyed elves live on the other side of the sands, requiring grand expeditions to contact."
 house_datai_tsel:0 "House Datai'tsel"
 house_datai_tsel_desc:0 "House Datai’tsel is the most martial and hawkish of the Houses and its chiefs are often great military leaders. This House is most known for being home to a majority of the Neàn’auvulin and to have an army almost equivalent in size to the Alas’gasidi. They are also one of two Houses to ever defy the Alas’gasidi militarily in recent history: a failed coup in 1369 to seize control of the Federation. Despite having a rebellious history, the Datai’tsel chiefs often see eye-to-eye with the Alas’gasidi in terms of civil governance. However, the Datai’tsel view the Alas’gasidi as having grown weak and complacent in their long rule and seek the conquest of the Mayte and Kooras - along with the active extermination of the Silent Watchers"
 house_hoila_kosu:0 "House Hoila'kosu"
 house_hoila_kosu_desc:0 "House Hoila’kosu is a relatively easygoing House, rising to prominence through the sheer agricultural output they produce and ending the anarchic period of Western Haraf concurrently. Herding, hunting, farming, and fishing are all common professions here, and the House excels, thanks to the ancient knowledge of Tselayos. In what’s seen as strange and nonsensical to the other Houses, the Hoila’kosu are the only House to elect their chiefs - and by a council of the most agriculturally productive of the House."
 house_keiin_achi:0 "House Keiin'achi"
 house_keiin_achi_desc:0 "The power structure within House Keiin’achi is one of pure practicality, ungoverned by regular morality - if one is capable of stealing or killing to seize power and defend it, then they are its rightful ruler. Many in the House are gifted with strong magics, especially that of fire, and mages often become chiefs through use of their powers. They were responsible for an extremely destructive Di’iikunail heretical revolt known as “The Flaming Sorrows” that plagued all Haraf between 1400 and 1403. The revolt was eventually crushed and the chief of Alas’gasidi chose to extend mercy to many of the Keiin’achi  - much to the protest of the other Houses and Elder Singer. A group of Keiin’achi who felt great guilt from their revolt would split off from the main House and found House Diyof’dianiil."
