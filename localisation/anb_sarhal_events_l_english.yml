 sarhalevents.4.desc:0 "The morning mists still rise from the river banks when news reaches the princely palace - this year's convocation of the Jelli at the Tree of Tales has ended. Many tales have been shared, and a plethora of new poems and songs will spread all over Fangaula in the coming months. And with it the latest crop of students at the Yirisunsiir have finished their apprenticeship and have become master storytellers in their own right. Amongst them, one prodigy has caught the interest of court officials, who have been lobbying to swiftly secure his services before he catches the notice of rival courts who might well outbid us in an attempt to gain his loyalty."
 sarhalevents.4.a:0 "Let him tell tales of Aro Makaya, Kanhati and the other great totem spirits!"
 sarhalevents.4.b:0 "On second thought, we are somewhat lacking in entertainment."

 sarhalevents.5.desc:0 "While once other schools of the Jelli tradition might have challenged the primacy of the Tree of Tales, by now thanks to our continued efforts the Yirisunsiir is the undisputed heart of the Jelli craft and being granted the opportunity to study here is the dream of many a prospective Jelli. Wooden platforms and staircases left to molder in the humid climate have been restored, new teaching chambers have been constructed and formerly unremarkable structures have been adorned with delicate carvings and striking pearl inlay mosaics. We now have the pick of some of the most talented Jelli to recruit for our service."
 sarhalevents.5.a:0 "Our people might benefit from being reminded of the foundations of our faith."

 sarhalevents.6.desc:0 "It is done! After many years of toil and effort the Yirisunsiir has grown from a mere gathering place for roaming raconteurs into not only the undisputed heart of the Jelli tradition but a symbol of peaceful cooperation all over western Sarhal. Whenever there is a need for a summit location to find peaceful solutions for simmering conflicts the Tree of Tales and with it the town of Jirad is the obvious first choice. And with every new Jelli leaving the teaching halls and stages of the Yirisunsiir for the wider world its reputation only grows. And just as birds like the stork travel far away only to return each year, the Jelli bards gather in ever-increasing numbers each year to share the latest wondrous tales from faraway lands. It is only proper that we may obtain the service of the most talented among them to further our own ambitions."
 sarhalevents.6.a:0 "Our people are in dire need of spiritual guidance to calm their spirits."

 #Coven's Bargain: 20-33 written by De Sterrennacht, 34 and 35 written by Scamp
 sarhalevents.20.t:0 "Coven's Bargain: The Loan"
 sarhalevents.20.d:0 "You toss and turn in your chambers. You haven’t been able to sleep in what feels like an eternity; the state of [Root.Country.GetName] has consumed not only your waking moments, but your sleeping moments as well. You wish you could say it was entirely out of your control, but you know that can’t be true. This is your fault, and now [Root.Country.GetName] is teetering on the edge of bankruptcy. \n You drift off, and find yourself in a fog-filled marsh. Your breath hitches as you recognise the plants; this is the Shadow Swamp. You strain your eyes, and see a glimmer of gold off in the distance. Something in you takes over, some primal greed, and you scramble for the faint glimmer, running until you see a giant boulder of solid gold in front of you. You marvel at its size. If only you could take this with you out of the dream, then all [Root.Country.GetName]’s debts would be solved. But it can’t be that easy, can it? \n ‘But what if it is that easy?’ you hear someone whispering. ‘What if you could just take the gold, and everything would be better? Would it hurt to try?’"
 sarhalevents.20.a:0 "This feels off"
 sarhalevents.20.b:0 "Take the gold"
 sarhalevents.21.t:0 "Coven's Bargain: Time to Collect"
 sarhalevents.21.d:0 "You lay down in your chambers and smile. Five years to the day, you woke up from a dream you barely remember, and all of [Root.Country.GetName]’s debts were solved. You don’t fully understand how, but every creditor simply…forgot. You checked the country’s financial records and found nothing but carefully-written profit and good financial management where ruinous debt should have been scrawled in desperation. Tonight, like every night for the past five years, you sleep peacefully. \n You open your eyes, and find yourself in the Shadow Swamp again. You look around, but see no glimmer of gold. Then you try to take a step, and your legs fail to move. \n You look down. Your legs are encased in solid gold. \n You hear a distant cackle, and the same voice from five years ago speaks. ‘Because of your incompetence, you were offered a loan by myself, Ilfanill Gloomweaver. You’re very familiar with loans, I’m sure. Your creditor has come to collect. I request the prosperity of only the last three years; a very fair price, wouldn’t you say? As interest, I demand all of the future prosperity of your nation as well. Harsh, but the loan was offered to the least trustworthy debtor I’ve ever seen! And, of course, if you default, I’ll take everything I gave you. I’m sure your old creditors won’t be happy to see these debts again.’"
 sarhalevents.21.a:0 "I will not sell [Root.Country.GetName]’s future!"
 sarhalevents.21.b:0 "Pay your debts"
 sarhalevents.22.t:0 "Coven's Bargain: An Intruder"
 sarhalevents.22.d:0 "With the unrest throughout [Root.Country.GetName], your advisors have suggested you barricade the doors to your estate; you’ve taken this advice to heart. One day, as you pace your entrance hall, empty of petitioners and filled with guards, you hear a crack on your front door. Then another. Then another, then another, then your door bursts open. Your guards jump to attention, and a hulking cloaked figure steps through the opening where your door once was. It speaks in a booming voice as your guards shake in fear. ‘I can bring you peace. I can slay your enemies, crush the traitors, quell sedition. Yes or no?’"
 sarhalevents.22.a:0 "No"
 sarhalevents.22.b:0 "Yes"
 sarhalevents.23.t:0 "Coven's Bargain: A Pound of Flesh"
 sarhalevents.23.d:0 "You sit in your chambers. Your advisors have told you that the unrest that plagued your country shows signs of beginning again. The traitors within [Root.Country.GetName] arm themselves, and your rule is resisted at every turn. You hear a crack on your bedroom window, and then a loud boom, and you jump up, seeing the cloaked figure from five years ago climbing through. She flips her hood off and reveals her face; it is Hireet Smoketusk, one of the three hags of Yezel Mora, and her smile terrifies you even more than her size... ‘The pendulum swings back. What I did for you will lead to more unrest, even worse than before. Unless you pay the price. A pound of flesh from every child in [Root.Capital.GetName], and your eternal fealty.’ She licks her lips and grins even wider. ‘And a few choice morsels to myself.’"
 sarhalevents.23.a:0 "I do not need your help again!"
 sarhalevents.23.b:0 "Convert to Shadow Pact"
 sarhalevents.24.t:0 "Coven's Bargain: Nine Months After"
 sarhalevents.24.d:0 "You sigh. Your courtiers dragged you to this festival, with nobles from across the realm and many of your own family members attending. Your lack of an heir is worrying them, and they beg you every day to have a child, or to appoint a relative. But you don’t want a child, and all of your relatives are idiotic sycophants unfit to rule [Root.Country.GetName]. You’ve stayed in the corner, fending off requests to speak or dance from power-hungry relatives and attractive young women alike. Then you see her; the most beautiful woman you’ve ever seen, approaching you. She extends her arm and requests a dance, and you know you’ve fallen in love. You spend the rest of the night getting to know her in every possible sense. When you awake, however, she is gone.\n All of this happened nine months ago. Today, just outside your chambers, you see her, bearing an infant child, and you recognise his eyes as yours."
 sarhalevents.24.a:0 "I cannot raise this child, begone!"
 sarhalevents.24.b:0 "Make him my heir, and make her my queen"
 sarhalevents.25.t:0 "Coven's Bargain: Hanged"
 sarhalevents.25.d:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] was found dead in his chambers today, hanging from a noose he tied himself. His consort and heir have vanished mysteriously, leaving nothing behind, and rumours are beginning to spread that they were somehow responsible. The court is in chaos, and a distant cousin has been appointed to the throne."
 sarhalevents.25.a:0 "This bodes ill..."
 sarhalevents.26.t:0 "Coven's Bargain: Consort & Heir Vanish"
 sarhalevents.26.d:0 "After your monarch died, his consort and heir vanished mysteriously, leaving nothing behind, and rumours are beginning to spread that they were somehow responsible. The court is in chaos, and a distant cousin has been appointed to the throne."
 sarhalevents.26.a:0 "This bodes ill..."
 sarhalevents.27.t:0 "Coven's Bargain: Return of the Heir"
 sarhalevents.27.d:0 "The boy who stands before you has his father’s eyes. It makes the hatred with which he stares at you feel even more disorienting. ‘I am the rightful [Root.GetTitle] of [Root.Country.GetName], and I have come to reclaim my birthright,’ he says. ‘I have thousands of men willing to fight for me. Give me the throne, or I will take it.’\n You steal a glance at his mother in the corner. She’s flanked by armed men, and she smiles at her son. She’s dropped the disguise she used to seduce his father, and you recognise her as the hag Komina Riftwhisper, one of Yezel Mora’s rulers. You have no doubt that her son obeys her every command. If you give him the throne, he’ll follow her dark designs."
 sarhalevents.27.a:0 "He fled the nation, this throne is not his to take!"
 sarhalevents.27.b:0 "Abdicate for the rightful [Root.GetTitle]"
 sarhalevents.28.t:0 "Coven's Bargain: A Dream"
 sarhalevents.28.d:0 "You’re unfit to rule. You know that. Someone should’ve found a more suitable candidate before you became [Root.GetTitle], but no one did, and now you feel like you’re sleepwalking through ruling the country. Your advisors can’t hide their disdain for you. It’s only a matter of time before your incompetence leads to your death, and you swear you can hear footsteps around every corner. \n Tonight, you dream of a hand being offered to you, and you somehow know that if you take the hand, you won’t have to worry about your incompetence anymore."
 sarhalevents.28.a:0 "Refuse"
 sarhalevents.28.b:0 "Take the hand"
 sarhalevents.29.t:0 "Coven's Bargain: Sinking"
 sarhalevents.29.d:0 "The sensation of slowly falling jolts you awake. You look around, and see yourself sinking into black mud, your legs already below the surface. You struggle, but can’t find purchase, and only sink deeper. Eventually, only your head and one outstretched arm remain above the mud. A chill runs down your spine as you realise you can feel your intelligence draining away as you sink deeper. \n An elderly woman walks into view, standing on the black mud as if it were solid. You recognise her as the night hag Gloomweaver. She laughs. ‘Do you remember when you took a hand in your dreams all those years ago, and your incompetence disappeared? That was mine. Now, take my hand again and I’ll pull you out, if you promise to serve me forever.’"
 sarhalevents.29.a:0 "Refuse her hand, and sink below the mud"
 sarhalevents.29.b:0 "Take her hand and pull yourself out"
 sarhalevents.30.t:0 "Coven's Bargain: A Visit in the Night"
 sarhalevents.30.d:0 "Chaos reigns in your nation. Two men next to each other on the street are unlikely to pray to the same gods, and your state is being pulled every which way on matters of faith. One night, an attractive young woman appears in your bedchambers. ‘I can unite your people,’ she promises. ‘The chaos you see will become order. They will all worship at the same altar. What do you say?’"
 sarhalevents.30.a:0 "Dismiss her"
 sarhalevents.30.b:0 "Accept her offer"
 sarhalevents.31.t:0 "Coven's Bargain: Idolatry"
 sarhalevents.31.d:0 "The young woman has somehow convinced the men all over your country to cease their fighting and erect idols to the same figure: her. They all worship at her feet. Today, you heard that a fight broke out in a marketplace near [Root.Capital.GetName] over her favour, and there are rumblings that things will get worse. Two of your guards break out in a brawl in your own hall over a wink she offered one of them and not the other. She chose to visit your chambers tonight, and you can hear your advisors whispering behind your door about how you don’t deserve her favour. She pouts in displeasure and sits on your bed. ‘Everyone in this land prays to me but you. It’s enough to make a girl feel unwanted.’ She reclines, and you suddenly feel your legs becoming heavier. ‘Get down on your knees and pray, or I’ll make them fight to the death over me.’"
 sarhalevents.31.a:0 "Reject this false god and free your country from her brainwashing!"
 sarhalevents.31.b:0 "Kneel before your goddess"
 sarhalevents.32.t:0 "Coven's Bargain: The Hulking Gnoll"
 sarhalevents.32.d:0 "The reports from your regional governors are concerning. Taxes simply aren’t getting paid. Local farmers aren’t delivering their harvest quotas, local landowners aren’t paying you money and local nobles aren’t helping you solve this. One night, as you walk through your capital and focus on the only place that still respects your authority, you see a hulking gnoll out of the corner of your vision. She approaches your entourage and speaks. ‘I can make your people listen to you again. Do not ask how, just answer me. Will you accept my help or not?’"
 sarhalevents.32.a:0 "You can handle this yourself!"
 sarhalevents.32.b:0 "Accept her help"
 sarhalevents.33.t:0 "Coven's Bargain: The Children Farmers"
 sarhalevents.33.d:0 "Your people have not all obeyed you perfectly. However…their children have. As organised as experts, children have started paying taxes for their families. They deliver grain, meat, metal and gold to local governors. This is disturbing, to say the least; even more disturbing is that it seems to be working.\n One night, you come across the same gnoll from years back. She smiles, and her features shift until you recognise the hag Hireet Smoketusk, one of the three hags of Yezel Mora. ‘The children of [Root.Country.GetName] do not obey you. They obey me. Swear to obey me, and I will release my hold. Refuse, and I will make them burn the fields, salt the earth, and then kill their parents.’"
 sarhalevents.33.a:0 "I will not serve a monster like you!"
 sarhalevents.33.b:0 "Tell her that you, and your nation, are hers."
 sarhalevents.34.t:0 "Coven's Bargain: A Deal with the Shadows"
 sarhalevents.34.d:0 "Where she walked, shadows followed. The ground under her feet turned black with soot. Flanked by a pair of heavily armed men with nothing but shadows for eyes, she walked as though unseen by any guards. You knew you should not listen to her words. No deal with a creature so foul could ever be in your favour.\n\nYet in this current crisis, could one afford to refuse her offer? She promised to supply countless soldiers to aid us, each one with the solitary goal of solidifying your control over the nation. She called them her Soldiers of Shadows, and promised they would never disobey. Let this chance slip, and you could lose all power as your lands descend into anarchy."
 sarhalevents.34.a:0 "I will never make a deal with a hag!"
 sarhalevents.34.b:0 "I will use any means necessary to maintain control"
 sarhalevents.35.t:0 "Coven's Bargain: The Shadow Revolt"
 sarhalevents.35.d:0 "The Soldiers of Shadow had become integral to the ruling of the realm over the past five years. They followed orders unquestioningly, no matter how gruesome nor dangerous a task assigned to them. Their shadowy eyes did not faze you anymore. Their presence represented stability and power - power that you controlled.\n\nBut no more. One day, at sunset, each Soldier of Shadow at once turned and stabbed the nearest person to them. Then the next person. Then the next. With most of them integrated into the army, it decimated our numbers, leaving the army crippled overnight. The handful of non-shadow guards had barred the door to your chambers, and the sounds of violence were moving further away. Replacing it were the sounds of slow footsteps, creeping ever closer, each footfall snuffing out another candle in the room.\n\nAs the last candle went out, the doors swung open, and in shuffled that creature of the dark. It had been five years since she last entered this domain, but your research in that time meant you now knew her name: Hireet Smoketusk. A Night Hag of the Yezel Mora coven. She cackled, and pointed a single warty finger at you. 'I am here to receive my payment. Either you make a pact with the shadows, or my soldiers will continue their rampage until I have seen enough suffering.'""
 sarhalevents.35.a:0 "Curse you Smoketusk! Begone from this place!"
 sarhalevents.35.b:0 "I submit to you. Call off your soldiers"
