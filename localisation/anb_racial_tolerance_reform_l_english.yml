As this term limit has been reached, the highest ranking officials of the state have assembled to prepare for a peaceful transition of power. Our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], aware of his term’s imminent end, has already begun preparations to retire from office and end [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] long and successful tenure. After such a long period it is finally time for a change of the head of state."
