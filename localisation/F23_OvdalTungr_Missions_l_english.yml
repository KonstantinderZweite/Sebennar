 flavor_ovdaltungr.2.d:0 "Bulwar was first ruled by the Bulwari humans, then came the steppe nomads, then came the vile Gnollish kingdoms, then came the knife eared elves. Soon the continent was a mess with all these races, plus a decent number of greenskins all competing for control. Never before has Bulwar had a Dwarven ruler, until now. Some call the dwarves the clock-work race and we hope to bring a measure of stability and efficiency to the ruined continent. For all will be well under the Bronze Sun of Odval Tungr."

 flavor_ovdaltungr.4.t:0 "The Servator"
 flavor_ovdaltungr.4.d:0 "The machine began to glow and whirl around while the lord mayor and his company let out a combined cheer of triumph. Yet as the machine began to come online something funny started to happen, the air gained a wierd odor and the vault doors leading to the facility shut without any input. At first they thought it was a joke or malfunction laughing at the absurdity of it all, but then the first dwarf hit the floor wheezing until he died. Soon the remaining company was banging on the door trying to get the guards outside to open the door, but little did they know the gaurds outside had already been gunned down by security turrents previously unknown to the dwarves. Eventually the banging stopped and the doors were opened with a one lone figure emerging, it was the lord mayor but something was different about them. They had a glazed look on their face and a large sheet of copper had been installed onto their skull. The lord mayor calmly, with the personhood drained from them walked up the thousands of steps to the top of Ovdal Tungr. Over this time the Mayor could hear the screams errupting from all over the hold as old defense systems were activated and any dissadent dwarves were liquidated before news could spread. Finally after nearly 2 hours of walking the Mayor emerged at the surface of the hold, smiling as he called out to the guards on duty to march with him towards the assembly. ... People outside of Ovdal Tungr will remember this as the day that dwarven democracy in Bulwar died, but to those inside the realm a far worse fate was about to comense. For the hold of Ovdal Tungr was not flooded all those years ago on accident, it was a deliberate meassure taken to stop an entity that the Dwarves of old regaurded as a monster that could destroy all that they knew. ... Long live the Servator."

 flavor_ovdaltungr.5.d:0 "The people of Odval Tungr expect a democracy where the Dwarves and priviliged people of our empire have a say over how they are governed. This system of running things will not work for the Servator and so a dictaorship with the shadow of the Servator looming behind it is what will be installed. They will grow angry due to this, but so long as the truth is concealed it shouldn't be too bad.

 flavor_ovdaltungr.6.t:0 "Mithril Foundries"
 flavor_ovdaltungr.6.d:0 "The legions of Odval Tungr need more and more rare materials in order to equip their complex weapons. One of these resources, mithril, lies deep in the serpentspine and requires great effort to procure through expensive trading pacts. We cannot afford this, but as Dwarves we can acquire information from Dwarven smiths in the Serpentspine on their process of Mithril production. It turns out a few places in the highlands of Bulwar have the mineral composition to create a metalic compoud very similar to Mithril. With this information, we too can begin producing this rare metal in our own territory and save so much money."
