 flavour_isagumze.1.d:0 "The Kulugi Abe are the traditional nobility of Isagumze, and have long competed for influence over the goverment with the foreign Medawor and the more reformist elements of the native nobility.

 flavour_isagumze.7.t:0 "God in flesh and scales?"
 flavour_isagumze.7.d:0 "You are about to leave, but one of the priests in the delegation suddenly stops in his tracks. Piecing together some comments Aakhet made, and the fact that his human appearance today looks very similar to some portrayals and descriptions of Nyokyora, the priest has come to a shocking conclusion, Aakhet is Nyokyora! The delegation explodes in a chaotic mix of shock, indignation and confusion. Meanwhile, Aakhet merely chuckles, and says he was wondering how much would it take for someone to figure it out."

 flavour_isagumze.9.d:0 "Oh Zerat, how glorious must the ancient city have been when it stood as the heart of the great empire of the lizardfolk, and how low it had fallen under the rule of those that refused to admit their time had ended. Nothing more than an old rotten heart that stubbornly keeps beating, futilely trying to delay the unstoppable flow of fate.\n\nBut that ends now, our troops have been let loose in the city, with orders to leave no brick standing on top of another and no lizard spared. When the sacking is over the city will have been purified, the great spire left as the only thing standing intact on top of charred ruins, our bravest soldiers adorned with the scales of its stubborn defenders.\n\nWho can deny our claim to the eternal empire now, when we have torn down the last remnant of the last one?

 isagumze_scaled_lords_reform_desc:0 "With the bizarre medasi compromise abolished, the nation is now ruled by a council of the 5 most powerful Kulugi Abe families, the Scaled Lords. The head of this council, who receives the name of Scaled Speaker, is selected each decade via a ritualized wrestling competition, in which candidates of the five families compete to determine who is the most worthy to lead the Ikilshebe. The winner, having proven himself to be the chosen of Nyokyora, will fill this position for 10 years, after which a new Scaled Speaker will be elected."
