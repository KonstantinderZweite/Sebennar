 selphereg_splendor_of_spring_court_desc:0 "Although we are the center of arts and culture, that is not enough. In order to channel the power bestowed unto us by the Fey Lords, we must commission a new and glorious temple in our capital. Surely then there will be no more doubt that we are paramount."
 selphereg_protector_of_selpheregi_title:0 "Protector of the Spring"
 selphereg_protector_of_selpheregi_desc:0 "Our name now legendary, synonymous with only the finest of culture, it is only natural that we should endeavour to educate our lesser Selpheregi cousins in our fine arts. What is a master without an apprentice?"

 selphereg_stewardship_of_seasons_title:0 "Stewardship of the Seasons"
 selphereg_stewardship_of_seasons_desc:0 "Although useful, allies are fickle and as fleeting as the first blossom of Spring.

 selphereg_precursor_expeditons_title:0 "Precursor Expeditions"
 selphereg_precursor_expeditons_desc:0 "Underneath our feet and above our minds, the legacy of the Precursor is the foundation of our daily lives. Without the efforts of our ancient ancestors, we would surely left behind in the primitive state of the other Ruinborn. We must expand our efforts in understanding our ancestors, for they have left us an invaluable guiding hand. We need only unearth their buried gifts."
 selphereg_renovate_arakeprun_title:0 "Renovate Arakeprun"
 selphereg_renovate_arakeprun_desc:0 "Due to the Goldtree rebellion, the grand city of Arakeprun has been cut off from the guidance of the ancestors. Without them, the city has stagnated. Let us utilize our resources to restore Arakeprun to its former glory."
 selphereg_vernal_arts_title:0 "Sponsor the Vernal Arts"
 selphereg_vernal_arts_desc:0 "The Vernal Arts is a school of aesthetic thought, focusing around the interaction of natural beauty with artificial objects.

The state should sponsor this style and its artists, and as a result promote creativity and innovation."
