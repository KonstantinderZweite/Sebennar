 flavor_arvezl.3.d:0 "Ever since the Third Ynnic Civil War, the frontiers of the Empire were pushed back by barbarian raids; border towns were abandoned as their inhabitants sought protection in the hinterland.\n\nOn the Arverynn river, Arvezl stands as the good River-worshiping Ynnics' easternmost settlement. However, we can change that by launching a campaign to subjugat- er, vassalize the tribes to our immediate east. Of course, we will need funds, and the support of our liege lord."

 flavor_arvezl.4.d:0 "An ambitious proposal has been presented to us by the [From.Monarch.GetTitle] of Arvezl. Ever since the Third Ynnic Civil War, the frontiers of the Empire were pushed back by barbarian raids; border towns were abandoned as their inhabitants sought protection in the hinterland.\n\nOn the Arverynn river, Arvezl stands as the good River-worshiping Ynnics' easternmost settlement. However, its [From.Monarch.GetTitle] aims to change that by embarking on a dare-devilish campaign to vassalize the tribes that inhabit the bogs of the Arverynn's forks and occupy the fertile farmlands between the Cydynn and Heranynn rivers.\n\nHaving presented our bureaucrats with the most meticulous action plan, featuring a thorough list of possible approaches to secure the fealty of each tribe through either pleasantry or hostility - and several contingencies for every step of the way - [From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] of Arvezl has concluded [From.Monarch.GetHerHis] audience by underlining the economical and prestige benefits that rulership over such an area - which most cartographers historically regard as part of Sarda - would bring to the House of [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName]."
