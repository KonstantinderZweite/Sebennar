 G48_learning_from_the_best_desc:0 "Traditionally, we have not had to worry about having a major naval presence. Any overseas expeditions have been handled by our Nékhei, Anisikheion. While our clans forge weapons and smith armor, Anisikheion has patrolled the seas and developed naval tactics we could not dream of. Despite their strength, we cannot rely on them alone. We have begun an initiative of reforming our fleets and our admiralty, basing it off of their organization. With our combined might, we will make sure our interests are protected."

 G48_the_pearl_boom_desc:0 ""I hope this letter finds you well, [G59.Monarch.GetName] [G59.Monarch.GetTitle] of [G59.GetName],\nI thank you for your cooperation with the training exercises; a plethora of promising new recruits have been identified in the past several years. Now, it is time for us to return the favor to you. Attached to this letter is a decree authorizing you to use the Forge Council’s treasury to expand the local trade and the pearl industry. I expect a report on the results within the next three months, so do not disappoint.\nSincerely, Ardores of the Galangenea clan"\n-Letter acquired from the Aniskheion Civic Archive; approx. date 1446-1449."

 G48_cleaved_dominance_desc:0 "The Cleaved Sea has long been dominated by Ormam. With the fall of Ormam, there is a power vacuum that has not been present in centuries. With this power vacuum comes opportunity, and responsibility that must be borne. That is where we come in. Using our admiralty training, the funds gained from the sack of the kheion, and the money obtained through smithing, we can forge a great fleet and expand our markets to support more trade, cleaving our way to naval and economic dominance of the seas."

 G48_breaking_the_merchants_desc:0 ""Bastards. Traitors. These Ormami are that and so, so much more. There may be nobody left alive that remembers the Betrayal of Kherka, but the economic impact has been felt for centuries. It is time to set the score right with those treacherous sea dogs. The longer we let those backstabbers control the sea, the longer our trade is threatened. As long as they are still ruling, Kherkan trade will never be secured and our nation may never be safe."\n- Adrahelhos Artogenea, Address to the Ekitka Hall, 11/11/1444."

 G48_contenders_no_more_title:0 "Contenders No More"
 G48_contenders_no_more_desc:0 "The Degabhen thundered through Kheios, locking spear by spear, shield against shield, and buckler on buckler. But they met their match with us. Soldiers may be the arms of the city, protecting it from external threats. But craftsmen are the blood which give it life. The Degabhen nobles claimed to be masters of Kkheion, guardians of the real, and the only citizens of their city. They spurned the craftsmen which made Kherka so great. So let us enlist the Karkares of the city to serve us as a new phylaxana in burnished rows of fresh forged steel, and place them under the Artogenéa. "

 G48_shift_the_tide_title:0 "Shift The Tide"
 G48_shift_the_tide_desc:0 "The mighty Degárikes were to be feared and won the Sea Wars for the Oktibhen. But they sank in the wine-dark Sea during their Second Expedition, dooming thousands of their citizens to a watery grave.\n\nWe will rebuild these ships, stronger, better, faster. We will smelt iron, the hardest of all substances, to brace a new class of Degárikes. We will brace hulls with sorcerous metals, fixed with nails forged in the heat of Mount Coskheis. These ships will give us command of the sea and secure the route to our loyal subject Anisíkheion."

 G48_gaining_an_edge_title:0 "Gaining An Edge"
 G48_gaining_an_edge_desc:0 "Throughoutout our history we have had a tumultuous relationship with the city of Lokemeion. In ancient times they were an important member of The Kherkan League, but also the first to break away from it; since then a tense rivalry has existed between us, many times coming close to open war. It's time we end it, and integrate their city intoto our nation for good. That would also have the added benefit of giving us control of the Degalistéa, the library home to the greatest collection of ancient books and documents in Alecand; many of our clans have expressed great interest in it."

 G48_better_bronze_title:0 "Better Bronze"
 G48_better_bronze_desc:0 "The Barbarians to our west are said to have vast amounts of copper and many clever techniques in working it. While some Barbhen bronze working can't possibly compete with our mastery of iron, integrating their knowledge of bronze can still improve our forging abilities. Convincing their best smiths won't be hard - any master of the craft, even an uncivilized one, will recognize our art."

 G48_divining_ores_title:0 "Divining Ores"
 G48_divining_ores_desc:0 "Our mines are many and deep, our miners strong and tireless, but the need for more raw metals is ever-expanding. The Forge-Council is deeply aware of this - many of the recent debates are centered around the best way to find more mineral sources. The Serogenéa clan have consistently assured the council that our mountains are still full of untapped deposits, but the issue up to now up to now was discovering them. Finally, yesterday a newly elected councilor from the Irenthegenéa Clan came forward with a bold new idea: to use divination magic to find the deposits - and extend the spell across the whole island.\nTo reach such a scale we'll need magical infrastructure, and knowledge that can only be obtained from the masters of Kheios magic: Arpedifér."

 G48_looking_beyond_title:0 "Looking Beyond"
 G48_looking_beyond_desc:0 "As our Nekheis has expanded inland, more and more reports from Mteibas Valley are arriving to the council. Its inhabitants seem to be much more organized than the rest of the Devandi tribes; more importantly, these Mteibhar appear to have the ability to forge iron and gems with incredible skill.\n\nMany in the Council are skeptical after the Eltikan debacle, but we can't pass up the chance to improve our craft, even if the odds are slim. A diplomatic expedition won't be a big burden, after all."

 G48_our_lifeblood_title:0 "Our Lifeblood"
 G48_our_lifeblood_desc:0 "The first step in forging is one that’s often overlooked, and yet is the most important step. You need to obtain the ore in the first place!  It can be a very tedious task, but one that is absolutely necessary. The Serogenea clan has proposed to the Forge Council a partnership with the merchant guilds.  The merchant guilds will supply the Serogenea with more mining tools and safety equipment, while the Serogenea clan supplies the merchants with ores they dig, which the merchants will then sell to the rest of the clans at discounted government-subsidised prices."

 G48_beginning_of_new_heights_desc:0 "Money begets money. By focusing our effort on improving the infrastructures and facilities in our historical lands, more investments will flow in: from the Forge-Clans, from merchants looking for new avenues of profit, from thoseeose common citizens sufficiently well-off to not be worried aboutofabout theirir next meal. The Nestegenéa Clan have made this their main selling point in their push to provide the next Kylakas. "You will see a flowering of new mines, forges, shops," they promise."

 G48_an_Iron_tide_title:0 "An Iron Tide"
 G48_an_Iron_tide_desc:0 "Now that the rock has started rolling we're not gonna let it stop. A new wave of forges, weaponsmiths and armourer workshops have opened for business, but it's not enough. We need to keep pushing to increase production, until we flood the Alecand market with metal, until the other Kheions' blacksmiths are forced to close shop, unable to compete with our quality and prices. Should we then find ourselves at war, we can rely on our smiths to quickly switch every kiln to the war effort under the Odégaster Cogémos edict; something that only we are able to do, thanks to our industrial prowess."

 G48_center_of_industry_title:0 "Center Of Industry"
 G48_center_of_industry_desc:0 "To bring our nation to the heights we have now reached, we have been forced to rely on external funding, mostly from rich merchants. But merchants are fickle; we can't trust them with our forges' control. And we don't need them anymore, we have the funds ourselves now. We'll build new blacksmiths and forges and workshops, of a scale never seen before. And it will all be owned by the nation of Kherka, now and forever."

 G48_metal_in_our_blood_title:0 "Metal In Our Blood"
 G48_metal_in_our_blood_desc:0 "This year's Master of Metals is different from the previous festivals. After decades of expanding and refining our crafting capabilities, integrating new techniques from whoever possessed something we could learn from, adding new raw materials to be molded, our Forge Council has officially proclaimed that no other nation in the world can surpass our skills in metalworking. What have we accomplished? More than forging weapons and tools, we've forged a legacy. Our armories overflow with weapons and equipment, our workshops craft the finest gems in the Kheionai, and our Terramancers bend metal to perfection. Countless blades, armor, and ornaments stand as proof of Kherka’s unmatched skill and pride.\n\nYet, this is just the beginning. The flames of our forges will not falter. The work ahead is vast—more weapons to defend our lands, more tools to shape our future, and more masterpieces to affirm Kherka as the undisputed master of metals."

 G48_the_mountain_that_gives_title:0 "The Mountain That Gives"
 G48_the_mountain_that_gives_desc:0 "Located to the west of the city of Kherka, the Metei mountain climbs up high into the sky, and it’s theorized it stretches miles down below the surface. This mountain has protected us before from the deathwinds, and has provided us with great gems and riches. We ask for it to provide for us once more, to fuel our economy. A project has been proposed to expand the wealth of the cities by launching expeditions deep into the mines. To ensure the safety of our miners and to expedite such expeditions, we will send five thousand troops, supplied and armed with explosives, spears, lanterns and pickaxes, down into the dark."

 G48_shimmer_from_the_top_desc:0 "The peculiar gems we found in the depth of the Mtei Mines are quickly becoming all the rage among elites across Alecand. We must exploit this while it lasts, by expanding the mines even further and tapping all the gems' deposits. There's serious money to be had!"

flavour_kherka.1.t:0 "Enemies At The Gate"
flavour_kherka.1.d:0 ""Do you not see that the time to act is now?" Adrahelhos, main representative of the Artogenea clan, held the floor, preaching to the Ektika hall. "We are surrounded by enemies to the north and the south! We must strike first, before our city gets burnt to the ground again, or even worse, fully subjugated under our rivals!"\n\nThe clan representatives murmured amongst themselves, discussing Adrahelhos’ proposal.  One representative stepped forward. "How exactly do you propose we go about this?" It was Erlanilus, hailing from the Varagenéa clan, historical moderates and rivals of the Artogenea clan. "We have no claim to their cities. If we were just to march into their cities like you said, we would enrage not just our enemies, but our allies and our people!"\nThe clans fell into discussion again, a sea of murmurs, until another voice rang out. It was Darandiles, a representative of the Kelasgenea clan, who had been standing next to Adrahelhos as he gave his speech.\n\n"I have a plan for this, if the council were to approve it. There are some members in the Kelasgenea clan who wish to go undercover in both the north and the south for our cause.  With the council’s will, we will have them go on a mission to secure the legitimacy of our war. All that we need is your approval."\n\nOnce again the hall floor burst into discussion, the hubbub rising, as Adrahelhos and Darandiles shared a knowing look. Adrahelhos was about to step forward, when Vyranos Artogenea, the Kylakas, leader of the Forge Council, stood up in front of him and stepped forward to address the hall. The discussion gradually died as they all looked to what Vyranos had to say. \n\n"All in favor of Adrahelhos’ plan, cast your vote here." He gestured to one box on the side.\n"All against, cast your vote here." He gestured to another voting box opposite.\nBy the time all the votes were counted, the path was clear; Darandiles’ plan took three-quarters of the vote."

flavour_kherka.2.d:0 "Darandiles stood among the ruins of Ormam, looking over what remained of the city. It had already been a day since the defenders surrendered, and yet the acrid smoke still hung low in the city. He walked through the streets, walking until he stumbled upon the destroyed market. This place was where trade used to flow, but now it would serve as a reminder of what happens to those who betray the Kherkans.\n\nHe smirked, remembering all of the gold that his soldiers had looted from the markets over the past day. Truth be told, Darandiles couldn’t care less about ancient rivalries. The main thing he cared about was filling his pockets, and this would do so nicely. Additionally, with Ormam’s dirty merchants out of commission, and with funds secured from the sack of Ormam, Kherka was in a prime position to dominate trade.\n\nDarandiles grabbed a golden coin from the ground, picking it up and looking it over. With all of this gold, he knew that at least he and his clan would be safe. He pocketed the piece, and looked around again at the smoldering ruins. With this destruction and these riches, others would think twice before trying to betray his city again."

flavour_kherka.3.d:0 "Oktikheon was the birthplace of the trimene, and its ships cut through the water like sharks. But the city was as fractious as the sea, with kings and philosophers and tyrants rising and falling like the waves. Of course they would fall before our might. Yet there is strength in the sea as well, as any sailor could tell you, and strength among the Oktibhen. As we mix metals to make stronger alloys, we will mix the Oktibhen’s ways with our own to build a stronger kheion.\n\nThe gifts of Oktikheon are a gift to all of us, but a gift to one forge-clan in particular. The Galengenéa have always looked east towards our colony and the lands of the Devand. Now that we have expanded the shipyards of Anisikheion and Oktikheon, they dream of building Degárikes like the ones of old with assistance from our new citizens. These ships will not be sharks of the sea; instead they will serve as mobile forts, boasting artillery, mage corps and archers to crush our foes. With these at our command we will rule the Cleaved Sea and the waters beyond!"

flavour_kherka.4.t:0 "Scrolls Of Knowledge"
flavour_kherka.4.d:0 "With Lokemeion firmly in our hands a debate has started in our government on what to do with the wealth of knowledge preserved in the Degalistéa.\n\nThe Darasgenéa and the Kelasgenéa clans, always the practical sort, want to empty the library, study the tomes that look more immediately useful, and sell the rest - they already have a list of buyers ready. The Artogenéa clan also is in favor of this idea, though they wish to keep the treatises of military theory closely guarded.\nThe Varagenéa, always the cautious voice, warns against this plan, reminding everyone who would listen of the library phantasm, its powerful protector, known to castigate library goers for even minor infractions. What would happen if we were to empty its library? A catastrophe could befall us - better to leave everything as it is.\n\nFinally, the Irenthegenéa want the Council's support for an in-depth study of all the books and scrolls of the library; a world of knowledge will be our reward, they promise."

Our fault really, we shouldn't have been expecting anything from a nation of hog riders.\n\nWell, we'll still add them to our repertoire; they have some uses, and their best smiths, while lacking in knowledge, have good hands. After learning from us for a bit they will make a nice addition to our forges.\n\nWhat didn't disappoint were their highlands: they’re a veritable trove full of copper, the likes of which our miners have never seen before.\nThe Taelagenéa have already claimed most of the area's mines for themselves (with the agreement that they would reinvest part of the profits in public building projects) and their skills are already showing, for the mines’ output is rapidly increasing."

After finding it in one of the Arpedifér library's scrolls, our mages have already cast a weak version of it as a test, and everything went well. For the real deal it has been decided to "convince" some Arpedifér mages to collaborate with ours - if we could manage to conscript Zaleria it would be best, but even some apprentice of hers would suffice…\n\nIt's done! And it worked! A scrying circle as big as our island! Our mages annotated on a map all the ore veins the spell found and we're absolutely spoiled for choice, there's thousands of them!"

flavour_kherka.7.d:0 "As we arrived at the mouth of the valley, led by the Basobhar guide, many of its inhabitants appeared, converging from various directions out of rough and steep trails hidden to the untrained eye. Unlike the Basobhar tribesmen, most of them sported elaborate clothes and armour and seemed completely unbothered by our arrival; rather, they looked at us with a mixture of curiosity and impatience.\n\nJoining our flanks like at a procession, they led us farther along to reach a narrow point of the valley where, at the sides of the road, two imposing and beautifully intarsiated columns gave the feeling of a great gate protecting the interior. But no walls nor towers were present; the columns were seemingly only of symbolic nature.Just across the threshold, a new company was waiting for us; several soldiers escorted two richly dressed older men, who stepped towards us,  the younger of the two saluting us in our language, albeit heavily accented.\n\nAfter a brief exchange with the head of our expedition - Aldarious Konda, of the Galengenéa Clan - we were all invited to follow them along the road, to travel to their village in the center of the valley. As soon as the last of us passed through the columns, four elves arrived, distinct from the others for the peculiar patterns tattooed on their arms and legs. They performed a sequence of different stances, always with the hands keeping contact with a column; after a couple of minutes, from the earth a wall started to rise, quickly towering over us - it could very well have been over ten meters high!\n\n-Taken from the report of the Mteibharan expedition"

flavour_kherka.8.d:0 "To the honourable Forge-Councillors:\nThe diplomatic mission is proceeding smoothly, albeit a bit slowly. The locals' hospitality has been impeccable, almost too effusive, even. Me and the men are constantly invited to ceremonies under huge Gingko trees, banquets -every clan must have us as guests- and festivities of all kinds, to the point that collecting information related to the main purpose of the expedition has been somewhat hampered.\n\nStill, looking at the quality and overabundance of gems and metal objects of all kinds, it's clear these people possess great skills in the art of forging; by conversing with them I've discovered their smiths work side by side with the local mages. Those folk, who call themselves Terramancers, are specialized in manipulating the earth, and their look is closer to our athletes than our mages. Together with the smiths they seem to weave the metal like a thread, to craft with a precision unattainable even by our greatest artisans.\n\nI'm already encouraging the Forge-Council to draft a treaty with the Mteibhar and invite some of their Terramancers to Kherka, but I'll be able to deliver more accurate information in a week, as I've managed to convince them to show me one of their bigger forges.I've refrained from rushing our hosts about this, however, as I believe it's in our best interests to maintain the most cordial of relations with the people of Mteibhara. After that, I'll start looking to arrange a visit to their mines; I predict the whole mission will have to be prolonged to accommodate that; we'll have to stay in the valley at least another month, if they'll have us.\n\n-Aldarious Konda, Senior Diplomat."

All the Councillors agree that a friendly relationship with the good elves of Mteibhara is of paramount importance for our nation, and we hope the Delaths of the valley agree with us…"\n\n"Aldarious, my friend," voiced the eldest Rabulath "We don't care for all this lip-flapping - give us the gist of it. What do your leaders want from us?"\n\n"Your Terramancers. A few of them, to be precise, for our forges. You see, elder, our Kheion is centered around our blacksmiths and our mines; new ways to improve our metalworking will always catch the attention of the whole city. In exchange, the Council is offering our friendship and access to our knowledge and technologies, which - excuse me for the bluntness - are, in most fields, much more advanced thantn what you possess here.."\nA chorus of discordant voices erupted in the great lodge, each with a different opinion, every Rabulath speaking for his Delath - as different from each of the others as the Kheions are.\n\n"One last thing," shouted the Kherkan diplomat. "I hate to mention it, as it sounds more of a threat than advice, but in the Forge-Council we have clans who'd love nothing more than resorting to violence to get what Kherka wants, should this offer be refused. I tell you this from the heart, for I've come to love the Valley and its people; take this offer, it's a good one.""

I hope the Council will see fit to confirm my post here.\n\n- Aldarious Konta, (self-appointed) Kherkan ambassador in Mteibhara"

flavour_kherka.11.d:0 "To the honourable Forge-Councillors:\nSad news. The Rabulaths have decided not to  agree to our terms. Terramancy is more than a school of magic to them; it's a gift from Nahrei, their creation spirit (a deification of nature and the valley) and they are thus very reluctant to share the discipline secrets with outsiders.\n\nThey still offer their friendship and alliance; even if some of you may think these to be worthless to us, I believe given some time we can win enough of their trust to convince them to share their geomantic skills with us. The alternative is needless bloodshed - and it wouldn't be just our blood to spill. Don't mistake these people for the Basobhar our Nekheis dealt with: they have military equipment on par with any Kheion, and the Valley will be a giant trap for anybody who doesn't know the terrain.\nI'll stay here to try and smooth things over.\n\n- Aldarious Konta, senior diplomat."

The expedition into the depths of Metei was doing very well, yet his group had not had any good luck. The other commanders had all found various deposits of iron, copper, and various gems, yet he worried that he was going to have to report back to the current Kylakas that his section of the mines had run dry.\n\nThat was until he saw a strange glint, flickering in his lantern light from a corner in which one of the miners was working. Améthys quickly walked over to see where the shine came from, and approaching began to make out a deep purple gem that his worker had just dug up. "What… is that?" He asked, admiring it. "It’s beautiful." The miner shrugged, indifference permanently stuck on his face.\n\nAméthys looked at the purple gem, a grin creeping onto his face. "Thank you for finding this…" Améthys looked at the gem, thinking about what to name this discovery -- "...Pafyphin!" He said to the miner, who had just gone back to mining, revealing more of this gem. Améthys began pacing through his section of the mines, hungry for more of the purple gem. If the rest of his section had more of this Pafyphin, he was going to be looking at one hell of a bonus. \nAs the days passed by, more and more Pafyphin was discovered all throughout the mines, and was eventually mined and transported up en-masse."

forge_council_reform_desc:0 "The Forge Council is made up of the ten Forge-Clans, with five representatives from each forge clan elected to the council. There are four unofficial but prominent blocs within the Forge Council: The Stalwarts, Schemers, Militants, and Colonists. Each clan usually falls within one of these general tendencies. Any member of the Council is eligible to be elected Kylakas if they garner sufficient support, though the common practice is for each bloc to prop up one of their own, so that their interests may be served."
