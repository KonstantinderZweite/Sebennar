 A93_secrets_of_silk_title:0 "Secrets of Silk"
 A93_secrets_of_silk_desc:0 "The elves of the Redglades produce a fine fabric known as 'silk', which is wildly popular amongst our clothiers and designers. Surely our most beautiful elven courtesan could seduce the secrets of this fabric out of one of their experts..."
 A93_ramp_up_silk_title:0 "Produce More Silk"

 A93_mercenary_relations_title:0 "Mercenary Relations"
 A93_mercenary_relations_desc:0 "We have many ties to the mercenary companies of Cannor, and it would be for the best if we cultivated these. An effort to solidify these ties, and forge new ones where possible, would enable us to hire mercenaries on a far more reasonable budget than others."
 A93_new_pinklady_band_title:0 "New Pinklady Band"
 A93_new_pinklady_band_desc:0 "Of all the mercenaries we keep in contact with, it is the Pinklady Band that is our most loyal friend.

 A93_standing_army_title:0 "Pursuing Our Claims"
 A93_standing_army_desc:0 "The Grand Duchies of Dameria and Esmaria have both collapsed following the Lilac Wars. A period of such chaos gives us excellent opportunities to pursue our claims and perhaps solidify ourselves as the true successors of the síl Esmarainé dynasty, above the country yokels of the síl Leslinpár and glorified stewards of the síl Themarenn dynasties. To do this, of course, will require an army."
 A93_minor_nuisance_title:0 "A Minor Nuisance"

 A93_halfling_dye_title:0 "Our Own Dyes"
 A93_halfling_dye_desc:0 "Currently, our fashion industry is reliant on dye imported from the city of Viswall.
