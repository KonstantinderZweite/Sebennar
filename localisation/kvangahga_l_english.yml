 kvangahga_events.6.d:0 "To placate the mass of enslaved peoples in our land the Priest-Smith’s have introduced the Trial of the Reforged Chain. Any slave may attempt to win their freedom by forging their own chains into a weapon of their choice which they will use in a series of trials. However, as the trials require them to reforge their chains, any failure in their weapon is counted as having broken their chains as an escaped slave, and thus upon failure would be punished accordingly."
