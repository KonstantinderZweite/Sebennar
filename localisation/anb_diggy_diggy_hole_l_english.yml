  diggy.1.t:0 "[Root.GetName] Hold"
  diggy.1.d:0 "After many years of effort, we have finally finished the new districts of our Hold. This feat of architecture and engineering offers us many opportunities for expansion in the future."
  diggy.1.a:0 "[Root.strikeTheEarth] strike the [Root.swearAtTheEarth] earth!"

  diggy.2.t:0 "Demands of Labour"
  diggy.2.d:0 "With the construction of our Hold continuing, one cannot help but think it could be done at a faster pace. Though it may be quite an expensive undertaking, if we were to devote yet more of our nation's resources to meeting the various demands of construction, we could surely have our hold completed in record time!"
  diggy.2.a:0 "Construction is paramount, no matter the cost"
  diggy.2.b:0 "Everything seems to be fine as it is"

  diggy.3.t:0 "A Beautiful Hold"
  diggy.3.d:0 "With continual advancements of hold construction in [Root.GetName], several prominent members of our more artistic community: artists, stonecarvers, and various others, have brought a proposal to the forefront. As a demonstration of our culture, they say, our hold too must in and of itself be a work of art. To implement this would surely take large amounts of time and resources away from other projects, but perhaps, like all art, true beauty is worth the price?"
  diggy.3.a:0 "Let us build a beautiful hold"
  diggy.3.b:0 "Operations will continue as before"

  diggy.4.t:0 "Military Labourers"
  diggy.4.d:0 "Though many are willing to work to construct our great hold, there are limited numbers of those willing to work. Yet, it seems that we have a vast, untapped labour supply in the form of our army. Using military personnel for construction would certainly help the process, but our generals worry about the impact this move could have on our military readiness. So, we must choose our priorities: our hold, or our army?"
  diggy.4.a:0 "Our army is worthless if it has nothing to defend"
  diggy.4.b:0 "Our hold is worthless if there is no one to defend it"

  diggy.5.t:0 "Apatite Layer"
  diggy.5.d:0 "Apatite is best known for its use as an index mineral, with a hardness of 5 in the Dwohs Hardness Scale. It is usually green in color, but can be yellow, brown, blue, purple, pink, or colorless. These colors are often so vivid that apatite has frequently been cut as a gemstone. Apatite is a brittle material. It breaks by both fracture and cleavage, but the cleavage is generally indistinct.\n\nWe've faced such a mineral while digging, should we keep digging through it?"
  diggy.5.a:0 "OF COURSE!"
  diggy.5.b:0 "We can't handle the cost, let's find another way"

  diggy.6.t:0 "Orthoclase Layer"
  diggy.6.d:0 "Orthoclase is a feldspar mineral, one of the most abundant rock-forming minerals of the continental crust. Orthoclase is most widely encountered as the pink feldspar found in many granites and is assigned a hardness of "6" in the Dwohs hardness scale.\n\nOur brave miners have encountered such a mineral while digging, what should we do?"
  diggy.6.a:0 "We shall not slow down!"
  diggy.6.b:0 "Let's find another path"

  diggy.7.t:0 "Iron Pyrite Layer"
  diggy.7.d:0 "Pyrite is a brass-yellow mineral with a bright metallic luster, and is the most common sulfide mineral. It forms at high and low temperatures and occurs, usually in small quantities, in igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary rocks worldwide. Pyrite is so common that many dwarven geologists would consider it to be an ubiquitous mineral. Such a material is now in our way."
  diggy.7.a:0 "No Pyrite shall block our way!"
  diggy.7.b:0 "Try to dig through another path"

  diggy.8.t:0 "Spinel Layer"
  diggy.8.d:0 "Spinel is an oxide mineral (7.5 to 8 on the Dwohs Hardness Scale) and is often found in octahedral crystals. It is typically found in three geologic situations: As crystals in limestones and dolomites that have been subjected to contact metamorphism; as irregularly-shaped grains in basic igneous rocks; and as water-worn pebbles in alluvial deposits. It seems we have found a huge deposit of it in the way of our digging operations."
  diggy.8.a:0 "What's the problem? Dig through it!"
  diggy.8.b:0 "Maybe we should rethink our strategy..."

  diggy.9.t:0 "Corundum Layer"
  diggy.9.d:0 "Corundum is a rock-forming mineral that is found in igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary rocks, with a value of 9 on the Dwohs Hardness Scale. The mineral is widely known for its extreme hardness and for the fact that it is sometimes found as beautiful transparent crystals in many different colors. The extreme hardness makes corundum an excellent abrasive, and when that hardness is found in beautiful crystals, you have the perfect material for cutting gemstones.\n\nWe've encountered a massive layer of it. How should we proceed ?"
  diggy.9.a:0 "Nothing shall stop us."
  diggy.9.b:0 "Maybe if we go a little more to the left..?"

  diggy.10.t:0 "Carbonadwo Layer"
  diggy.10.d:0 "Carbonadwo diamonds are a rare and unusual variety of diamond. When found in the field, they look nothing like any other type of diamond. They are dark, opaque, porous, and often display a subtle luster. They are composed almost entirely of microcrystalline diamonds in random crystallographic orientations. The name "black diamond" is sometimes used for carbonadwo, however that name should technically be reserved for diamonds with a black body color caused by clouds of tiny black inclusions or by carbonization of fracture surfaces.\n\nThis is the hardest layer we've ever encountered, a 10 on the Dwohs Hardness Scale."
  diggy.10.a:0 "Finally, a worthy opponent!"
  diggy.10.b:0 "I don't want our battle to be legendary..."

  diggy.11.t:0 "Having a Blast"
  diggy.11.d:0 "Several mining engineers have come to us over the last few days with a single word on their minds: explosives. We aren't sure how safe these explosives are, or even how our engineers even got their hands on them, but they assure us that these will surely speed up the construction of our hold. The engineers in question do seem quite eager, perhaps a little too eager..."
  diggy.11.a:0 "How could this possibly go wrong?"
  diggy.11.b:0 "What do you mean, "technically safe"?"

  diggy.12.t:0 "Restoration of [Root.GetName]"
  diggy.12.d:0 "After many years of work, [Root.GetName] has been restored to its former glory! We have faced many trials and tribulations, but surely, with the hold functioning once more, we will be able to truly build our nation up, or in this case down, towards a better tomorrow!"
  diggy.12.a:0 "Fantastic!"

  diggy.13.t:0 "Capture of [Root.GetName]"
  diggy.13.d:0 "The battle for [Root.GetName] was long and harsh, and many noble warriors died. The fierce battle that took place has severely damaged the hold, but it's nothing that cannot be repaired in the long run."
  diggy.13.a:0 "Such is the nature of war"

  diggy.15.t:0 "Ancient Treasure"
  diggy.15.d:0 "As the rock fell away, our miners saw a most wondrous sight. An ancient chamber, full to the brim with ancient Dwarven relics, dating all the way back to the time of Aul-Dwarov. But even more importantly, they seem to be made out of pure, solid gold!"
  diggy.15.a:0 "Melt them down!"
  diggy.15.b:0 "Create a Museum"
  diggy.15.c:0 "Surely this can't be it? Dig deeper!"
  diggy.15.e:0 "It may be best to leave them be..."

  diggy.16.t:0 "An Old Hold"
  diggy.16.d:0 "As the stone crumbles away, a sight is revealed to our miners unlike anything else. An entire abandoned Hold, deep underground, entirely lost to time! The idea of exploring this new hold is popular, especially amongst local adventurers, as it promises adventure, danger, glory, insight into the past, and most importantly, treasure! Some, however, warn against it, and worry of the dangers that this hold could present to our people."
  diggy.16.a:0 "For trea- I mean, for adventure!"
  diggy.16.b:0 "Perhaps it was abandoned for a reason..."



  diggy.27.t:0 "[Root.GetName] Hold Specialization"
  diggy.27.d:0 "As our hold progresses ever deeper into the earth it has come to our attention that, like in the days of Aul-Dwarov, a hold must specialize to witness its true potential. From now on, [Root.GetName] must decide to focus on a certain aspect, based on what natural resources and opportunities the hold has available.\n\nWill it focus on the infrastructure of a foundry hold, full of conveyors, tracks and great forges to out-scale any other metal production? Perhaps infrastructure to maintain an even higher population? A Metropolis? Houses stacked upon houses carved upon the walls of the Dwarovar where city and commercial business can flourish alike. Maybe a hold to focus on the finer arts? A hold beautifully crafted with elegant architecture to please and inspire our master artisans and crafters. Or might it even have the infrastructure to support vast vertical farms, so that our hold will be green with plant life to feed our people? Or perhaps the hold will lean towards military matters, with large fortifications and massive roads so as to defend ourselves against outsiders, both above and below?\n\nOnly time will tell what our hold with specialize in."
  diggy.27.a:0 "Foundry Infrastructure"
  diggy.27.b:0 "Metropolis Infrastructure"
  diggy.27.c:0 "Artisan Infrastructure"
  diggy.27.e:0 "Vertical Farm Infrastructure"
  diggy.27.f:0 "Military Infrastructure"

  diggy.31.t:0 "Successful Development"
  diggy.31.d:0 "Good news reaches us, for once! One of our holds, [Root.GetName], has successfully conducted a dig, and with this success, we step ever onward to prosperity!"
  diggy.31.a:0 "If only we could dig faster"

  diggy.32.t:0 "[Root.GetName] Under Attack!"
  diggy.32.d:0 "A vast horde of Cave Goblins have attacked [Root.GetName]! Already our defenses are being put to the test, though they will not hold forever. If we are to destroy this menace, decisive action must be taken in the defence of our hold."
  diggy.32.a:0 "Kill them all!"

  diggy.33.t:0 "[Root.GetName] is Being Ambushed!"
  diggy.33.d:0 "A vast horde of Cave Goblins have ambushed [Root.GetName]! Though we were caught off-guard, our defences are already coming through, despite some initial tactical setbacks. If we are to truly destroy this menace, however, decisive action must be taken in the defence of our hold."
  diggy.33.a:0 "Prepare our best troops!"

  diggy.34.t:0 "Infested Assault"
  diggy.34.d:0 "The squatters of an Infested Hold have launched an assault against us! Once more, we must take up arms in defence of our nation, and for our very survival."
  diggy.34.a:0 "They're coming out of the very walls!"

  diggy.35.t:0 "Cavern of Interest"

  diggy.35.ta:0 "Beautiful Cavern"
  diggy.35.u:0 "Old Dwarven Artefact"
  diggy.35.v:0 "No longer exploring"
  CavernOfInterest_1:0 "Our miners have stumbled upon one of the most beautiful sights a Dwarf can see: a cache of gold! We cannot be sure its provenance, as any inscriptions or inventory details have faded. Perhaps this is the loot of a long-deceased raiding party, or the treasury of some abandoned Hold, or even a relic of old Aul-Dwarov itself. No matter now—it will be casted down, stamped with our coinage, and put to better use."
  CavernOfInterest_2:0 "Swords. Spears. Maces. Bows, and Crossbows. And axe-heads, the sole remnant of once-mighty arms whose handles have long-since rotted away. All those and more litter the floor of the cavern. Some bear bloodstains—so caked on it is hard to distinguish from rust - while others seem nearly pristine, and some even bear decorative inlays. It is not clear exactly who left these here, or why, but we will ensure these long-idle arms have their day once more."
  CavernOfInterest_3:0 "When our miners made their way into the cavern, it seemed nondescript. But when one of them leaned against the wall, only to recoil at its frigid touch, that illusion was quickly dispelled. Every wall of this cave seems adorned in Mithril, the mineral belying its extreme rarity with its abundance in this cave. We have never seen the like, and already there are debates over whether such a phenomenon might be the aftermath of some Precursor Relic or an old technology of Aul-Dwarov. Certainly, once our extraction facilities are set up, it is likely to usher in a never-before-seen age of mithril craftsmanship in our nation."
  CavernOfInterest_4:0 "The first mining party sent into the cavern did not return. Neither did the second, nor the third. It was only with the fourth that survivors made it back to inform us of what we had discovered: a vast horde of wild orcs, laying concealed in ambush. We must avenge our fallen miners, and teach these brutes that the Dwarovar is ours—to arms!"
  CavernOfInterest_5:0 "We have stumbled on a very strange, and very old, relic in this cavern: an abandoned rail-car from the old Dwarovar network! The inscription of Er-Natvir train inspectors attests to its suitability for service, though how such a train-car got here, when there are no rails in sight, boggles the mind. While we will have to leave that mystery to the most eccentric of our historians, one thing is clear: the train must have been part of some complex trade deal, and we will happily take the assorted minerals and resources within for our own."
  CavernOfInterest_6:0 "The cavern is vast and empty, except for at its very center, where lays a small yet ornate mausoleum. We shall not disturb whomever lays within: perhaps they are some great dwarf, perhaps they are one of the few goblins who garnered such a resting place, perhaps they are someone else entirely. We shall take it merely as a reminder of all the greatness that has passed before — greatness we may claim one day in turn."
  CavernOfInterest_7:0 "Those eyes. Those damned eyes. Like torches in the dark, like blood splattered on silver. The last survivor of our expedition may never forget them, and be haunted by their memory and by whispers in the dark until the day she dies. But we have more important matters, closer to hand—like avenging every miner who fell to this ambush!"
  CavernOfInterest_8:0 "In a corner of this cavern we have come across an abandoned caravan with a design unlike any we have seen before, and we looking closer, we discovered why—this is no ordinary transporter of goods or resources, but rather one of the many carts that would carry the latest updates from Dûr-Vazhatun out to the wider world. It is said that across the Dwarovar, and indeed across all Halann, the arrival of one of these carts would upend the lives of every local philosopher and scientist. Whether Dûr-Vazhatun was disproving an old theory, elevating a new hypothesis, or remarking on a truly extraordinary discovery, every new delivery meant another step forward in our understanding of the world. And while the pages and arguments within may be centuries old, it is clear they are having something of a similar effect on our own knowledge-seekers."
  CavernOfInterest_9:0 "We have come upon a site unlike any other in the Dwarovar. This temple, if you can call it that, bears crude pictures of the Dookan etched on the cavern walls, along with an altar either rusted or bloodstained. It is clear evidence of an organized religion, and we shudder to imagine what rituals priests may have carried out in such a domain. There is one oddity, though—why does one corner of the temple bear a set of manacles, still faintly glowing with old and powerful enchantments..?"
  CavernOfInterest_10:0 "A strange scholar has long argued that mushrooms are the greatest hope for our future—or the source of our downfall, if we do not heed his words (and fund his research). Let's make sure not to alert him to our most recent discovery: a vast cavern full of mushrooms of every shape, colour, size, and taste. That said, we should make sure to bring this to the attention of our fungi farmers, because such a cavern could very well be exactly what we need to feed our growing population."
  CavernOfInterest_11:0 "In our explorations of the Dwarovar, skeletons are not an uncommon find. Nor are weapons, of all material and make. But never before have we encountered both in the sheer quantity that litter this cavern. We must have stumbled upon some ancient, massive, battlefield. The mind can scarce imagine how much blood flowed over this cavern floor, and how many fought and died with the same stalactites looming above them as we see now. We cannot even be sure exactly who fought here—dwarf bones mix with orcish mix with goblin mix with elven—and there are also those stranger still, which bear no resemblance to any creature we know. Still, every bone bears the same reminder: though it is good to die in battle, it is better still for your enemy to do so!"
  CavernOfInterest_12:0 "We've found nothing. Absolutely nothing. The cavern is empty, extremely empty, extraordinarily empty. It feels empty even with our mining party's intrusion, as if before they entered it, it was some emptiness-beyond-empty. How strange—wait, no, nothing is less strange in Dwarovar than an empty cavern. On to the next!"
  CavernOfInterest_13:0 "The cavern was—is—unexciting. Some stalagmites and stalactites, a few promising mineral seams that led nowhere. We were about to write it off as just yet another cavern in the infinite array of such that can be found in the Dwarovar, when a miner dropped her pickaxe down a hole. And never heard a sound, though she listened for minutes on end. There doesn't seem to be any practical use to such a hole, except perhaps as waste disposal, but it is a reminder to us all of just how deep the Dwarovar goes. And how deep we may go in the years to come."
  CavernOfInterest_14:0 "All who walk the Dwarovar know of Hehogrim the Diligent, legendary architect of the Holds, but it appears that even in Hehodovar he was not always working with minds quite his equal. Or such is the only conclusion we can draw from the discovery of his 'Digging for Dummies', yellowed pages wrapped in beaten leather tucked behind a boulder in the corner of a cavern. It seems a comprehensive guide to the architecture, engineering, and artisanry necessary to dig out and expand high-quality holds. It will surely be of great use as we deepen our nation—now if only we could decipher what he is talking about towards the end, when he reverses his direction of inquiry entirely and starts rambling about ascension..."
  CavernOfInterest_15:0 "Most commanders would describe battle as an art, a dance of move and counter-move, each side vying for the lethal upper hand. But it seems one scholar in Haraz Orldhûm thought instead to prove it a science, or at least we assume such from the discovery of a thick tome entitled 'Killing Orcs: An Introduction' in a corner of the cavern. It seems to outline every conceivable combination of terrain, soldiers, weaponry, and strategic aim, and provide the single ideal tactical path forward. We will have to have our generals study it, to see whether the nameless scholar succeeded in his goal—or if such outlandish ideas are part of what lead Aul-Dwarov to fall in the first place."
  CavernOfInterest_16:0 "Everyone who explores the Dwarovar has their own reason for doing so. Some seek relics of the past, while others seek future glory. Some seek vengeance, imagined or otherwise, while others seem to cast about for their own absolution. But the most common, and indeed perhaps the true aim of many who profess another, is wealth—and face to face with the enormous cache of gold we discovered in this cavern, one can see why it appeals!"
  CavernOfInterest_17:0 "It all just... crumbled away. The floor of the cavern, which dropped out below the exploratory team just as they were finishing setting up their equipment. The hope of the few miners who saw it happen, who felt fingers brush their own as their friends and colleagues plummeted to their doom. And perhaps some of the confidence of our nation, as we faced this grim reminder that in the Dwarovar, every step can be your last."
  CavernOfInterest_18:0 "Skulls are common in the Dwarovar. But skulls such as the one we discovered in this cavern, adorned in gold and silver, with rubies inlaid as teeth and sapphires as eyes, are not. Why an orc's head was preserved this way is far beyond our comprehension—perhaps a ritual forgotten now even by the most learned of shamans. Such a relic will make an excellent discussion piece for the audience room of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], and it's not like the gems can shift as if watching you... Can they?"
  CavernOfInterest_19:0 "The Dwarovar is not an easy place to make our fortunes in, nor to make our futures in. It is blood and steel and darkness and peril, a fiend that seems to push you one step upward for every one you descend. It is enough to make one despondent—which is why it is important to appreciate caverns like the one we discovered, where a simple yet serene beauty reminds us of just what we fight for."
  CavernOfInterest_20:0 "In the cavern, there was an alcove. In the alcove, there was a shadow. In the shadow, there was a box. And in the box, there was a book.\n\nIn faded runes, it bears what must be in the sigil of Hehodovar. And inside, is enough information to make a man go mad... with ambition, for what we might forge the Dwarovar into."
  CavernOfInterest_21:0 "We have had to call off the exploration of our caverns."


  diggy.36.t:0 "Rail in [Root.GetName] Restored!"
  diggy.36.d:0 "For the first time in millennia, wheels shift upon metal track, as a section of the ancient Dwarovar rail system has been restored. It has taken great effort, but now, surely, the vast flow of people, goods, and armies, will make all of the effort worth it."

And they bring incredible news with them: At the bottom of the lake is the corpse of a huge Snake-like creature, unknown to the world. But as wizards and scholars moved about in every direction to find out its nature, a huge earthquake ripped through the cavern, dropping huge stalactites into the lake and shattering the cave structure!"
  diggy.39.d.2:0 "While a few people were beginning their explorations of the cavern, a huge earthquake tore out the ceiling of the cave, causing a rockfall and completely burying the cave."

They are a small group of about a thousand Granite Dwarves, whose clans lived in this hold for millennia. If they are to be believed, they have been hiding in the deepest parts of the hold for at least a century now, using guerilla tactics to fight off goblin search parties and other predators. Their leader goes by 'Goblinsbane', and has apparently killed over ten thousand goblins himself. The discovery of such a great and ancient hero prompted the entire hold to break out into celebration!

In every Hold, a second flag rose to adorn proud walls, to match the great banner of Aul-Dwarov already flapping in the wind.\n\nEvery one of these flags had its own history, its own triumphs and failures. In recent centuries, it is the failures that loomed large. But now, as they unite once more, all Halann remembers the way they stood strong against the Ancient Precursor Empire, the way they invented techniques and mechanisms still beyond our comprehension.

For today, they will be discussing the one issue most near and dear to Dwarven hearts, and the bedrock of their most bitter disputes — coin.\n\nIt is time for Aul-Dwarov to decide its budgetary priority for the years to come. Some argue for a policy of economic expansion, devoting every week to come to the construction of new infrastructure, from the homes that house our people to the temples they pray in to the warehouses that store almost every good found in Halann. Others would instead focus on efficiency, ensuring that our assembly lines are operating at full capacity and minimizing waste products, to boost our output like never before. Some Holds, especially those in strategic positions along the Dwarven Rail, would have us focus not on the production of goods but their free flow throughout the Empire — they remind us that blood must be pumped through a body if it is to live. A fourth group turns their eyes not inward but outwards, and decries the way that Serpentspine gems and minerals flow across Halann as a looting of our realm, that must immediately be stopped.\n\nThe Amlharaz grants each Hold a vote — but at the day's end, it shall speak in a single voice.

Today, the Amlharaz shall be discussing the Dwarven army.\n\nEach Hold has their own specialization when it comes to war, and in turn, each would see a different focus for Aul-Dwarov's forces. Some delegates hearken to the Greentide past, and would have our army grow to a size where it could match the Goblin and Orcish hordes. Others would pursue a policy of refurbishing the army's guns and improving its armour, which they promise shall forge our soldiers into a wall as unbreakable as those of any Hold. That argument almost leads to blows, however, as it faces vehement opposition from those that insist the age of basic soldiery must give way to an age of artillery.

His voice is quickly drowned out, however, by a faction who believes the bureaucracy must be expanded to properly administrate the growing Empire (and they note they have already drawn up the forms to do so). Opposing them in turn are the representative of Holds who would have our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] instead listen to those Dwarves of exceeding brilliance and skill, and grant them the authority to cut through seas of paperwork as they deem necessary to ensure the proper functioning of the Empire.

This is all that is known about Ovdal Asra, though, for it fell a long time ago, and has not been rediscovered (except for a brief moment in 1410, by Fognir Asra). It lives on, however, in the form of the Agate of Asra, which sat in the vaults of the Asra Bank until recently, when it was conveyed home to the Serpentspine. And now it belongs to us!"
  diggy.217.a:0 "This will make a fine addition to our collection!"

  diggy.218.t:0 "The Dwarovkron"
  diggy.218.d:0 "Through a mix of both fair means and foul, we have managed to obtain a relic from ages long gone by! The Dwarovkron was an ancient crown which sat upon the brow of the High King of Aul-Dwarov to represent the unification of all dwarfkind under one throne and one Assembly. It was lost during the last days of the Dwarovar, but has now been found - and reassembled! (Though not necessarily by us.) It matters not how we obtained it, only that we did, and with such an artifact in our possession, our dominance over the Serpentspine will surely be uncontested."

  diggy.500.t:0 "Gas Explosion"
  diggy.500.d:0 "A spark. A single damned spark. That was all that it took for the gas pocket to ignite, and our entire shaft to explode. The tunnel has since collapsed, and our miners have, unfortunately, died, as there was nowhere near enough warning for them to evacuate."
  diggy.500.a:0 "Damn it!"

  diggy.501.t:0 "Cave Collapse!"
  diggy.501.d:0 "A single loose beam was all that it took for our mineshaft to come crashing down, with scores of miners buried alive underneath vast tonnes of rock. Our mining efforts have been set back, and their families have been informed of the loss. Though tragic, this will surely be only one accident amongst many in the name of our hold's progress."

  diggy.503.t:0 "Blood and Sweat"
  diggy.503.d:0 "Our miners have come across rock that, itself, breaks all but the strongest of mining equipment. And yet, our determined brethren continue. Through pain, they mine. Through sweat, they mine. Through sheer force of will, they mine."

  diggy.504.t:0 "Two Miners, One Magical Mineral"
  diggy.504.d:0 "Word has reached us of a great discovery! In one of the many tunnels that snake their way through our hold, two miners have come across a vast deposit of the magical mineral, damestear — a main ingredient in all things magic from artificery to enchantments. Up until this point they have been speaking almost in unison, but soon, the two begin bickering. Eventually, the first miner speaks, and says that the damestear must be mined and exploited for the benefit of our great nation, and would surely bring great riches. The second, however, raises her voice, and loudly proclaims that mining damestear would, rather than riches, bring great danger, and not be worth the risk to extract."

  diggy.505.t:0 "Damestear Explosion"

  diggy.506.t:0 "Goblin Ambush"
  diggy.506.d:0 "Miners enter a cavern. Beyond the light of their torches, there is only darkness. They tread carefully, wary of disturbing any traps that may be lying there. The cavern is silent, but for the soft crackling of their torches. Then—arrows fly. The torches clatter to the ground, and are snuffed upon the cold stone floor. For a few seconds, there is naught but darkness. And then, in an instant, the darkness is pierced by the glow of hundreds of glowing yellow eyes."

  diggy.508.t:0 "Beautiful Cavern"
  diggy.508.d:0 "Upon first inspection, the cavern appears to be like any other, a small opening within the mountain, filled with air rather than earth. But only upon first inspection. For once you enter the cavern, its truly wondrous properties become apparent. The walls seem to be entirely encrusted with crystals! When light is shone upon them, they reflect light in such a way as to create a complete tapestry of light, winding, twirling, and shifting as the light sources move. This may be the closest that we ever get to true beauty."
  diggy.508.a:0 "How much do you think those crystals are worth?"
  diggy.508.b:0 "Open the cavern to all! For a price, of course..."

  diggy.509.t:0 "Beautiful Cavern Profits"
  diggy.509.d:0 "Across our hold, people flock to see the wondrous cavern we have discovered! Commoners and elites alike are left dumbstruck by the beauty of the changing and shifting patterns of the lights. It has inspired many pieces in our hold's more artistic community, but even the artists themselves agree that they cannot truly recapture the beauty of the cavern itself."

  diggy.510.d:0 "The stone seems to split and crack, as an entire section of our hold, brand new, sinks deep into the mountain. Upon investigation, it appears that the specific structures were built upon an underground river, and with enough construction and erosion, the stone simply could not hold. Fortunately, those who were present at the time were able to be rescued, and although there were many injuries, there were thankfully no deaths."

  diggy.511.t:0 "Serpentsmite"
  diggy.511.d:0 "Is this the end? The mountains themselves seem to roar with rage, as an earthquake unlike any seen in living memory shakes our hold to its very core. Great cracks form in the rock, swallowing buildings whole, and rubble falls from above, shattering structures and burying citizens alive. For a full hour, the quake continues, reaping ever more damage as the seconds go by. And then, just as suddenly as it began, it ceases. The damage is immense, and many of our resources are taken up simply keeping our hold in one piece. Now, however, a choice lies before us; this great quake, which split open the core of our hold, has revealed many precious minerals that were previously undiscovered. Due to the unstable nature of the fissures, access to these minerals will likely be short-lived. We could devote effort to harvesting these resources, but this would surely take away from the efforts to rescue and treat survivors."

These have forced us to reroute the excavations and change the schematics to accommodate these unanticipated barriers. However, they may also present an opportunity. With some clever engineering, we could tap into them to provide heat and power for the new level's dwellings and industries."

  diggy.554.d:0 "The Dwarovrod in [event_province.GetName] is in serious need of repair after several sections were damaged: a cave-in buried a set of switches and signals, a band of feral bugbears ripped up rails to smelt into weapons, and a small spur line has been nearly obliterated by a lava flow. Trains carrying cargo and passengers are backed up for miles, as they take turns using one track for both directions. Repairing the track will be expensive, but not doing so will cost even more in the long term."
  diggy.554.a:0 "Fix the rails as expressly as possible"
  diggy.554.b:0 "Unfortunately, repairs must be delayed"

  diggy.555.t:0 "Wandering Ettins"

Both savage and stupid, they are almost always solitary creatures. However, a shortage of prey has led to a group of hungry ettins in [event_province.GetName] to band together. Now they are wreaking havoc on our settlements there, eating our subjects with glee. We will need to send a cohort of soldiers and adventurers to deal with them - but such a force will not be cheap."
  diggy.555.a:0 "Pack two guns, one for each head."
  diggy.555.b:0 "The settlers are on their own."

  diggy.556.t:0 "Antique Machine"
  diggy.556.d:0 "One of the best tinkerers in [Root.Capital.GetName] has brought us marvelous news. Through hard work, gumption, and a spark of genius, she has managed to restore an ancient dwarven machine to functioning. Inlaid with a beautiful latticework of mithril and brass, studded with gems faintly glowing with arcane energy, whirring with gears and bearings still as precise as the day they were crafted - yet we still have no earthly idea what it does and why it was built. Undoubtedly it would fetch a princely sum from a wealthy collector, but we may also discern some valuable knowledge if we choose to study the device."

  diggy.556.b:0 "Study it"

  diggy.557.t:0 "Halanna's Breath"
  diggy.557.d:0 "Farmers in [province.GetName] have reported a marvelous finding. Seeking new caverns to sow, they stumbled upon a dormant, cooled caldera, hosting remarkable, almost supernatural botany. Mushrooms the size of trees sprout up from the ground and hang down from the roof like stalactites. Serpentbloom wraps like vines around the stalks and caps, glowing so strongly that the cavern is lit with a dawn-like twilight. The farmers estimate that this single lush cavern could provide as much food as a dozen cultivated ones."

  diggy.558.d:0 "Before the townspeople of [event_province.GetName] know what's upon them, dozens eight-legged monstrosities clamber up the walls and cut the guards in two with razor-sharp pincers. Soon, the citizens are wrapped up in impenetrable webs, drained of their vital fluids, their dried husks hosts to clutches of spider eggs. We can clear the nest with torch and blade, but the damage has been done."
  diggy.558.d2:0 "A guard's keen ears luckily pick up the faint tremors of hundreds of arachnid legs skittering towards a township in [event_province.GetName]. Given enough warning, the townspeople take up positions with torches, whips, nets, and prods. Soon a massive herd of giant spiders comes stampeding toward the settlement and into the improvised corral. With luck and skill, we will tame these beasts, harvest their silk, and terrorize our enemies riding on their backs."

  diggy.559.d:0 "A puny bunch of orcs have come to our camp in [event_province.GetName]. Their chief says he and his tribe want the loot and glory that comes with being part of [Root.GetName]. The [Root.GovernmentName] always needs more warriors, but we should make these runts carry our water and chop our wood before putting them on our front lines."

  diggy.560.t:0 "Tribal Wars"
  diggy.560.d:0 "A caravan of settlers in [province.GetName] has stumbled upon a grisly sight. Local orcs and goblins, skewered, dismembered, beheaded - an apparent mutual massacre. A little further down the road, they encounter the abandoned camps of the natives, the survivors having evidently fled the area. Despite their primitive status, their corpses and camps are ripe for looting. Additionally, their absence will make settling [event_province.GetName] all the easier."
  diggy.560.a:0 "Splendid!"

  diggy.561.t:0 "Treasure Trove"
  diggy.561.d:0 "A rockslide in a cave has uncovered a sprawling mine complex, possibly hundreds of years old. Although the mine itself seems to have long since been completely emptied of anything worth digging up, during our explorations we came across a massive hoard of jewellery and coinage presumably left here for safe keeping before the entrance was buried."
  diggy.561.a:0 "The mines relinquish one last haul..."

  diggy.562.t:0 "Ancient War Golem"
  diggy.562.d:0 "While digging, our miners uncovered what they believed to be a large mithril statue, but further inspection and excavation has revealed something very different; It's a dormant War Golem, buried for over a thousand years!"
  diggy.562.a:0 "It will serve us on the battlefield, as it was meant to."
  diggy.562.b:0 "Made of mithril, you say..."
  diggy.562.c:0 "It's too precious! It belongs in a museum."

  diggy.563.t:0 "Ancestral Statue"
  diggy.563.d:0 "We have discovered a small, mostly-buried shrine, possibly dating back to before the last days of the Dwarovar. It contains only one thing: An intricately carved and vibrantly painted statue of an unknown Dwarf. Although it bears no inscription, the significance is clear; this was once an object of great veneration."
  diggy.563.a:0 "Smash it. These lands are ours now."
  diggy.563.b:0 "This was a place of veneration, and so it shall be once more."

This armory will equip our armies well for many wars to come."

  diggy.566.t:0 "Bat Flu"
  diggy.566.d:0 "A strange wasting illness among the townsfolk in [event_province.GetName] has left many dying in droves with dry coughs and rattling breaths. From what we can tell, this sickness can be traced back to the province's massive population of cave bats. Our mages claim to have developed an elixir that, when sprayed into the caverns, will cause the loathsome creatures to shrivel up and blow away like dust. Our more pragmatic advisors suggest we use those resources to help to the sick and dying."

  diggy.567.d:0 "Out of the dark corners and caverns of [event_province.GetName] they come: bugbears, with matted fur and frenzy in their eyes, attacking all in their path. Already several outlying settlements have been put to the torch and the colonists have been carried off. As luck would have it, one of the prisoners has escaped and tells us she can lead us back to the bugbears' hideout. We could send a company of soldiers to dispatch them and free the colonists. On the other hand, bugbears attack indiscriminately - by bribing and cajoling the leaders of the band, they may leave our [Root.Culture.GetGroupName] settlers alone and turn their savage axes on the natives of [event_province.GetName]."

A massive barricade of mining carts, bulky freight cars, and sleek engines lies in the middle of the track, studded with makeshift turrets. Strewn about are a motley array of rusting weapons and armor, and skeletons of dwarves, orcs, and goblins. Whoever built the barricade lost their battle long ago, but their works remain an obstacle to our colony's development. We could direct the colonists to stall other projects to dismantle the barricade, or to work around the barricade, leaving the wreckage for another day."

We must admit, ours are not nearly as well-built. In [event_province.GetName], our miners complain of unbearable heat and foul air. The wood of the trusses supporting the shafts rots, and the screws rust away. To ensure full productivity, we must invest in repairing and maintaining the mines - or even copy the designs of the ancient dwarves and improve them. However, this would be a capital-intensive effort."

In fact the remains of a battlefield, it is littered with countless squat skeletons of dwarves and tusked skulls of orcs. From what we can piece together, there was no clear victor - both sides seem to have lost the battle. The survivors were clearly too few or too exhausted to loot the corpses, which are now ripe for plunder."

  diggy.572.d2:0 ""No, you dimwit!" shouted an old dwarf, stepping forward from the crowd. "That's not how you pronounce that name!" Two guards quickly jumped the old greybeard, muzzling him as they dragged him out of the hall. The damage was already done, however, and doubtful murmurs filled the room. Did the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] really not know how to interpret the old runes? They seemed so simple.

The generations of conflict between Dwarves, Goblins, and Orcs have created a broad and general distrust, an assumption that the Other desires nothing more than to kill and take what little each people have. Whispered tales of atrocities and glorious revenge are told in hushed voices to children at night, to make them fear the boogymen and raise them to rejoice in their ancient enemy's destruction. So the distrust between peoples is reinforced and compounded, each side believing the worst of their foes, ensuring that conflict will continue to rage whenever orcs, goblins, and dwarves come into contact with each other.\n\nIn the province of [event_province.GetName], this atmosphere of xenophobia and paranoia has boiled over into open conflict between the peoples that live there. It is uncertain how the conflict started, but it quickly escalated into mob violence, with armed gangs patrolling the streets, breaking into homes, looting shops, and killing any members of other races they laid their hands on. After a gory night of fire and blood, the grip of murderous insanity began to release the mob, and the survivors could begin to take stock of the aftermath - Houses burned, livelihoods destroyed, countless dead and even more displaced.

Such is the case that this appears to be occurring in [event_province.GetName], where local businesses have conspired to force minorities out of businesses where they have otherwise been profitable. Their tactics have included undercutting prices, leveraging municipal councils to implement unfavorable policies for their competitors, and vandalism of minority-controlled properties. While some degree of hostile competition is expected, these actions have gone far beyond simply business hostility and are targeting individuals who would otherwise be profitable businessfolk. If we step in to stop these actions it will certainly be unpopular, but we will likely strengthen the local economy by doing so."
  diggy.752.a:0 "Don't risk riling up the people - if they force the minorities out, so be it."
  diggy.752.b:0 "The businesses are going to accept some competition, by force it seems."

  diggy.753.t:0 "A Rejection of Kind"
  diggy.753.d:0 "A wealthy dwarven majority district in [event_province.getname] has recently seen an influx of orcs and goblins of means, who have used their wealth to acquire property and take up residence in the area. They have made this move despite the overwhelming dwarven population of the district being unwelcoming to them, intent on shouldering into territories that would deny them simply on the basis of the circumstance of birth, insistent on acquiring good opportunities for their children and showing that they are more than capable of living side by side in peace. While there are no rules that explicitly forbid orcs and goblins from living in the district, the populace is up in arms over this move. A group of influential business owners and local magnates have petitioned the government to force the minorities out of the district, though there is no legal standing to do so. They will certainly be upset and cause problems if we do not, however."
  diggy.753.a:0 "Move them out - they're causing a ruckus."
  diggy.753.b:0 "They have every right to live where they choose."

  diggy.754.t:0 "Those who Work Forces"
  diggy.754.d:0 "As important as state and family are for dwarven society, business is in many ways the heart of day-to-day civilization among the dwarves. Businesses are organized as associations of similar enterprises, often through related families, known as Cartels, and are responsible for not only private sector work but also various subcontracted governmental assignments, such as public security. As more land has been reclaimed in the Dwarovar and the number of outlying settlements and districts grows, the role of these private police forces becomes ever more important in keeping the peace. Unfortunately, there has recently been a string of problematic policing activities that has revealed major biases in the cartel police forces - they have refused to intervene in protecting minorities, failed to press legal charges against connected individuals, and have even been accused of perpetrating violent acts against individuals that some consider “undesirable” - goblins and orcs living in the districts they patrol. There is a general feeling that public security is being undermined by the cartel security forces, and some have asked us to step in more directly to ensure better trained and more morally upstanding police are in place."
  diggy.754.a:0 "Who are we to interfere in the function of private business?"
  diggy.754.b:0 "The cartels listen to money. Pay them to ensure all receive protection."

  diggy.755.t:0 "Ancestral Claims"
  diggy.755.d:0 "The reclamation of the Dwarovar by the dwarves has been a goal for thousands of years, but it was nothing more than a remote dream until the Greentide brought the overwhelming majority of the orcs and goblins out of the mountains. Into the power vacuum left behind flowed the reclaimers - remnant holds and adventurers from the surface alike struck out to retake their ancestral halls. But for all the dwarven claims to rightful ownership, the goblins and orcs have inhabited the roads and holds of the mountains in the dwarves' absence, and have no lack of a claim to homeland. As such, conflicting claims over various pieces of land has been a constant crisis since the reclamation of the Dwarovar.\n\nNow, in [event_province.GetName], such claims are threatening to boil over into open conflict. Two different clans are asserting that they are the rightful owners of valuable land, rich in minerals and containing many old structures that date to the time of Aul Dwarov. Both are refusing to yield in their rights of property and have brought dozens of pieces of documentation and oral testimony to the courts to back their claims. As the court case rages, tensions rise and the risk of angry words turning into blows rises. Knowing the matter to be sensitive, the courts have turned to the central government and ask us to resolve the matter, as they do not seem to have a ready answer to the question."
  diggy.755.a:0 "We're not getting involved in this - if they fight, they fight."
  diggy.755.b:0 "Very well - but settling this will be a drain on government resources…"

  diggy.756.t:0 "Minority Districts"
  diggy.756.d:0 "In the province of [event_province.GetName], there has recently been an dramatic increase in racial segregation. A combination of deliberate city planning measures by our administrators and unwelcoming attitudes from the population have forced the region's minorities into rundown neighborhoods that are overpopulated and unsanitary. The suffering in these ghettos, consigned to the remote corners of the hold, is immense, but it is also easy to miss - sticking to the prosperous parts of the city, one might never know that there are such terrible areas in the town. We could ensure that infrastructure extends to those neighborhoods and force changes in some of these more xenophobic administrators, but such an operation would surely be unpopular."
  diggy.756.a:0 "That really doesn't sound like much of an issue."
  diggy.756.b:0 "Well that can't be allowed to stand. Let's try to fix some of this."

  diggy.757.t:0 "Mining Accident"
  diggy.757.d:0 "A terrible accident has recently befallen one of our mining operations in [event_province.GetName] - a shaft that was believed to have been secure has collapsed and buried many miners alive. Most died immediately, while others were left to languish in the dark until they were rescued. In the aftermath of this great loss of life, the mine overseers have conducted an investigation of the likely causes and have produced a report that blames the inferior workmanship of the minority populations as the cause! Citing their many failings in intelligence, workmanship, and materials manufacturing, they have laid the blame squarely at the feet of the minorities. This has inflamed the emotions of the families and friends of the deceased miners, and has led to the mass-firings of many in mining and unrelated jobs around the province. Some of our advisors have suggested that we should likely review the report and accident site to double check the accusations of the foreman, but that would be expensive and potentially upset relations with the mining cartel."
  diggy.757.a:0 "The Cartel must have the right of it - it's the minority's fault!"
  diggy.757.b:0 "We'll give this a look over and ensure that it doesn't happen again"

  diggy.758.t:0 "The Prejudices of Rulers"
  diggy.758.d:0 "The memories of dwarves are long, the names of ancestors from 40 generations ago remembered in prayer and the loves and hatreds of their people felt longer. Among the noble houses and wealthy elites of dwarven society, who still keep relics from the time of Aul Dwarov, there is a deep-seated feeling that the whole of the Serpentspine is the rightful possession of the dwarves, that their ancestral and rightful homeland must be retaken, and that no compromise can be offered to any lesser claimants, either dwarves of other clans or the goblins and orcs that still dwell in the darkness of the Dwarovar.\n\nAs we have expanded and reclaimed more territory, ever more goblins and orcs have come to dwell within our territory. While the majority live at the fringes, many have found their way into our towns and cities, where they work as a permanent underclass. Distrusted at best by the population, there have recently been rumblings that some of the workers have reached a camaraderie with these minority populations, feeling more in common with their fellow laborers than with the wealthy, and that they have begun to argue for extending certain rights and privileges to the orc and goblin populations. As word of this has reached the elites it has provoked furor - have these foolish laborers forgotten of the glory of their ancestors, and who it was that stole the ancient empire? A group of wealthy and influential nobles have come to the government and demand that we come down hard on any troublemakers and on the minority districts as a whole, putting those repugnant creatures in their place and ensuring that our state will not go the way of Aul Dwarov."
  diggy.758.a:0 "Long are our memories as well. We will brook no tolerance to these squatters."
  diggy.758.b:0 "And how did such things aid Aul Dwarov? We must carve a new path."

  serpent_rot.1.a:0 "They all fall down..."

  serpent_rot.4.d:0 "The disease which has been ravaging the Dwarovar continues to take victims as it slowly rots away our people. Casualties skyrocket, and we are hard-pressed to care for the sick, not to mention to dispose of the piles of corpses we find ourselves burdened with."

  serpent_rot.8.a:0 "We know the source, now we must find the cure"

  serpent_rot.9.t:0 "It's in their Blood"
  serpent_rot.9.d:0 "After several investigations, it would seem that this plague causes the blood of the victims to literally rot from within, assaulting the host's internal organs, causing itching, suffocation, vomiting, bloody diarrhea, before killing its victim, drowned in their own rotten blood."
  serpent_rot.9.a:0 "The more we understand, the closer the cure"

  serpent_rot.12.t:0 "The Evil Grows"
  serpent_rot.12.d:0 "After multiple tests, we now know that the Serpent's Rot is spread through the air, and is highly sensitive to heat and therefore fire. The most pessimistic of our researchers, however, think that it is already far too late to contain the disease, and that nothing short of the appearance of a healthy carrier could save us."

  serpent_rot.16.d:0 "We have succeeded! An effective remedy can finally be deployed, and allow us to eradicate once and for all this ancient horror. May our [Root.GetAdjective] researchers be blessed!\n\nIt is said that all the holds and roads of the Dwarovar are linked with an extensive ventilation system, and distributing through this if necessary will be the most impactful."

  serpent_rot.16.b:0 "Spread it through the ventilation system!"

  serpent_rot.17.t:0 "What Must Be Done"

  serpent_rot.20.a:0 "What have we done..."

  serpent_rot.21.t:0 "Healthy Carrier"
  serpent_rot.21.d:0 "Against all odds, a healthy carrier seems to have appeared! His entire family had succumbed to the disease, but he is the only one to have survived! How shall we proceed?"

  serpent_rot.21.b:0 "There is no time, Mycos Caurak must burn!"

  serpent_rot.22.t:0 "The Explosion of Mycos Caurak"
  serpent_rot.22.d:0 "As soon as the flames began to spread through the narrow passages of the collapsed path of the cavern, a huge gas explosion followed, killing our entire team on the spot, and making the cavern forever inaccessible."
  serpent_rot.22.a:0 "A small price to pay for salvation"

  serpent_rot.23.t:0 "The Healthy Carrier"
  serpent_rot.23.d:0 "After examining the body of the healthy carrier, without finding anything abnormal at home, he confessed to us his consumption in large quantities of a particular mushroom, known as Pristine Fungi.\n\nAlthough this mushroom is renowned as disgusting, it seems to be the only thing that all survivors have common, having had to consume the mushroom in order to survive after losing their livelihoods to the Rot."
  serpent_rot.23.a:0 "Run further experiments"
  serpent_rot.23.b:0 "Collect samples of the Fungi"
  serpent_rot.23.c:0 "This is a trap; burn the mushrooms!"

  serpent_rot.24.t:0 "What Kind of Spell?"

  serpent_rot.24.c:0 "Evocation"

  serpent_rot.25.t:0 "It looks like Necromancy"

  serpent_rot.26.a:0 "Seal the damned place."

  serpent_rot.27.t:0 "Efforts Wasted"
  serpent_rot.27.d:0 "It seems that the Rot is not magical, but rather a natural disease. Our people are in uproar, and we must find solutions quickly. There is no more time to waste."

  serpent_rot.29.b:0 "We don't have the funds to spare"

  serpent_rot.30.t:0 "Sacrificial Breakthrough"
  serpent_rot.30.d:0 "After several months of hard research, one of our most dedicated researchers seemed to have found a way to at least slow the Serpent's Rot. Unfortunately in the course of his research, he deliberately infected himself with the Rot in order to view the results of his work, and though he could slow the disease, he could not halt it. Worse, besides the loss of one of our best minds, he was not able to properly explain his research before his untimely demise. His peers are already trying to decipher his notes."
  serpent_rot.30.a:0 "His sacrifice will not be in vain"

  serpent_rot.31.t:0 "Fighting the Rot"
  serpent_rot.31.d:0 "Our researchers seem to have found a way to slow the progression of the virus among the infected, even seeming to stop it completely in some cases. It's a big step towards finding true definitive cure!"
  serpent_rot.31.a:0 "We slowly inch closer"

  serpent_rot.32.t:0 "Population Demands more Funding"
  serpent_rot.32.d:0 "Several petitioners representing the common people, despite the monumental resources we have already committed, demand that more effort be used in fighting the Serpent's rot. Though we have made it clear how much has already been put in place, they are adamant that more must be done."
  serpent_rot.32.a:0 "We will. Let us invest even more."
  serpent_rot.32.b:0 "Not fast enough they say? Use them as test subjects!"
  serpent_rot.32.c:0 "We are already doing all we can"

  serpent_rot.33.t:0 "Finance Research"
  serpent_rot.33.d:0 "The elite of our nation urge us to further fund the research effort, and to send more and more money to our magicians and researchers working hard to find a cure. How shall we respond?"
  serpent_rot.33.a:0 "Meet their demands, and more!"
  serpent_rot.33.b:0 "Do as they ask"
  serpent_rot.33.c:0 "We must preserve what funds we have"

  hoardcurse.90.t:0 "Reclaiming our Glory"
  hoardcurse.90.d:0 "As [Root.Monarch.GetName] leaves to walk the streets of [Root.Capital.GetName] today, taking a discreet inspection with [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] retainers, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] thinks briefly to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] ancestors -- how proud they would be to see the Hold flourishing once more!\n\nGoods come from within and without the hold's depths, invigorating its many layers with the haggling of merchants. Rowdy taverns are bright and boisterous, filled with drunken dwarves either boasting of their ancestors' feats, or snoring dwarves who have drunken themselves silly in delight.\n\nOn to the industrial sectors, where other senses take precedence over sight. The sizzle of water upon tempered steel, the clang of hammer on metal and wood, ringing across the hold as various guilds reestablish themselves. The scalding heat of the countless ravenous furnaces fed by the bellows only makes the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] smile. The sound of the hammers and bellows seem to resonate within [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] heart, as the hold's wonder must do for every dwarf that lives within.\n\nAs the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] heads to return home after this fruitful day, one sight mars the visit's ending: homeless dwarves, thin and weak from malnourishment, something that hearkens back to more tragic days. [Root.Monarch.GetHerHisCap] retainers trace [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] eyes and quickly note that it is inevitable for there to be dregs even in such prosperous times as the present. Even during the most glorious times of the dwarves at the height of Aul-Dwarov, there were still poor people and slums, after all!\n\nWith a hesitant nod and lingering gaze, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] moves on, attempting to remove these thoughts to focus on the pressing matters at hand. The fate of few deviants in society pale in comparison to reclaiming their homeland and riches of their ancestor. The enemy is out there, in here there is naught but joy, wonder and magnificence!"

Gold, gold, gold!\n\nThe glorious, gleaming, glowing yellow metal graces even the most downtrodden of hands, as the great celebrations are held to our traders return, and they flaunt their newly found wealth with great aplomb, happily showering our people with gilded coins. A new age, a Golden Age, descends upon our nation!"
  hoardcurse.91.a:0 "Gold, gold, gold!"

  hoardcurse.92.t:0 "An Odd Predicament"
  hoardcurse.92.d:0 "More and more trade flows into our nation, and with it comes outsider dwarves to swell our numbers. Our farms are bountiful, our breweries full, and our mines at their peak.\n\nAnd yet, our nation shows signs of struggle. Banditry has forced our traders into dour moods, and the rapid increase of guards has dampened the once celebrated return, and their gold is no longer bandied about in celebration, remaining in the traders' hands. Guild leaders have begun collaborating with production owners to line their pockets, leaving the workers voiceless. Prices are steadily rising, and all the while our people seem more and more reluctant to part with their precious coins, even at the cost of their health."
  hoardcurse.92.a:0 "Mine more gold, and that will smooth things over!"

  hoardcurse.93.t:0 "A Breaking Point"
  hoardcurse.93.d:0 "Gold, gold, gold! Thoughts of gold seem to be the only thoughts left in our holds! Dwarves work themselves to bone just for a few measly coins, and even then, production numbers are down across the board as some sit in their homes and cuddle bars of gold all day!\n\nMany of these bars are loans, and the banks are skyrocketing interest prices, and backing them up with thugs from local mob bosses. Food and goods are becoming scarce as all are loaded onto the trade carts. Our people are starving and desperate, as mountains of our most precious metal fill vaults across the nation. Even the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is struggling to focus on the nation over investments, as more and more demand a solution. How to even begin addressing these myriad and inter-locking issues boggles the mind of [Root.Monarch.GetName]..."

Yet, all this is meaningless if the Link to our Holy Father cannot be maintained, for without Him, we are forsaken.\n\nThe mighty Runelink stretches from the deepest depths dwarf has yet delved to the base of [province.GetName], maintained through the Blessed Will of the Father. Yet alone it is not enough. Thus, it shall be reinforced. \n\nA great pit dug into the earth, surrounding the Runelink's entry, more than a hundred meters wide, maintained through some of the greatest runes of power yet seen by Dwarvern eyes. Mighty metal bridges, forged of mithril and reinforced through the Father's runic will, stretch across the Runelink's opening, with mighty runic winches attached to them that haul uncounted tons of material between the surface and the Deep on a daily basis. From above, the metal bridges jutting across the Runelink at irregular angles, combined with the Link's circular shape, make it resemble a mighty maw, swallowing all that it can, and belching goods in exchange. Thus, it is named the Runemaw. Such is the Will of the Father.\n\nFrom below, fresh soldiers eager to fight in His name, raw materials, and the most powerful runescribes the Father can provide. From above, uncountable slaves, fresh from our conquests, swallowed whole by the Runemaw. Do not pity the slaves, for they are gifted with divine purpose; to redeem themselves in Father's eyes, through the sweat of their brow and the blood of their veins.\n\nThus, the Runelink shall be maintained.\n\nThus, the Runelink must be maintained.\n\nIn the name of Blood, in the name of the mighty Rune.\n"

  I22_nation_desc:0 "Grônstunad, meaning the Jade Mine, served as the capital of the eastern jade dwarves, and was said to have rivaled Amldihr itself.

All good things must come to an end, however, and though for many years Grônstunad enjoyed its position in the world, everything changed when the hobgoblins attacked..."

  I24_nation_desc:0 "Aul-Dwarov. The Empire of the Dwarves. Literally known as All-Dwarves Home. Once the bastion of the ancient world, way before any sort of human or elf had any sort of urgency or glory. It fell due to dwarven infighting and the repulsive scourge that is orckind; now the Dwarovar lays in darkness in ruin.

  H79_nation_desc:0 "Known as Cannonhold, Ovdal Kanzad was the principal firearm and cannon manufacturer in Aul-Dwarov, fashioning weapons of mass destruction before the first man had learned to wield a sword. Its inhabitants are known as Amber dwarves due to their proximity to the Tree of Stone, but in fact gain their yellowish tinge from the sulfur used in such weaponry.

  F47_nation_title:0 "Resurrect Verkal Gulan"
  F47_nation_desc:0 "The hold of Verkal Gulan, along with Seghdihr itself, were the only two survivors of the fall of the Segbandal alliance after it was dissolved when Jexis conquered Seghdihr in 1139. Despite Verkal Gulan's survival and immense wealth, in isolation its people became complacent and corrupt. Its eventual fall was no surprise. Now the hold has been reclaimed by dwarves pure of heart.

  H77_nation_desc:0 "Ovdal Lodhum was known as the Hold where Love Lives, and was known for its beautiful architecture and as a perfect honeymoon spot for newlywed dwarves of the old empire. After the fall, it was one of the few holds that survived—after all, love always prevails."

  H76_nation_desc:0 "The nominal capital of the Serpentreach, Arg-Ôrdstun was home to the proud and strong diamond dwarves who in their time often challenged the authority of the High King of Aul-Dwarov. If this hold is ever restored, perhaps the days of Ôrdstunic power will one day return?"

  diggy_remnant_stagnation.1.d:0 "For millennia, we have waited within the safety of our hold. As the Dwarovar burned around us, admist the chaos of orc and goblin invasions, we closed our gates, and waited. Now, however, the time for waiting has ended. We must go out, reclaim the Dwarovar, and build a great Dwarven nation once more! Out of our populace emerge three factions, the Reclaimers, the Expansionists, and the [Root.GetAdjective] Guard.\n\nThe Reclaimers share a vision of a great capital, a beautiful and magnificent hold like the stories of Aul-Dwarov mention, monumental megastructures that reach deep down into Halann, towards the very center of the world. It is their belief that only through these artistic and architectural endeavours we can ensure that our society shall not fail again.\n\nThe Expansionists advocate for a massive colonization effort into the old dwarven railways, the veins and arteries of Aul-Dwarov, and the many caverns that line these roads. By ensuring that these regions are safe, they say, we can sleep soundly again, knowing that no orc, no goblin can assault us again.\n\nThe [Root.GetAdjective] Guard stands for our military might, combat prowess, and tactical superiority. To ensure that the Last Days of the Dwarovar, the thousand-year decline of our old empire within the mountains of the Serpentspine, will never repeat we need to be better prepared for the dangers that still lurk outside of our gates. Only with a well-equipped army can we ensure the safety of our hold.\n\nAt last there are also the Beholden, a group of older dwarves who oppose this endeavour, both out of fear of the dangers ahead and outside, as well as a hatred of any and all change to our country. Their leaders have announced that they will try to stop us in any way they can, even willing to use force, if the need arises.\n\nThe question now faces us: what shall be our first step?"

  blorc.2863.desc:0 "Khugdihr's immense vaults once held enough wealth to begin one of the world's largest banks when its survivors fled from its fall, which still drives the economy of much of the far off Dameshead to this day. These vaults held artefacts and treasures beyond compare, including the legendary Gem of Asra, once belonging to our kin in nearby hold of Ovdal Asra before Fognir Asra and his adventurers collapsed that it. Now the city holds no treasures but the vaults themselves and a vast gate leading out into Escann, for we have taken their many treasures and made them our own. Still it is a shame to have such vaults lie empty when they could be filled with the wealth of our [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle]. Let us go out one more into these new lands, and fill all our lands with Orcish plunder."
  blorc.2868.desc:0 "Unlike the dwarvern forges found in other holds throughout the Serpentspine, the workshops and warehouses of Haraz Orldhûm have their walls lined with shackles and chains to hold the slaves that worked them. Layer after layer, built by goblin workers to hold their brethren in slavery to dwarven masters, as they were kept from the glory of combat and forced to labour for their masters' enrichment. But they would not be masters forever. Power goes to the strongest, and the slavemasters could not stand up to Orcish might. Former slave and slaver now share the same coffle, serving truer masters. Goblin and dwarf slaves now fire the ancient forges, and build the shackles we shall use to enslave all who oppose us."
  blorc.4119.desc:0 "We have fought the dwarves for so long, the days when they were actually organized together, rather than merely dying alone, are merely held in our shamans' myths. But we know this: when they were unified, they were unified under Amldihr.\n\nStill, those days are a relic now. A relic like the one we discovered in seizing Amldihr for our own: a well-worn crown, missing its gems, but made of some precious metal, enchanted with strange magics, and carved with the most ornate of runes. Whatever it once was, it shall now adorn the throne room of [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName], a piece to remind all of [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetHerHis] dominance over the Serpentspine, and the orcs who rule it. It shall never, ever, be anything more than that."
  blorc.4208.desc:0 "The campaigns we led against the dwarves in the frigid wastes of their northernmost hold were long, arduous undertakings that brought the forces of our [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] to conflict with some of the most bloodthirsty and determined dwarves we've ever fought, cloaked in the almost servile cold that, at times, threatened to slow our unrelenting charge into their precious capital.\n\nThere is not much to behold of this place we have conquered, with its habitants barely more than the descendants of disgraced misfits and their meager hoards. Instead, we walk away with something infinitely more precious: the legacy of our triumph over the elements themselves."
  blorc.4020.desc:0 "The Hold of Dûr-Vazhatun, once the scholarly center of the dwarves, has laid in ruins for millennia, rusting and decaying. Now, it has fallen into our hands, and within it, our armies found a vast amount of surprising discoveries. An amphitheatre, its purpose lost to time. A gigantic room, lined with shelves upon shelves of mostly useless books. Large workshops, filled with various things, contraptions of glass and tubes, various flasks, rusted machinery, gears, and cogs.  Most strange of all, at the top of the hold, a room of shattered glass and a rusted dome that opens onto the peak of the mountains. These damned dwarves have always used their books, guns, and machinery against us, and even when they are long gone, their incomprehensible machines often pose as obstacles blocking our goals. However, throughout these workshops and among the shelves of books, there are schematics and instructions, filled with helpful pictures, and not simply scratched in their cursed language. They contain information on how some of the decaying weapons and mysterious machinery found throughout the Dwarovar work. Armed with this knowledge, our glorious warband may find surviving in the detritus of this weak and demolished empire somewhat easier."
  blorc.4147.desc:0 "Plenty of dwarves would tell the stories of charges through the interior of the mountain, rams and riders clad in ramsteel and throwing back any orcish attempt at intrusion. Now with the taking of this hold we prove those tales a lie. Some of their stories still ring true though, especially those concerned with the taste of their mutton or the weight of their lambs and ewes. Whether stewed, roasted or boiled they make a fine delicacy, and help both our warriors and our young ones grow fast and strong. "
  blorc.4236.desc:0 "Honours and treasures aplenty always end up in the hands of those soldiers who first let foot inside of a newly conquered hold, whether due to ritual or circumstance. Here though the orcish vanguard was especially well rewarded as may of them claimed a set of mithril armour from the plundered remains of the captured armoury. Now as long as these orcs or their descendants serve in our armies the tip of every lance and the blade of every sword will be turned aside by our front-most troops, giving us still greater successes on the battlefield."
  blorc.2931.desc:0 "Er-Natvir, the center of the dwarovar, has long stood as an affront to the will of Dookan and the righteous mandate we hold over the dwarves. Like a failing heart, it pumped the necessary goods that kept the bleeding corpse that was Aul-Dwarov alive for as long as it did, defiant to keep itself and its vestigial holds alive, only to prolong its own suffering.\n\nHaving now conquered and are in full control of the heart and its assembly line, our forces have turned this dying heart into a working factory of orcish design, giving us the means necessary to run amok through its veins."
  blorc.4056.desc:0 "Verkal Kozenad was the first hold to fall when we burst out of Hul Jorkad and showed all the Serpentspine our might. Now we have again taken this old hold, and though our ancestors were quite successful in looting it, we have managed to find a few more trophies that they missed.\n\nIn particular is a collection of strange fluids and papers, tucked away in deep-buried alcove. Some testing by the orcs least-bloodied in its conquest showed the liquids are poisonous to drink, disgusting when used as a sauce — but priceless when used as ink for messages we would like to keep secret. We shall reserve this supply for the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle]'s most important letters, and ensure none dare to poke their nose where it does not belong. "
  blorc.2963.desc:0 "The Dwarovar is ours, and orcs can be found across the Serpentspine. But if there is anything we share, anything that thrums through all of us, it is rooted in Hul-Jorkad. To own that hold, to ensure the dwarves are expunged from its halls, their mighty walls torn down and their deep dungeons destroyed, it somehow speaks to the very nature of every orc. And with that done, we shall be even more united in our Dookan-given purpose."
  blorc.4238.desc:0 "We had hardly held Orlghelovar a week, were still cleaning the shattered glass that littered its floors, when we spotted the first merchant caravan arriving. They did not look askance at the Hold's new occupants, and were quick to get to business.\n\nApparently, they hail from a city called Nathalaire, and consider it their god-given purpose to trade widely and freely. And they made clear to one of the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle]'s favored chieftains that whatever we had for sale, they'd be happy to take to market, no questions asked. It seems a very profitable partnership approaches!"
  blorc.2942.desc:0 "When we made our way into the marble hold of Shazstundihr, amidst broken statues and defaced marble arches we found a sight well-known to orcish eyes: the trappings of goblin residence. It was only when we first ventured outside the Hold into the blinding light of the nearby hills that we saw why: Goblins had been here, and had left, wisely leaving this abode and saving us the need to kill them for it.\n\nStill, this means we have opportunities aplenty in the surrounding lands. Perhaps the goblins have tribute they would be willing to offer to keep us away, perhaps even the humans can learn a similar relationship. And already there are whispers of even more we might learn, hints of a new purpose or meaning. Where these are coming from, [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] does not know, but [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetSheHe] does know that clearly there is much to be learned outside Shazstundihr's gates."
  blorc.4093.desc:0 "Amidst the heaving death of the empire of the dwarves, there was, for a time, a singular beacon of hope among the dwarves: Arg-Ôrdstun. Not even the most fanatical of our brethren, for a time, had the ability to break through its formidable defenses, forcing us back to retreat and rethink, time and time again. The dwarves of the place grew defiant, proud, comfortable even in the false pretense that — so long as the walls stood — Arg-Ôrdstun and her peoples were safe, even if it meant they were to be the last of their kind.\n\nOur defilation of this place was done with great prejudice and pleasure, the husk of this ruined hold serving as a reminder to all, orcs or otherwise, that it is not a case of if, but when we will bring all the Serpentspine to its knees"
  blorc.4100.desc:0 "Verkal Skomdihr was long tested as a fortress, facing countless attacks by the fey and so piling vaults high with powder and shot for each time they came to besiege the fortress. All that meant nothing when we arrived though, except that those same guns they were so proud of could be taken from their dead and wielded by proud orcs in our ever-growing army. Though we've taken trophies from every dwarfish band that broke before us this time we found huge warehouses piled high with ammunition, armouries stoked with spare rifles and beyond that... the Deepwoods themselves. Trees from which to carve new stocks, hunting grounds to give young ones practice and even a few pitiable orcs bleeding back in from the forest, chased from their homes and all too ready to die for us. More so than ever before, every orc in our empire shall be armed and ready to fight."
  blorc.2973.desc:0 "The conquest of Ovdal Lodhum left many a pink banner trampled in the mud. But they did fight fiercely, better-trained and with more discipline than most dwarves we had crushed before us. We forced our way through a tunnel inundated with burning pitch, savaged their forces that used strange crystal lights for tunnel fighting. They gave us no quarter, and were commendably brutal in their fighting — but they fell, like all dwarves shall before orcish blade.\n\nIt is only in seizing the Hold's deepest reaches did we begin to see the reason behind their impressive showing. [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] came across, in a place of high honour, a blade blue steel stained deep with blood, a blade known to every orc, one that features in the scary stories we tell our children and even an adult's nightmares. The blade Orcrend, wielded by the one they call Trickster, who slew thousand upon thousand of orcs and never fell in turn to our axe or spear. It seems he was indeed a man, and not just a ghost or spectre, and must have settled in this hold.\n\nBut the time where orcs were killed is past, now it is time for orcs to do the killing. Orcrend shall be taken to an anvil, and hammered by the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] until it shatters. We have slain a nightmare, and all orcs shall breath easier for it."
  blorc.4039.desc:0 "The tunnels and caverns of the Serpentspine have always been hostile to orcs, the constrained spaces and desolate rock a good whetstone for our strength and fury. But never had we found a place where the land itself seemed to oppose our war as when taking Gor Bûrad.\n\nWe felt the heat as soon as we approached, but even then did not expect the lava moats, nor the furious dwarves. They took many orcs' lives, demanded a new approach, and for a moment [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] dispaired of conquering the Hold.\n\nBut only for a moment. Our fury and ferocity burns hotter than even molten rock; the Hold could not hold us off forever. And the lessons we learned in taking it shall ensure that all the others fall quicker as well."
  blorc.4217.desc:0 "After our capture of Gor Vazumbrog our horde were given permission to sack the hold. While such an opportunity is not rare, our warriors didn't waste a moment in scouring the depth in hopes of finding anything of worth. What was found in the hold shocked us. The Skewered Drake clan is well known for having slain a Drake that once inhabited this hold, what was not known was they enslaved one of its children, using it's to breed mounts and using its searing breath to fuel their furnaces.\n\nWe control Gor Vazumbrog, and with it we control this ancient drake."
  blorc.4078.desc:0 "No orc worthy of the name would ever admit to fearing a dwarf. Even the fiercest warriors among them might be respected, at most, and the nightmare of Orcbane is no dwarf at all, either a human or some haunting spectre.\n\nBut reports from the cleverest orcs, who [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] sent into the depths of Hehodovar, indicate that... perhaps... a dwarf has finally earned that designation. For in the Hold's oldest passageways, apparently, books and manuals have been found in a hand still legible, said to be the hand of the Hold's founder himself, Hehogrim. While normally we would burn any such relics, these refuse to catch alight. And from the ashen faces among the orcs who read those texts, the mind is brilliant and terrifying in its brilliance.\n\nThere is undoubtedly a lot to be learned from these works, even for us. But they must only be read by one of [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName]'s advisors, never the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] — it would undoubtedly inspire an Ozarm'Chadash if [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetSheHe] could credibly be said to fear any dwarf, and that might just happen if [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetSheHe] looks upon Hehogrim's works directly."
  blorc.4124.desc:0 "Seghdihr, and the Segbandal they led, fought our ancestors to a stand-still as they tried to enter the Central Serpentspine. But we are not our ancestors: we are stronger, fiercer, tougher. We would ask the Citrine Dwarves if that has been made clear to them, but living ones are few and far between within the Hold's halls nowadays — corpses, of course, still litter the ground everywhere.\n\nWe will, however, undoubtedly see that truth in the eyes of those who deal with us, the cowardice of those would would oppose us — whatever stopped orcs before, wherever we were held back, it shall not survive the [Root.Owner.GetName] onslaught."
  blorc.2914.desc:0 "The Dwarovar is a rich land. And we have seized many riches in showing it the might of orcish fist and blade and bullet. But none compares to the treasury of Verkal Gulan, big enough that [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] could be fully submerged within.\n\nIt is enough to give every soldier double the pay, fulfill the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle]'s wildest dreams, with plenty left over. And as for that remainder's use? Well, already there are merchants at the Hero's Gates, willing to take any deal with the Hold's new conquerors for a piece of its riches. And now that we have coinage aplenty, we shall be able to do more than just bargain with them."
  blorc.4218.desc:0 "Many fortresses have fallen as we win the Serpentspine with tooth and claw and blade. This one, Gor Ozumbrog, would be just another in the list if it was not for its positioning on the eastern edge of the Serpentspine. One of our generals has remarked that it seems a halfway point, because of that: halfway through the Serpentspine, halfway to fulfilling our glorious Dookan-given destiny.\n\nIt serves as a reminder, too. So much has fallen before us — and we must not lose it in turn. So much has been taken, and must be kept. The enemies gates have fallen, ours must stand strong. Here in Gor Ozumbrog, and everywhere."
  blorc.4247.desc:0 "The guns of Ovdal Kanzad took their toll. [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] knew they would went [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetSheHe] sent the forces against its walls. The massive batteries that manned its gates produced booms that could be heard from leagues away, and the forces that ultimately took it had climbed over vast piles of orcish corpses to get there.\n\nBut the deed is done. Ovdal Kanzad has fallen. And we have learned a thing or two about enduring unrelenting cannonfire in the process."
  blorc.4265.desc:0 "As our armies marched into the vanquished Hold of Grôzumdihr, they noticed a strange gate at its entrance, with Dwarven words inscribed in a strangely-lit green stone. It seemed not worth the effort to pry those jewels from their place, and so when one of the more learned shamans with some understanding of that strange tongue entered, she could decipher some of what it said.\n\nWhich revealed an odd discovery. Apparently our conquest was welcome? It was inevitable, of course, but the dwarves are strange to have invited it. Perhaps that is why they fell so easily.\n\nTheir seeming disposition did mean our looting was somewhat less violent than usual, which left a strange set of papers unburned, and unshredded. [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] has claimed them for [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself], and only time will tell what [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetSheHe] may learn from them."
  blorc.4284.desc:0 "Ovdal-az-Ân, the greatest goblin hold, has fallen. As the hold falls our orcs swarm the structure there seems to be an extra layer of savagery on top of the usual battle rage and the reason for this becomes quickly apparent. The goblins here had the audacity to keep our brethren as slaves, being forced to mine the depths of the hold.\n\nThe head of the goblin who ruled this hold is brought to our [From.Monarch.GetTitle], an immensely forgettable goblin but his head will serve as reminder to the enslaved remnants of their clan when they take our brothers' place in the mines."
  blorc.4266.desc:0 "The ale we've seized from the dwarves in our conquests has been hearty stuff, and rumor has that it is deadly to non-dwarves (and, apparently, non-orcs). But we, on the other hand, have been deadly to dwarves, and we need a brew that'll match that trait.\n\nNow that we control the distilleries of Hul-az-Krakazol, we can get to work on brewing such a drink. And if we give a sip or two to our warriors before battle (and a few more as reward if they fight well), we shall undoubtedly see a new level of fury expressed in our fighting."
  blorc.4350.desc:0 "For millennia we have forced goblins to serve orcish might, a generous reward when compared to simply slaughtering them and letting their blood water the Serpentspine's caverns. But in taking Tuwad-Dhûmankon, and slaying its residents, we have seen evidence of a more concerted effort towards the enslaving of these creatures.\n\nA systematic hierarchy, detailed requirements and tribute payments, precise demands — clearly the Hobgoblins' similarity to their lesser brethren has forced them to be organized in the organization of their slavery. These should be even more effective when backed by orcish fury, ferocity, and steel, and [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] will take a look over what we have found in the Hold to see what might be applied to the goblins that serve [Root.Owner.GetName]."
  blorc.4311.desc:0 "We are used to dominating the Dwarovar. Holds' wall fall before our onslaught, the dwarves are crushed into the ground they love, goblins left a green smear on cavern walls. But the hobgoblins? They reminded us why the Dwarovar is a place of blood and brutal battle, even for us orcs.\n\nTheir solid lines would not break before a mighty charge, even when most would turn and run. Their well-trained soldiers would not shatter before sword and axe and orcish might. Their discipline could withstand bloody losses, and not crumble.\n\nBut they fell, nonetheless. We have taken Grônstunad, the brightest of the Holds they rule. And all their solid forces, their impressive armies — well, it has just made an excellent whetstone on which to sharpen the blade of our troops."
  blorc.4323.desc:0 "At the easternmost end of the Serpentspine we have found the dwarves' most well-hidden hold, a bizarre place that unsettled the troops just from being inside it. Our warriors, upon storming the place, were lulled after their conquests into a sleep that was far from natural; with many warriors describing visions that ranged from the crumbling walls of structures that pierced the sky, to sandstorms of night-black sands billowing from the mountains and onto the thirsting earth.\n\nOur shamans took immediate interest in the hold and came to survey it, noting the change in behavior of the now permanent orc residents who seemed to be a more wary sort than the usual, citing their odd yet not unwelcome dreams as the source of their change. It appeared the root of the mystery, as with all things in the Dwarovar, was buried - this time in the depths of the unconscious mind.

  blorc.50.t:0 "Planning The Ozarm'Chadash"
  blorc.50.d:0 "The Ozarm'Chadash is an ancient tradition in orc society, perhaps even the oldest. In a traditional sense it is a way for the have nots to take from the haves, a means for the strong youth to take from the decaying old. If an orc holds a title, a wife, an axe or even an entire tribe a challenger can duel them for it, risking both lives in the process. A Ozarm'Chadash (Duel For Honor in Orcish) is a fight to the death if the winner decides so, but the loser is occasionally spared by the victor, often for extra humiliation.\n\nIn our case we are planning to challenge one of the minor chieftains occupying one of the decrepid holds in the periphery of our realm. These lesser chiefs who infest their holds never last long in their dog-eat-dog world, meaning they will not refuse, as that is surely the largest sign of weakness in orc society.\n\nWhich chieftain do we challenge?"

As thousands of orcs gather outside the gate to see this duel between the past and the future, [ROOT.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] sharpens their axe one last time."

However, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] was spared. The axe a mere inch from their face, penetrating into the cave-floor. The orcs of [duel_target_blorc.GetName] began chanting the name of their victorious chief, as [ROOT.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] attempted to get up, heavily bleeding and shamed, and motioned to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] men to carry [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] out."
  blorc.53.a:0 "Get me out of here"
  blorc.54.t:0 "A new Chief!"
  blorc.54.d:0 "As the chieftain of [duel_target_blorc.GetName] brought down their axe, splitting the skull of [ROOT.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] wide open, a silence went through the crowd. Soon the silence broke into cheering coming from [duel_target_blorc.GetName]'s side of the crowd, as the chief claimed the regalia of [Root.Monarch.GetName] for themselves and the personal guard of [Root.Monarch.GetName] began swearing their loyalty to the new $MONARCHTITLE$. As the new $MONARCHTITLE$ began marching towards the capital, with the mutilated head of the old $MONARCHTITLE$ as proof, a new era for the [Root.GovernmentName] ushered in."
