 thangoya_1_5_title:0 "Memory of A Sunrise"
 thangoya_1_5_desc:0 "Hiderion's state may've been defeated, but it doesn't mean that his ideals are dead. The elven communities of Azkare still hold true to many of his ideals, promoting equality of all races, cultures and origins under the parliament of united townships. With enough encouragment, they can be a key factor in turning the ones who may still doubt in the cause of our republic into the united force of Kai that we strive for."
 thangoya_1_6_title:0 "Centuries of Horsemanship"
 thangoya_1_6_desc:0 "If there is one thing Sikai should be known about, it's their Purebred horses. Bred specifically for their speed and strength in stables of Khao Elnak, these steeds are the best in dealing devastating charges to the opponents. Yet on the fields of Lektonmai, the quality of the horses weren't the main factor in deciding the battle's outcome. With both sides riding the Purebreds, it was the Azkarean training that caused their devastating victory, much to the surprise of everyone. We shall embrace their tactics, taking a new step in the Sikai cavalry doctrine."
 thangoya_1_7_title:0 "Forming New Industries"
 thangoya_1_7_desc:0 "Compared to other areas of the world, Thangoya doesn't offer many luxury materials. Barring the mines of Phungoen and small Khanvuphaim establishments, the only thing we can really offer are grain and livestock. There is a need for investment into establishment of new businesses, prospecting for new resources or looking to use current ones in a new way."
 thangoya_1_9_title:0 "Attract the Artisans"
 thangoya_1_9_desc:0 "With the small industries covered, there is a solid base of inexperienced craftsmen ready to contribute into large scale projects."
 thangoya_1_10_title:0 "All Citizens Aboard"
 thangoya_1_10_desc:0 "If our country wants to make the leap forward, we need to use everything in our sleeves to execute our plans. The mages of our country have been rather underutilised and they have spoken out about it, suggesting a new bill to introduce them into construction sites, where they can serve a plethora of assignments, from evocating fire into the forges to material repair and reconstruction."
 thangoya_1_11_title:0 "To Forge"
 thangoya_1_11_desc:0 "The hills bordering us and Xianjie are known for their large reserves of metals, especially bronze and silver. The extraction of these have been the first and foremost export of the Sikai since the long forgotten dawn of the first kingdom. When our country prospered, so did the metallurgic magnates, profiteering at the top of social ladder. Let us give them proper representation and privileges, so that they can fully profit off of their industry as the foremost example of success in the republic."

 thangoya_2_5_title:0 "Funnel the Xia"
 thangoya_2_5_desc:0 "The spirit of Xianjie is far from its unwavering status quo. The brutality and cunning of the Hobgoblin Command, combined with their recent sweep of the Shamakhad prompted panic in the wider Xiaken population, many of them losing faith in the Wulin and escaping into realms further away from the frontlines. The Republic can provide a safe haven for thousands of refugees, but the monks need a proper show of strength and faith before they will start preferring us over anybody else."
 thangoya_2_6_title:0 "Contesting the Wulin"
 thangoya_2_6_desc:0 "With the Great Command making their first steps into Xianjie, it became clear that it wouldn't be a short campaign for both sides. While both sides will exhaust their resources, an opportunity arises for those brave enough to exploit the power vaccum that will be inevitably left after Xiadao falls. It is our duty to save as many Xiaken from the Hobgoblins as possible and provide them with firm, but fair treatment, so they can try and fight back from a safer position."
 thangoya_2_8_title:0 "Finishing the Fundaments"
 thangoya_2_8_desc:0 "The plan is set. After a long and crunched out planning process, a project spanning tens, even hundreds of years was birthed, covering the development of each and every town and village in Thangoya. To put it into reality, we have to provide ourselves tools, craftsmen and facilities to house their work that will be the backbone of our future endeavours."
 thangoya_2_9_title:0 "Silver Net"
 thangoya_2_9_desc:0 "The Golden Highway is the greatest infrastructural project ever built in the world. The size and detail of it is unlike anything else in the world, connecting far corners of the world in a way unseen anywhere else in the world. We are going to base on it and make our own Silver Net."
 thangoya_2_10_title:0 "To Feed"
 thangoya_2_10_desc:0 "For many years, grain and livestock exports were the backbone of the poorer townships, consistently having an abundance of food as there were not many mouths to eat in the first place. While our recent initiatives resulted in growth in pretty much every sector of our economy, one of the branches that fell behind was the army, as it pretty much stayed in the same shape since the unification of Townships."
 thangoya_2_12_title:0 "The Sikai Metropolis"
 thangoya_2_12_desc:0 "We. /nAre big, large, huge, humongous."

 thangoya_3_6_title:0 "Silver and Bronze"
 thangoya_3_6_desc:0 "The Shield Monks of Lo Pashong and the Silver Shields of Lo Ngoen have shared similar traditions, somehow disconnected from each other. Let us link those traditions to create a steady frontline, that can embrace any charge and outduel their opponents with martial prowess and equipment advantage."
 thangoya_3_7_title:0 "How To Govern"
 thangoya_3_7_desc:0 "Even to its denizens, the dwarven holds are an administrative marvel, housing whole countries in the depths of a single mountain. Surely, similar feats can be done on the lush and fertile lands of Thangoya, right? We only need to know how."
 thangoya_3_9_title:0 "Bartering with Sikhawlom"
 thangoya_3_9_desc:0 "Sikhawlom Desert is a phenomena. A barren desert, standing between lush and fertile grasslands of Hukai and Telebei, occupied by thousands of unknown spirits, eternally grieving an unknown cause, whirlwinding across the desert, their tears turning into salt, which gave the desert its name - White Wind. The druiding circles of Phudban have been researching this spirits for a long time and perhaps with the resources that our state has, they may calm or perhaps banish the spirits and make the land hospitable."
 thangoya_3_10_title:0 "City of Adventurers"
 thangoya_3_10_desc:0 "Haiban has for the longest time the center of Sikai trade and a hub for many packs of adventurers, ones who did not appreciate the bureaucratic and political approach of the Lot Dekkhangi Daulophs. Let's double down on the leniency for the adventurers and let them advertise our markets and our new products."
 thangoya_3_11_title:0 "To Clothe"
 thangoya_3_11_desc:0 "The splendor of a society is dependent on the amount of luxuries and art they can afford. One of the luxuries we have are the cotton and Khanvuphaim industries, producing high end clothing. That said our products couldn't reliably break through even in local markets, due to the preexisting monopolies of Raheni Silk plantators who outcompete our products through both backdoor deals and the availablility of their products. Expanding our output simply won't do enough. If we want our textiles to truly succeed we need to procure them with state-enforced monopolies to ensure they have a stable market they can profit off."
 thangoya_3_13_title:0 "An Army of Seven Races"
 thangoya_3_13_desc:0 "Harpy Skirmishers, Harimari Quartermasters, Dwarven Artillerists, Human Linemen, Kobold Sappers, Elven Generals, Hobgoblin Drillmasters. Our army is a well oiled machine."

 thangoya_4_5_title:0 "Recovering the Land"
 thangoya_4_5_desc:0 "The wars of unification put the Townships into chaos of an unprecedented scale. With territories changing hands multiple times in the span of such little time, it is no wonder that its people are confused and unsure of their future. Before the Republic is able to embark on the next campaign, we need to provide reassurance to the common citizen, so that they are aware that Thangoya is there to stay and support their needs."
 thangoya_4_6_title:0 "Turning Tables"
 thangoya_4_6_desc:0 "Eversince our revolt under the mantle of the first Sikai Kingdom, our relations with the Nephrite Dwarves never fully recovered. While the flow of goods and people stays normal compared to the rest of our neighbours, the Kings of Verkal Ozovar stay vigilant in their effort to call themselves the sovereign of all Kai people, looking down on the independent human states. How ironic it is now that they're backed into a corner, trying to show a glimpse of relevancy in the War for the Mantle of Baihon Xinh. Unfortunately for them, this intervention leaves them vulnerable should a third party was to intervene and liberate their last line of defense in the form our brethren in Hinphat Lordships."
 thangoya_4_8_title:0 "People Without a State"
 thangoya_4_8_desc:0 "The Phonan have been long living under the oppression of the Khom regime of Baihon Xinh, which consitently gatekept them from obtaining any important positions under many layers of deeply rooted nepotism. Despite the attempts to Khom-ify their culture, Phonan showed time after time that they are people of distinct identity, one suppressed but nonetheless present. We should take them into our fold, give them the space and power to let them flourish and cultivate the beauty of their culture."
 thangoya_4_9_title:0 "Gate To Thidinkai"
 thangoya_4_9_desc:0 "The port of Cay Cam Sinh has for a long time been the greatest port of Kai, its vital position at the mouth of the Khom Ma river providing monopoly on the trade goods from eastern Thidinkai to the wider trade communities of the Gulf of Rahen. Now that it is in hands of the Republic, we shall make sure to take necessary measures to profit off the rich trade routes it provides."
 thangoya_4_10_title:0 "Under New Management"
 thangoya_4_10_desc:0 "While conquering the Kai is a great undertaking in itself, we are fully aware that empires unlike ours have fallen as easily as they rose, unable to establish a new status quo. If we want to truly drive away the monarchist traditions from our territories, we have to establish a new standard, that the people can accept and cultivate even after we inevitably fall. The Harimari communities, bearing the legacy of the Harimraj, are known as the administrators of great empires across the whole continent. We should employ their expertise in governing systems and managing diverse arrays of people, to create a truly tolerant and unbiased society that we strive for."
 thangoya_4_12_title:0 "Thidinkai United"
 thangoya_4_12_desc:0 "Hey, you integrated all of the possible races in Haless, good job!"

 thangoya_5_5_title:0 "Steelbound Lords"
 thangoya_5_5_desc:0 "The Methnikhren of Lot Dekkhang have been a longstanding threat against the Townships, their attempts at subjugating Khao Elnak being the most recent example of it. We have to choose whether we want to decouple from their influences, turn it against them or fully embrace it as their loyal subject."
 thangoya_5_6_title:0 "Secure the Middle Course"
 thangoya_5_6_desc:0 "Many would dub the lands in the upper Hukai and Telebei the "Breadbasket of Haless" and rightfully so. The rivers provide plenty of fertile land, that provide food for tons of people across the continent. While we were fractured, we weren't able to fully cherish the benefits of this trade, as our profit margin was split inbetween tens of middlemen. Right wow we are large enough to proactively reduce the amount of middlemen by reigning in some countries down the rivers, significantly improving the Republic's influence over trade."
 thangoya_5_7_title:0 "First Kai State"
 thangoya_5_7_desc:0 "The Unbreakable Kai are known for their staunch desire for independence. Their country's history is something they take great pride in, steeming from the ancient revolt that against the Nephrite Dwarves of Verkal Ozovar, the first among the Kai to do so, leading as an example for the rest, including us, to follow suit. If we want to secure their support for the Republic, we need to overcome their desire to preserve the Kudet Kai and unfortunately there might be only one way to do that..."
 thangoya_5_9_title:0 "Heavy Duty Cavalry"
 thangoya_5_9_desc:0 "The most distant of the Kai brethren, Binhrung people possess the valuable technology of the gem encrusted armor. Now that they are under our governance, we can merge this technology with what we have now to create the best armor money can buy."
