 giberd_ready_the_anvil_desc:0 "Our die has been cast and with it our plans begin. Delda Glibgear heads to Silverforge, intent on discussing our nation’s future plans of conquest with a close friend, knowing that the dwarves would gladly come to help us if we asked for aid. The gambit must not fail - Giberd is willing to play each and every card in its deck to ensure victory and begin the slow but important steps towards establishing Giberd in the EOA."

 giberd_onwards_to_esmaria_desc:0 "Progress is sometimes bombastic and quick, a surge of exciting progress into the future that awaits ahead, and sometimes it is gruelling, earned  one footfall at a time. After the collapse of the Duchy, the squabbling inheritors turn upon each other like hungry beasts and we do not have much time before their hungry eyes turn upon us! To protect our kin and our future, let us integrate these squabbling kingdoms and reach out to our old chums in the Gommo - after all, if there’s something worth doing, it’s worth doing right!"
 giberd_not_just_a_mere_cog_title:0 "Not Just A Mere Cog"
 giberd_not_just_a_mere_cog_desc:0 "There are two main benefits to the conquest of Esmaria, and two main drawbacks. With this conquest we gain resources enough to secure our existence after the tragic collapse of the old generous dukedom, and prove our might enough to stake claim on Esmaria and the electorship lost! We also need never again  hear anymore blasted jokes about being too small.\n\nOn the other hand, across the realm, the estates seem to think of us as some sort of violent foreign conqueror, from the chittering of pleasure barges to the depths of the foundries of Telgir… and there’s no end of jokes about us compensating for our height.\n\nTo solve this two-pronged problem, let us put on a proper show of just how Esmari and generous we are.  Worship of the deities of the land and greasing the wheels of diplomacy with some generous gifts to the other electors will win us support for our claim, enshrining us as the rightful rulers of Esmari, and calming the gossips and busybodies with the sureness of our support abroad"

This is about fitting, given the direction of our good ole government, for as technocratic as we gnomes remain, we’re Esmari as well. Its only fitting ‘that we adapt our government to the needs of our people, and to that end, why not open a place of wondrous learning for the precious young - gnomish or otherwise - to become the next generation of artificers!"

Well, enough is enough - loathe are we to lose our temper, but what else is there to do! We shall outcompete them, starve their trade, ensure the world is buying Giberdi glass first and foremost, and we’ll watch with glee as their rotten city crumples under its own weight, until not even the Emperor wants a single thing to do with its rickety remains!"

Of course, we can’t simply let this gold go to waste when we’ve so much still to do - especially considering we still need to impress and awe the other electors, so they may recognize and support our claim.\n\nIn typical Esmari fashion, we’ve already figured out the best way to do this, and it’s the best, comfiest and most impressive boat to ever sail the Esmar! Constructing and planning the beast will be costly, but the reward is more than sweet enough to have our finest artificers chomping at the bit to get started."

Unfortunately, doing so has proven dastardly, explosive, and all around quite a hassle. Fortunately, a fine thinker by the name of Froy Clevercog has well and truly come to a genius conclusion. We can use the- nearly- uninhabited and abandoned lands of the Bennonhills as a place to test out our more dangerous inventions! We just need to shoo out the locals and ensure our artificers can remain safe out there.\n\nThe side benefit - that any would-be northern invader would thus have to march into the active experimental firing lines, is of course just a coincidence."

Fortunately, the Songbarges and Cann Esmar being ours makes our dreams even closer to reality. Let us commission, fund and house the bards of Seinathil and the smiths of Telgir in equal measure, one to sing of our common Esmari destiny, and the other to dig in deep and protect against any who would seek to rob us of that destiny."

The rolling hills, the vast fields and rolling forests, the proud and beautiful Esmar, and of course, the city of wonder herself, Giberd. The greatest of the cities of Esmaria, whose wealth, genius and power has seen this once-divided land  nearly brought together again. With Giberdi glass furnishing the halls of near-enough every home in the empire, is it no wonder that many are beginning to consider it the centre of Esmaria? With a little push more, we can make sure none even takes  umbrage with such claims!"

Well, most of them anyway. The Chroniclers- a subdivision of the Magisterium- are a most lovely bunch! Their hunger for knowledge is second only to ours, and  it’d do wonders for the Magisterium's trust if we welcomed these chroniclers into our adventuring companies, for progress and knowledge! "

From the smoggy halls of Telgir, to the songhalls of Seinathil, past redeemed Esmaraine and onto the city of wonders herself, Giberd.

 giberd_trading_in_damestear_desc:0 "As our Artificery becomes more complicated, it becomes readily apparent that we’ve need of greater and greater materials, that our mighty machines might continue to grow in complexity and ability. Most prevalent of these demands is the lifeblood of magic itself, Damestear, which is both scarce and terribly expensive. We must begin talks with the owner of the Moonisle - a massive source of Damestear - so that we might slate our hunger for the bedrock of the future!"

 giberd_wind_in_our_sails_desc:0 "Trade makes the world go around, and we’ve only become more aware of this fact as our power over Esmaria has grown. Now that the lush lands of the Esmar are in our control, a few brilliant minds have devised a most ingenious device indeed, the mighty Wind Tower. Large artificiered windmills, these would ensure eternally favourable winds for our tradeships up and down the rivers of Esmaria. This will revolutionise the speed and efficiency of our trade!"

No longer a mere school, the academy is now far closer to a university! Let us celebrate this piece of our history and its growth, so that all might share in its knowledge!"

Despite our customary sangfroid, even we would struggle to calm the terrified populace without help. Fortunately, help does exist! The charitable Ravelians- whilst quite odd- would be a boon to our realm’s knowledge, and are willing to provide alms to the panicking peoples if we welcome them into our realm and protection. "
 giberd_the_pinklady_power_title:0 "The Pinklady's Power"
 giberd_the_pinklady_power_desc:0 "Fair Esmar has many branches and tributaries, and trade flows down these rivers like the water in its streams. For us to control the wealth of the river and Esmaria, we must find some sort of arrangement regarding the last major external tributary of the Esmar in Pinklady, held by Estallen. What exactly this arrangement should be is of great debate, with some voices calling for a total embargo, others for all-out war, and more mild voices for a purchase of trading rights upon these rivers- though the cost will surely be heavy."

Now, naturally, Esmaria is a lovely place to live anyway- thanks in large part to our genius guidance- but we’ve more to do yet! With the power of artificery, some have begun to wonder if we couldn’t massively increase the yield of crops and cattlefeed across our realm, stoking our economy, feeding our needy and supplying our army- or perhaps even creating a new delicacy. Either way, the only way to find out is to try, so that our people may reap the reward! Let it be known that none shall starve in our realm!"

The three technocratic factions found no agreement:, the Mechanists advocated all possible means to save Giberd , the Technomancers insisted on diplomatic manoeuvre and the rule of international law,  while the Brillites floundered hopelessly for  a middle ground.. Over and over the same ground was retrod , month after month, till even gnomes could no longer stand to watch and the halls lay almost empty.\n\nIn that despairing fashion, one night silence finally fell upon the halls once more. Having failed to come to an agreement for so long, the three factions had reached an unpalatable conclusion - there simply was no consensus to be reached. One voice must be empowered to decide Giberd’s fate, trusted with the tools of war.\n\nThe next day three plans of action are offered by representatives of each faction to Delda Glibgear’s office and the choice is placed in  her hands."

A mixture of curiosity, disgust and feigned indifference crept upon the faces of the courtiers as they lined the carpet up to the emperor’s throne.\n\nThe three gnomes bowed upon reaching the throne's base and silently in unison moved aside. As the veil over the box was lifted,  gasps could be heard throughout the court.\n\nWithin the box lay a small bronze mechanical dragon, standing almost 2 feet tall. Its ruby eyes gleamed in the brightly lit hall as the sound of moving cogs began to sputter, each claw encrusted with refined jade. The mechanical creature began its routine.\n\n It walked approximately five paces out of its box, tilting its head to look around the room with an almost creature-like curiosity before tilting its head gently up into the sky, its mouth opening wide. A quiet roar emitted from it; a burst of flame erupted, causing nearby nobles to jump back in fright. Finally the mechanical dragon stretched its jaw wide as if to yawn and curled up in a ball, the whirring of the cogs growing faint as the court looked upon the throne. The Emperor sat still for a moment before nodding their head in acceptance; cries of celebration and applause echoed throughout the castle."

Today, three guild representatives of each faction and the Ravelian representative greet each other as individuals of a shared unified faith. The three representatives each bring a paper to [Root.Monarch.GetName], unanimously agreeing that the name Giberd - “Gift Earth” -  no longer represents the nation as it once did nearly a millennium ago. Giberd needs a new name to represent that this nation has fundamentally changed, in faith, in land and in identity; this Giberd and the old Giberd are leagues apart.\n\nFarmers draw bountiful harvests thanks to magically fortified crops; glassblowers haul their wares onto boats and sail assisted by powerful wind towers;  fabric weavers hone their craft under the caring watch of the River Guard.

 flavor_giberd.36.d:0 "Nothing good comes without a cost. This is true of many things in life, but it seems not even innovation is sacred, as the spendthrifts and merchants of Damescrown have sent a letter to the office of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] demanding that our precious and unique Wind Towers, which facilitate our trade across Esmaria, also be built in their nation, so as to ensure a ‘fair balance of trade’ which is of course, a thinly veiled attempt to maintain their trading strength."\n\n"Nevertheless, the harsh sanctions and economic might they wield means that ignoring them is absolutely not feasible for our nation’s prosperity - thus, the guilds have been assembled and three guilds have forged three solutions."\n\n"The Technomancers argue there’s no point not building the wind towers, saying they’ll figure them out eventually, and it keeps us on good terms. The Brillites argue that we should build the Wind Towers… and make sure they send every ship straight to Giberd. The Mechanists suggest simply shooting the Damescrownmen until they stop complaining."

 flavor_giberd.39.d:0 "When we opened the door to the Ravelians, none predicted just how many would flood into our realm, settling down and planting roots across various urban centres in Giberd. Now, they’ve been nothing but lovely neighbours, and their incredible scholarly knowledge has made many within the guilds ask if it would not be prudent to integrate them and their far reaching expertise into our government.\n\nThe only question on most minds is how much should they be integrated? This has quickly become a quite contentious issue, as some have grown more suspicious, or perhaps never grew to trust in the first place."\n\n"The Technomancers argue for a complete integration across all levels of government, with the good name of the Ravelians and their scholarly demeanour becoming synonymous with Giberd across Cannor."\n\n"The Brillites favour a more moderate approach, ensuring that whilst the Ravelians are welcome into government, they will always be secondary to the artificers."\n\n"The Mechanists, most paranoid of all, believe that any who join the Ravelians must be prohibited from joining guilds or growing too close to the apparatus of state."\n\n"Fortunately for us, these changes need not be permanent, and will likely fluctuate with elections to come."

 flavor_giberd.41.d:0 "Across the empire, in the hands of the wealthy, the powerful and the prestigious, letters arrived, delivered by jubilant gnomes and confused messengers alike. These pink-stained envelopes spoke of a world to come, a place of wonders and excitement  yet scarcely imagined, once more drawing the eyes of Cannor to the state of Giberd."\n\n"Lorren Silcas, a poet, artist and courtier, known in the realms of Cannor for his impeccable taste and fondness for wine, found himself wandering down the fine paved roads of Giberd, eyeing the massive hull that gently bobbed upon the Esmar’s water. Something resembling awe dawned on his face as he waited and watched for the opening hour, the busy swarm of artificers and engineers aboard the deck, either hard at work setting up the faire, or their stalls within it."\n\n"From gnomish engineering students, to Ravelian Holy Artificers and even the occasional dwarven craftsmen, the ship served as menagerie of the nation of Giberd, in all of its stripes and colours. Lorren could scarcely contain his eagerness at this point, spying wondrous clockwork beasts, suits to make a gnome as tall as a man and four times as strong, and a device that promised communication over a distance of miles!"\n\n"Wine wetted his appetite and curiosity as the seconds counted down, and in the turning of dusk came the roar of fireworks, blasting into the sky above, painting the darkness awash with radiance surely only spoken of previously in stories, blotting out the stars. Shapes coalesced, animated illusions playing out, welcoming him, welcoming them all, to the fair of a lifetime."

 flavor_giberd.42.d:0 "Lorren is instantly whisked away from the moment he steps upon that ramp until the moment he leaves. A crowd unlike any he’s seen floods onto the boat, making use of almost as much space as there is, enough to guarantee a crowd of ten- maybe twenty at every stall, and to busy every organiser and artificer upon that boat."\n\n"His eyes drift stern-faced Wexonard officers haggling and testing a suit of war, easily lifting boxes filled with heavy ore, to gnomes hovering off the ground with the aid of a damestear-powered flying machine, to a shield so effective that not even a point-blank blast from a firework leaves the- rather brave- Ravelian with so much as a singed hair."\n\n"Lorren himself finds himself standing and balancing upon a mechanism, whooping with joy as he leaps upon it and sails into the air above for a few moments - not very high, truly, but high enough to give him pause as he looks down upon the crowd, upon the faire. He has a distinct feeling that he is witnessing history, as primitive ‘memory-lights’ promise to store the moment for future generations and a crowd of thousands is awed by Giberdi talent and hospitality."\n\n"His eyes then drift to the crowded and proud podium, as a gnome shuffles up to speak into the equipment there, and the feeling in his heart tells him this will be a speech to remember."
 flavor_giberd.42.a:0 "Curious and excited, he leans in."

 flavor_giberd.43.t:0 "Giberd: a Nation Financed"
 flavor_giberd.43.d:0 "Lorren’s memories of the night aren’t too clear - the wine insured that - but enough lingers for him to talk about it often to his friends and family. A place of wondrous invention, and plenty of haggling. He watched devices and gold change hands with regularity, whilst investment deals were drafted upon a bobbing boat. As the hours went by he staggered from stall to stall, occasionally impressed enough to make his own purchases - though he has little idea now what to do with a mechanical sparrow."\n\n"The faire as he and the world would remember it was a massive commercial success; merchants have since poured  coin into the hands of the artificers, enough to fund their wildest experiments for years to come. In so doing, they have cemented artificery as a commercially viable part of life."\n\n"It is with grand speeches from the Brillites and optimism from the Technomancers that the night ends,  commemorating the successes of their people and toasting better days to come."
 flavor_giberd.43.a:0 "Pens and quills are the language of the scribe, and swords and guns the language of the warrior, but the truly successful speak with scales and coin."

 flavor_giberd.44.t:0 "Giberd: a Nation Friendless"
 flavor_giberd.44.d:0 "Lorren could tell there was something odd in the atmosphere from the second he walked upon that boat. At first, it was but a quaint feeling as he meandered the tech, engaging in the occasional quiet conversation with those who had some particularly impressive devices on display- gods know he was impressed by that flying mechanism with the rotors, it was like nothing he had ever seen."\n\n"But the feeling grew, until even the alcohol could not hide it from him, and a glance around told him why. The deck was nearly empty, stalls left unvisited but for a few other passing merchants and quaint sightseers. A vastly underwhelming turnout for such a wonderful affair. Something that was not lost on the gnomes."\n\n"A vast majority seemed either incredibly saddened, or smouldering with rage, but his attention did not go to them - instead it drifted back to a large and portly gnome, standing with a few other formal looking associates, who seemed nothing if not smug at this outcome. Vindicated, perhaps?"\n\n"Lorren felt the atmosphere shift as those lot went to talk to the others, the sadness growing more and more frenzied with anger, and in his wisdom, little as it was, he took the first chance to leave. Unbeknownst to him, the artificers upon that boat came to a harrowing and dark conclusion on that moonless night."

 flavor_giberd.45.t:0 "Giberd: a Nation Favoured"
 flavor_giberd.45.d:0 "The closing speech of the Technomancers comes not a moment too late, as the evening drags into the early morning. The future of Artificery in the Empire and indeed all Cannor has been grasped firmly within Giberdi hands for decades if not centuries to come.\n\n"My friends! My friends!" cries [Root.Monarch.GetName] "I must thank you all, all of you good chaps and ma’ams who came so far to our fair! To our humble city! To think that not even four hundred years ago, we were but a singular city and her lands, stifled at every turn, and with a hopeless cause. Our fathers and mothers must be proud that we have come so far, to know that we have done right by their dreams!"\n\n"Artificery is not a niche any more, it is a promise. A promise of better days to come, to see the challenges of the world defeated by places like this, by people like you all! Giberd is proud to stand at the edge of the future, and to welcome all of you unto better days with open arms!"\n\n"So let us celebrate! Let us thank you, as you have so thanked my friends and students, let us make merry, and let us find that future together.""
