 council_of_the_technocrats_desc:0 "The Council of the Technocrats is a special body of technocrats that can urge the overboss to direct funding as well as give them areas to work on their projects. This is the system that pissed off the continent as mages originally had a large power base in bulwar and their positions were being heavily threatened. The mage estate would most likely not even exist if this idea were to go through so it was seen from the old nobility that it must be stopped before it could grow leading to the slaughter of every non goblin within the goblinclan"

 Z8Z_an_annoying_island_claimed_desc:0 "Eborthil during our time of weakness decided to exploit that and while we can respect such a decision that would be the case if it didnt happen to us.

 Z8Z_developing_a_nations_lands_desc:0 "Bulwar was the first of great city states, well before cannor, and yet cannor has many more metropolises than bulwar.

 Z8Z_barracks_to_train_our_soldiers_desc:0 "Now that we have proper food production it is time to expand the training of our troops. While every province sends us some troops little of them are of use to us as they dont have proper locaitons to trian. The barracks will insure that our troops are well trained and capable of standing in our armies on the battlefield. It may also be about time to bring the humans back into the fold as they can work the fields for us and feed our armies in exchange for no longer being hunted across bulwar"
 Z8Z_an_expidition_party_to_explore_the_caves_title:0 "An expidition party to explore the caves"
 Z8Z_an_expidition_party_to_explore_the_caves_desc:0 "The caves is where all goblins once were before the greentide. When the dwarovar was still under the control of the dwarves the goblins hid in its caves. The greentide brought upon goblins slavery and massacre that not even the hold of Haraz Orldhum could muster. The straggler goblins in bulwar were a remnant of goblins that escaped from these caves and prehaps now that the greentide is long over it is time to reclaim our homes"
 Z8Z_a_hold_reclaimed_title:0 "A hold reclaimed"
 Z8Z_a_hold_reclaimed_desc:0 "The first step to reclaiming our caves is complete. The hold of Shazstundihr has been reclaimed. It was home to the marble dwarves which build many marble works. They however are no more and it is well time that the goblins reclaim this hold"

 Z8Z_securing_the_mountainside_title:0 "Securing the mountainside"
 Z8Z_securing_the_mountainside_desc:0 "Now it is time to deal with those pesky dwarves.

 Z8Z_two_problems_one_stone_title:0 "Two problems one stone"
 Z8Z_two_problems_one_stone_desc:0 "The dwarves never really played a large role against the goblins in the war against the goblins but they did play a big part in subjugating the goblins long ago. There are old wounds that hadnt fully healed yet and while the government may be able to find a job for these dwarves the people would never allow it. So we shall have one final decisive act that will forever show goblin dominance over the dwarves. Once all the dwarves are dealt with we will send them to castles that they can rebuild with dwarven foritifications and ensure that the walls dont fall nearly as easily without dwarven help. In return they wont be hunted anymore as long as they stay in these cities"

 Z8Z_joining_with_the_international_gommo_desc:0 "The artificers are always going to be a major part of the government in the goblinclan. So the only question we have is how do we want to use them to the best abilities. The main idea we have is working with the international gommo. While they are generally not as loyal they may be too scared to act if they were to decide anything against the state. The massive amount of lands we own as well as the willingness to share our discoveries with the gommo will also ensure that they wont ever want to break from this deal."
 Z8Z_fortify_the_west_title:0 "Fortify the west"
 Z8Z_fortify_the_west_desc:0 "The fortress of bal ouord has long been a well defended structure between the ocean and the serpentspine. We should look to building up our defenses here just in case of an invasion, building them high enough that no army would dare attack the fort"
 Z8Z_the_northern_passes_into_the_heartland_title:0 "The northern passes into the heartland"
 Z8Z_the_northern_passes_into_the_heartland_desc:0 "The northern lands were the first lands conquered by the goblins. They have a mountain on one side and the ocean on the other making it extremely difficult to invade through, we should use these small corridors to heavily defend it from any invasion and then build special goblin ambush sites to allow it to be more difficult than usual to besiege our fortresses"
 Z8Z_defending_the_salahad_gate_title:0 "Defending the salahad gate"
 Z8Z_defending_the_salahad_gate_desc:0 "While there is no true gate in the salahad the distance between the navigateable lands and ocean is very thin here. So thin you can hardly march an army through it without it turning into a bottleneck. Going slightly too far south you will end up in a desert wasteland spending the rest of your life trying to find a way back to civilization. This makes a very good oppertunity to defend the gate here and also defend the mountains behind it just in case so that we can always keep our lands safe."
 Z8Z_the_final_bulwark_title:0 "The final bulwark"
 Z8Z_the_final_bulwark_desc:0 "The lands of sareyand are filled with almost all of the grasslands and farmlands in bulwar. While this is for the most part a massive boon it also makes us run into some issues in defending such a place. Without cotnrolling the endless desert placing fortifications around here is extremely difficult so we must isntead do what we can and hope for the best. While this will keep the heartland secure it will mean that we should try to avoid fighting in the east"
 Z8Z_batteries_to_defend_our_coast_title:0 "Batteries to defend our coast"
 Z8Z_batteries_to_defend_our_coast_desc:0 "While our navy may not be the best we can look to keeping our lands safe with naval batteries. This will ensure that while we can be blockaded that any long term blockade will end with the sinking of many of their ships if they cannot land and take our batteries. If they try to take them thats where our superior army will take their turn in the war and slaughter them in the shores. Currently we dont have the money to make all these defenses but it will be a start"
 Z8Z_a_navy_for_offence_title:0 "A navy for offence"
 Z8Z_a_navy_for_offence_desc:0 "Now that we have a semi defended coastline we should now look towards having a decent navy. With a decent navy we can chase down their ships after they have taken enough damage from our coastal batteries. Hopefully when we catch the ships we will be able to sink enough of them to gain some kind of naval dominance so that we can push our infantry advantage against our enemies"
 Z8Z_a_coast_defended_title:0 "A coast defended"
 Z8Z_a_coast_defended_desc:0 "Now that we have a decent navy we can look to ensuring that there is no safety in the waters if you are our enemy.

 Z8Z_keeping_bulwar_heritage_strong_desc:0 "While we conquer bulwar it is important that we rebuild these things that we destroy.

 Z8Z_a_glorious_project_title:0 "A glorious project"
 Z8Z_a_glorious_project_desc:0 "We must do much more than just maintain these structures we should do everything we can to ensure that they are also well taken care of and even expanded upon when we understand them properly. Only once we prove that we can rebuild bulwar better than before will people trust our claim to this land"
 Z8Z_a_place_for_work_title:0 "A place for work"
 Z8Z_a_place_for_work_desc:0 "It is important that we build up our economy and keep the goblins that arent in the army busy. To do this we will build manufactories on all the provinces that we can and give the goblins work to do. This will solve both of our problems quickly"
 Z8Z_allowing_elves_into_the_fold_title:0 "Allowing elves into the fold"
 Z8Z_allowing_elves_into_the_fold_desc:0 "The past 10 years have shown one thing to the goblins working in the manufactories and that is that work sucks. If only we had a fringe population of some kind that may be willing to do the work for us instead of being hunted across our lands whenever we find them. Perhaps it is time to bring the elves back into our ranks"
 Z8Z_pesky_remnants_removed_title:0 "Pesky remnants removed"
 Z8Z_pesky_remnants_removed_desc:0 "The mages have been the heart of many problems in our nation.

It is time we bring this institution to an end"

 Z8Z_eranils_oddities_explored_desc:0 "Eranil's oddities store has been here as long as the elves. It is a wonderful store having both everything and nothing at the same time. It isn't even in the same place every time we see it. After years of researching it we can understand how it works and use it to our advantage"
 Z8Z_a_proper_economic_policy_title:0 "A proper economics policy"
 Z8Z_a_proper_economic_policy_desc:0 "Depending on tax income is the old way of life as well as the dependance on gold. There just isnt enough gold in bulwar to fill our coffers and we killed enough people to drop our tax income through a ditch. The only way we can reliably make money now is through producing our goods. So we will now start producing and then selling just about everything we can get our hands on to fix our economy"
 Z8Z_gathering_artificery_knowledge_title:0 "Gathering Artificery knowledge"
 Z8Z_gathering_artificery_knowledge_desc:0 "Now that we have secured the artificers it is time for them to produce results. It will be important to have artificer inventions flooding through bulwar as fast as possible to make up for how much the region has unfortunately declined under our rule"

 Z8Z_accepting_of_people_desc:0 "There perhaps was a bit of a hiccup at the formation of our country with the people living here but now after much deliberation and reconstruction we have decided that it would be best for us to being all these people back under our control instead of having them live in hiding where they are killed if they are caught"
 Z8Z_a_fixed_government_title:0 "A fixed government"
 Z8Z_a_fixed_government_desc:0 "We have been informed that perhaps having the technocrats control so much of our country may have been a bad idea. They still shall hold the ear of the overboss but they will lose their control over the provinces themselves and isntead get their income from their share of the land like every other estate. They will still of course be treated better than the rest that is a given its just that now the overboss will have 100% control of the provinces"

 Z8Z_animals_with_a_similar_goal_mission_desc:0 "if the country hasnt been able to get the gnollish religion cult then it will get it, otherwise you will be able to start a demonic party which will increase morale by 10% but also all provinces will gain devistation"

 flavor_goblinclan.1.d:0 "the decisions of the overboss to replace the honourary positions of the mages, who had clearly proven their worth in the eyes of the population, with those of the technocrats, who are new and hardly have anything to show for themselves. They have marched an army to aquatbar to free themselves from our rule. They are a mix of all the peoples of bulwar and they shall be crushed. We did everything we could for these people and they betray us like this? no, this cannot  stand. We will kill this army and the next one and the next one until we get to their homes and burn them out of our country by force. They dont want to live by our rules then we have a rather direct solution for them"
 flavor_goblinclan.1.a:0 "We will burn them out if we have to"
 
 flavor_goblinclan.2.t:0 "The War Against Goblins Has Ended!"
 flavor_goblinclan.2.d:0 "It is finally over. The country is in ruins, the armies exhausted, the countryside ransacked, and the cities burnt. We will need to rebuild in time but first we need to look towards our army to keep us safe"

 flavor_goblinclan.3.t:0 "The War is Taking Too Long"
 flavor_goblinclan.3.d:0 "The war is taking much too long for those living under our rule. Rooting out the peoples of bulwar has proven more difficult than expected and the people are wondering if a new clanboss could fix things? We must hurry before they put their thoughts into actions"
 flavor_goblinclan.3.a:0 "We must hurry"

 flavor_goblinclan.4.t:0 "The Armies are Exhausted"
 flavor_goblinclan.4.d:0 "The armies have gone across bulwar multiple times over without break. They have battled in almost every province multiple times over and the end is nowhere near in sight. Men are deserting and morale is low"
 flavor_goblinclan.4.a:0 "The army must be reinvigorated"

 flavor_goblinclan.5.t:0 "Hidden humans request re-entry for work"
 flavor_goblinclan.5.d:0 "Humans hiding away from our patrols have sent us a hidden message to try and rejoin society in return for work. We could either accept this and this will allow more goblins to be free to do what they want or we can continue with our current practices"

 flavor_goblinclan.5.b:0 "We are quite happy with the status quo"

 flavor_goblinclan.6.t:0 "Too many goblins"
 flavor_goblinclan.6.d:0 "With the introduction of all the support for building up our military we have unfortunately run into the same issue as earlier where we have far too many men and not enough capital to pay for them. This leads us to having 2 answers for this, either we accept them all anyways and just deal wih it later or we can only accept the absolute best of the best"
 flavor_goblinclan.6.a:0 "You can never have too many goblins"
 flavor_goblinclan.6.b:0 "Only accept the best of the best"

 flavor_goblinclan.7.d:0 "There have been some Elisnan ships spotted off of our coasts. We dont know where they will land but we do know their targets are our strongholds. They will rile up the population and then move to the stronghold. We have 2 choices in dealing with this. Either we can kill them on the shores or let them try and siege our castles and surround them. If we let them siege our castles however they will be able to gather more men from the countryside to help them"

 flavor_goblinclan.8.t:0 "Revolts brought up by our people"
 flavor_goblinclan.8.d:0 "The purged populations are getting ippity again. They have started a revolt in one of their insignificant towns. It is about time that we burn them out and thankfully they have shown exactly where the rats are hiding"
 flavor_goblinclan.8.a:0 "Burn them out"

 flavor_goblinclan.9.t:0 "Fight them on the shores!"
 flavor_goblinclan.9.d:0 "We have decided to fight them on the shores before they can gather a larger army. We must be quick though before they can capture the town and head towards the castle"
 flavor_goblinclan.9.a:0 "Lets remove them before they become a problem"

 flavor_goblinclan.10.t:0 "Surround them at the gates!"
 flavor_goblinclan.10.d:0 "We have let them gather but also set up a proper defensive area that we will defend our lands from. It is time for us to remove this cancer before it grows further"
 flavor_goblinclan.10.a:0 "Surround them before they finish the siege"

 flavor_goblinclan.11.t:0 "Goblins ready to join the fight!"
 flavor_goblinclan.11.d:0 "With the war against goblins it has split some goblins wanting to help their old friends and some want to ensure a purely goblin state. It appears something has happened behind the scenes leading to more goblins ready to join the fight!"
 flavor_goblinclan.11.a:0 "It is time to strike!"
 
 flavor_goblinclan.12.t:0 "Outer community hates us"
 flavor_goblinclan.12.d:0 "With the end of the war against the goblins the outer community has seen us massacre every population to win the war and apparently they dont like that. Pretty much all domestic planning has failed and we are plans to oust the overboss. We have thankfully however thought of a fantastic new system of government to ensure that going forward only goblins will succeed in this nation"
 flavor_goblinclan.12.a:0 "For the Goblinclan!"
