 flavor_fadhevych.0.d:0 "Recently the balance of power in our corner of the Ynn was upset when the upstart Lord of Trompolere, Alaran yen Cestor, engaged in a war of conquest against the lords of Sarda. At Vels Cestor, Alaran managed to achieve a shocking victory against our forces, forcing our hand as we ceded some of our territory to him and swore not to interfere in his conquests. A choice which proved wise, as Arverynn's army was entirely crushed by Alaran at the battle of Les Vethrany, a kind of loss which our lordship, as a bulwark against Veykoda, simply cannot afford.\n\nThe victorious Alaran even managed to crush the host of Stanyrhrada which had tried to intercept his march; arriving victorious Arverynn's gates, he forced Calrodiy IV to offer him much of his imperial coffers to redirect his conquests elsewhere. The lordship of Trompolere also acquired wide swathes of land from its neighbours, ourselves included. While we certainly didn't get the worst of this defeat, our armies still suffered damage that will take some time to recover from.\n\nAs for Alaran, rumour has it he's planning his next campaign right now, if his own troops don't murder him first to end his incessant warring!"
