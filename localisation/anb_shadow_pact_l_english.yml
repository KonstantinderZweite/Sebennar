 shadow_pact:0 "Shadow Pact"
 shadow_pact_religion_desc:0 "The Shadow Pact represents a wide range of beliefs and practices that venerate the powerful beings of the Shadow Plane. Its followers believe that their souls go to the Shadow Plane after their demise, and so seek to gain favor with the powerful beings of that plane in order to have a better afterlife for both themselves and their loved ones. The practices and teachings of the Shadow Pact vary widely depending on the region its practicioners are from. These beliefs are all united around the concept that nothing is free in this reality, and that to receive a blessing, something must be sacrificed."

 ###events

 shadow_pact.3.t:0 "Reading the Portents"
 shadow_pact.3.d:0 "Long shadows stretch from candles in a dark and private chamber, as [Root.Monarch.GetName] watches the arrangement of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] portents. The process has been meticulous, as befits the destiny of a [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]; hours of rituals, readings, and incantations have already passed... eagerness mixes with nervousness, as the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s eyes meet those of their fortune teller.\n\nWith this reading, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] fate is now sealed.\n\n[Root.ShadowPactFirstPortent]\n\n[Root.ShadowPactSecondPortent]\n\n[Root.ShadowPactThirdPortent]"
 shadow_pact.3.a:0 "Then let this be my fate."

 shadow_pact_sorcerer_ritual_adm:0 "The first portent is a dirty, wrinkled scroll, made of animal skin and bound with a tie of matching sinew. [Root.Monarch.GetName] slew the beast with [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] own hands.\n\n"The Sorcerer! The master of learning, delving into arcane knowledge deeper than any man before him. Knowledge has always been your greatest ally. Each page you turn, each ledger you sign—all have been steps closer to the final truth. But take heed; every decision you make is constrained by your past choices. I only hope they were informed ones.""
 shadow_pact_sorcerer_ritual_dip:0 "The second portent is a withered tree root, blackened with rot and teeming with worms. Strangely, it smells strongly of iron—the same scent that led [Root.Monarch.GetName] to its location in the first place.\n\n"The Sorcerer! A weaver of illusions, a plucker of threads in the world’s tapestry. But beware; bonds forged of camaraderie can also be paths for unwelcome passengers. A shared cup. A stolen kiss. As you prepare for the enemies without, take care not to forget the ones within…""
 shadow_pact_sorcerer_ritual_mil:0 "The final portent is a handful of glittering ash, soot, and salt, shimmering in the dim light like a pile of stardust. The fortune teller casts it into the air, and it expands to fill the room from corner to corner.\n\n"The Sorcerer! Lord of all things mystical! The sensational! The legendary! And of course, the illusive, and the mysterious… Signs will surround you, hidden from sight, cloaked in smoke and shadows. Intuition, perception, and a little magic of your own will be your guides—now you see it, now you don’t. Blink and you’ll miss it! You wouldn’t want to miss it.""

 shadow_pact_wraith_ritual_adm:0 "The first portent is a collection of stones, drawn blindly from a bag. They are each of a glassy, dark obsidian, save for two starkly white stones that seem almost like eyes amidst the darkness.\n\n"Ahhh... sweet regret. The Wraith haunts your past, whispering of desires unfulfilled. Perhaps it is something you did, or perhaps something you wish you had done. Find wisdom and courage in your regrets, for though they are your past they need not be your future.""
 shadow_pact_wraith_ritual_dip:0 "The next portent is a shifting pattern of foam, formed from boiling drops of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s blood in water. It has formed a ghostly, weeping, face.\n\n"The Wraith dogs your step, its cold hand reaching for your heart. Perhaps there is something you desire, that eludes your grasp? Or perhaps the wraith inhabits one who desires what is yours. Cherish the life you have now, that is what the Wraith seeks. For it is dead, and you are living.""
 shadow_pact_wraith_ritual_mil:0 "The final portent is a scorched wooden bowl filled with animal bones. The bones are arranged in humanoid shape, with the scorch mark forming an uncanny shadow behind them.\n\n"The Wraith hangs over your future, like a dreadful cloud. You will know loss, disappointment, and regret, in the twilight of your life. But do not let the fear of regret prevent you from living now, for the truest sorrow is to have never had anything to lose at all.""

 shadow_pact_three_urns_ritual_adm:0 "The first portent is a collection of stones, drawn blindly from a bag. The first one drawn is a petrified rock, with cracks splitting it in three.\n\n"The three urns! Your past has shown great restraint, your cups filled to the brim with molten gold. Saved for a dark day you waited as long as you could before tasting its sweet reward. Take care not to let your wine turn to vile vinegar.""
 shadow_pact_three_urns_ritual_dip:0 "The next portent is a stone smashed with a hammer, broken into three pieces.\n\n"The three urns! patient you have toiled and worked for your reward, wipe the sweat of your brow and accept the bountiful harvests. Do not dally for your crops may wither and rot in your palms.""
 shadow_pact_three_urns_ritual_mil:0 "The final portent is interrupted by the heavy thunderstorm outside the tent, lightning strikes three times in quick succession.\n\n"The three urns! It is imperative you wait for the right moment my get-ruler-title to collect the reward due. every storm has a silver lining, all we need to do is wait for the clouds to part to seize the opportunity.""

 shadow_pact_silat_ritual_adm:0 "The first portent is a collection of stones, drawn blindly from a bag. The first one drawn is a large ruby, red with fiery passion.\n\n"The Silat! spirit and drive absorbed your past. Many a moon was spent engrossed dreaming of someone or something you enjoyed. Like the Silat in their isolated palace you watched from afar, unable to grasp that which you obsessed over. beware your future does not melt away in idle longing.""
 shadow_pact_silat_ritual_dip:0 "The next portent is a stone smashed with a hammer, the dust forming a red-orange eerie smoke reflected in the flickering candlelight.\n\n"The Silat! Your obsession will be your downfall!" The soothsayer recoils and quickly mutters\n\n“I'm sorry, i didn’t mea-” You handwave their rashness and let them continue.\n"Whatever it may be that has your focus, beware that it does not blind you to peripheral danger.""
 shadow_pact_silat_ritual_mil:0 "The final portent is powder thrown into a smoldering flame, the sparks and smoke swell to form a frightening visage of a shadowy figure.\n\n"The Silat! From beyond the realm of shadow a powerful being has taken an interest in you. For good or ill they will observe your every move, avoid their ire and perhaps you will be rewarded in the near future."\n\nAs the soothsayer finishes a puff of smoke billows out of the fire.\n\n"Ah, and beware the envy of others""

 shadow_pact_tree_ritual_adm:0 "The first portent is a reading of innards, some pestilent beast lays open and leaking. In the black oozes swelling from its inside strange oily streaks form images.\n\n"Ah, the tree. It has grown in your past, nurtured by adversity. You have overcome much, but the branches of the tree are still casting their shadow on you now. The tree cannot be cut down but it can be choked. Overcome once more what you have before." The images in the innards seem to have dissolved, the black ooze nothing more than a disgusting mess now. But you could swear the dead beast's eyes were staring at you."
 shadow_pact_tree_ritual_dip:0 "The next portent is a crooked little root pulled from a bag of stones.\nFirst confusion then shock flashes over the Seers face.\n\n"No! That is not supposed to be in there!" she hisses.\n"The tree, omen of a higher power watching. They seek to disturb what I am doing, bring down what you have tried to build. Powerful enemies from beyond are watching you. Prepare for adversity, ahead you have enemies not to be trifled with."" 

 shadow_pact_tree_ritual_mil:0 "The last portent is a reading of tea leaves, drunk from an uneven cup. It tastes bitter and foul. You feel sick from the smell alone.\n\n"Ah, the tree, bringer of disease. Great peril lies before you. Rot will sweep the land and it will lay fallow." She stirs the grounds once more.\n"Yes! Pestilence! It is clear. In your own house a sickness will spread. Beware!" The Seer cries out, her hands shakingly holding the cup."

 shadow_pact_flame_ritual_adm:0 "The first portent is a candle of black wax. The fortune teller sets it alight, and the smoke from its wick turns the colour of cobalt.\n\n"Hope, that old Flame. A beacon: a guide that pierces the gloom. Perhaps there was a moment when all seemed lost. Even then, a spark of hope remained, refusing to be extinguished. This is that moment—that glimmer of faith that refused to die. Keep moving forward, just as you did back then. Let Hope guide your steps. The Flame may have been small, but it was enough.""
 shadow_pact_flame_ritual_dip:0 "The second portent is a bundle of dried grass, speckled with pollen and loose petals. As the fortune teller lifts it, it begins to smoke in the their hands.\n\n"Hope. A warming fire—a promise of peace. You find yourself near the hearth, and the burning flames inside. Respite. A moment, now, to gather your strength. A time for comfort. But take care not to get complacent, for the fire always needs tending. Cherish the light you have. Try to keep it burning.""
 shadow_pact_flame_ritual_mil:0 "The final portent is a red-hot coal, gripped in the fortune teller’s hand as if it were nothing more than an inert stone. It trembles against their skin, tiny cracks beginning to cross its surface.\n\n"Ah, the Flame. A brighter future, but only a fool would blindly follow torchlight in the dark. We all know a fool when we see one, don’t we? The assurance of success inspires recklessness. Spontaneity. Thoughtless acts... But this is a game played with fire, and the consequences match. So think. Think, and you might not get burned.""

 
 shadow_pact_flayed_man_ritual_adm:0 "The first portent is a simple image drawn onto dusty paper. A man with no skin, his insides all visible in excruciating detail and gore under [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s gaze.\n\n"It’s not a nice sight, is it? That’s what most will agree. But there are countless images of such people in countless books. For each so drawn, a scribe has spent hours upon the beauty of the detail of such a man, studying, learning, enjoying…"""
 shadow_pact_flayed_man_ritual_dip:0 "The next portent is a piece of inner flesh. It is thick and hardened and yet warm upon touch; you can still feel the vigor within it.\n\n"Many are afraid of it. Have you ever seen the image of a flayed man? Study it and learn that such a man has no weaknesses; everyone can see him, yet he suffers no longer the weakness of flesh. Instead, he knows the strength beneath our skin.""
 shadow_pact_flayed_man_ritual_mil:0 "The final portent is a skinning knife. A tool once used on animals is now laid bare in front of [Root.Monarch.GetName].\n\n"Take it. You know what to do with it and the meaning behind it. After you are done you will no longer fear or waste your energy hiding your weaknesses. You will skin them away ‘til only strength and resilience is left behind.""

 shadow_pact_meteor_ritual_adm:0 "The first portent is taken from a bag filled with stones, a tiny shard of a glowing rock, filling the room with a light blue glow. Damestear.\n\n"Damestear… the rarest metal, that which comes from the skies. The Meteor shows you were destined for greatness. Perhaps there was a great burden placed on your shoulders from a young age, or your fate was set in stone. Learn from this past destiny to ensure your future does not reflect it.""
 shadow_pact_meteor_ritual_dip:0 "As the next portent is being prepared, you see a light streaking across the sky. The fortune teller's face curls into a twisted smile, their rotting teeth shining in the wake of cosmic light.\n\n"This is one of the clearest signs I have ever seen. The Meteor lights up your present.  Like this meteor, your present brings the potential of greatness, but also the possibility of an impending tragedy. I can’t wait to see what will befall you.""
 shadow_pact_meteor_ritual_mil:0 "The final portent is a piece of paper. The fortune teller splashes ink all over the paper. They tell you to look at the ink and describe to them what you see.[Root.ShadowPactHeir]\n\n"You’re worried about the future of your country, are you not? Will it all be for nothing after you pass on? The Meteor is shining in the distance, holding an uncertain future. While it’s understandable to worry, know that your country’s fate will be in good hands.""

 shadow_pact_tyrant_ritual_adm:0 "The first portent is a voodoo doll brought out of the choosing bag, it wears a viney crown and has a singular needle piercing it’s back.\n\n"The Tyrant! Those stronger than you have used their power to keep you down in your youth. Perhaps a cruel teacher, or abusive parent. You know what it is like to be beneath someone's foot. Remember that retribution is not to be doled out on the innocent, lest they grow to resent you.""
 shadow_pact_tyrant_ritual_dip:0 "The next portent is a stuffed hare, a paw missing.\n\n"The Tyrant! Tormentor of the innocent, maker of chains and subject of ire. The people see you as their wicked overlord, in dark corners unsavory figures whisper of their plots and plans to rise against you, prepare for the worst.""
 shadow_pact_tyrant_ritual_mil:0 "The final portent is a fool's crown, the bells are missing.\n\n"The Tyrant! It will come a day when you must make a decision with no clear answer, the outcome will bear great ire towards you. Whichever path you choose, someone will call you a fool and despot, stay firm in your conviction.""

 shadow_pact_sleeper_ritual_adm:0 "The first portent arrives pleasantly enough, as the fortuneteller tosses a handful of seeds before a rooster. The animal thinks a second, then slowly, deliberately picks one. The diviner smiles.\n\n"Ah, the gray desolation of sleep. Your past is one of ever-shifting dreams, but when one lies in sleep, the stars dance above. You have not slept for long, but still a great change occurred, gradual but radical. Perhaps a new idea, or a shift in the world around.""
 shadow_pact_sleeper_ritual_dip:0 "The second portent reveals itself through roaring flames. As a bundle of herbs burns to ashes in the fire, an old woman intently studies the smoke that slowly shifts and folds.\n\n"The shadows dream of you, my lord,” she finally says. “The calm of night envelops you, but mistake it not for stillness. A great shift is happening, a time of new thought, perhaps, and you mustn’t let it pass you by. The time has come to wake.""
 shadow_pact_sleeper_ritual_mil:0 "The final portent comes at the tip of a blade, dripping fresh blood. A bull’s corpse lies before the seer, sliced open by [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s own hand. In shifting candle flame the animal's guts look almost like a person in fetal position.\n\n"The call of Shadow’s sleeping home, it would seem. As dreams always change, so does the future, and your future more so than ever is one of flux. A metamorphosis is coming, and you must prepare for it, lest you be swallowed by the shifting tide.""

 shadow_pact_burden_ritual_adm:0 "The first portent is a collection of stones, drawn blindly from a bag. Nothing seems special about them at first, but when weighed against the stones remaining in the bag they are heavier than them all combined.\n\n"You have carried the Burden before, learned from its harsh lessons and grown strong under its weight. Forgive me for imparting a final lesson. Those past burdens you still carry, cast them off or find others to help you carry them.""
 shadow_pact_burden_ritual_dip:0 "The next portent comes from the entrails of beasts hunted, slaughtered, or found dead, this very day. The fortune teller runs their thumb across a particularly bloated esophagus, and squeezes out a fist sized rock.\n\n"They could not bear the Burden... But you might yet survive it. In the present, a great weight is upon you. Perhaps you bear it willingly, perhaps it was forced on you. But remember, you need not bear it alone.""
 shadow_pact_burden_ritual_mil:0 "The final portent is a recording of a vision seen in smoke. Hours ago, the fortune teller had instructed [Root.Monarch.GetName] to breathe deeply with their head shrouded in smoke. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] had a vision of the ceiling caving in, burying [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] alive.\n\n"The Burden looms over your future, an ill omen. But there is yet time to ensure that, when the burden comes, you are strong enough to carry it. Remember, that strength need not come from you alone.""

 shadow_pact_time_ritual_adm:0 "The first portent is a small childs shoe, one worn by [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim].\n\n"Time! the memory of times past is clear as day to you, childhood memories and nostalgia fill your mind as you think back to better days, don’t let the past cloud your future and blind you to here and now.""
 shadow_pact_time_ritual_dip:0 "The next portent is a sundial, useless for the foggy and cloudy weather outside.\n\n"Ahh Time itself! the past and future converge, ever moving forward you risk losing yourself to the nostalgia of the past or the uncertainty of the future, continue your journey through these foggy days and one day you will reach your final destination, but that time will not be today.""
 shadow_pact_time_ritual_mil:0 "The final portent is a old used candle, it’s wick dark and damp.\n\n"The Ravages of Time! we all grow old and frail, slowly it crawls towards us. Birth is a promise; death is fulfillment, but you… perhaps you can stave off your destiny, for a time…""

 shadow_pact_defiant_ritual_adm:0 "The first portent is a now still cup of once-boiling water and the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s blood. The blood floats defiant on the surface, heedless of the state of the water.\n\n"Fire must seem a trifling thing, when the Defiant once burned in your blood. Your past is one of courage, perhaps small or perhaps grand. When it truly mattered, you stood for your beliefs. That fire is still in you, ready to ignite again... Be careful what you choose to burn.""
 shadow_pact_defiant_ritual_dip:0 "The next portent requires nothing but the two already present. The fortune teller searches the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s eyes, searching for something they had seen in the many rituals prior. When they find it, they seem almost... Startled.\n\n"... Do you have many enemies? Forgive me - I forget myself, my [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. The Defiant has marked you for glory, and whatever you face will find your courage unequaled. But be careful, the whole world need not be your foe.""
 shadow_pact_defiant_ritual_mil:0 "The final portent is a folded sheet of parchment, pressed with ink by the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s own hand. The ink has since dried, and as the parchment is unfolded it reveals the shape of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] hand exactly.\n\n"Ah. The Defiant often... chafes against these sorts of readings. What greater power is there to defy than destiny itself? Your future will be one of your own making, the challenges you face overcome by your will. But remember, you need not face them alone.""

 shadow_pact_madness_ritual_adm:0 "The first portent is a swirling pattern of solidified wax, formed as it dripped from a candle into cold water. It is hard to see any shape in it, let alone any meaning.\n\n"The signs of the everdancer are not easily understood,"explains the diviner, "but they mark your past in abundance. They tell a story of freedom and chance. Of risks taken - too easily, perhaps? Regardless, that mad time is over, and consequences might now reveal themselves""
 shadow_pact_madness_ritual_dip:0 "The second portent comes as dice, thrown by the seer’s hand. They dance on the table, as if unwilling to settle. One rolls off, but is not to be picked up. Finally, they stop.\n\n"So unruly, so chaotic, are they not?” The seer asks, pointing out their positions "The grip of the Madness on you is strong. You embrace freedom and uncertainty, perhaps you sniff at unfavourable odds. But if one gambles too much, loss may become an inevitability. Be careful.""
 shadow_pact_madness_ritual_mil:0 "The last portent is one of tea leaves, left in a cup. The brew was strong, unpleasantly so, but the fortune-teller said it did not matter. Now, she studies the swirling pattern intently. Suddenly, she starts whistling.\n\n"Hear, oh hear, the Madman’s tune. But you hear it already, do you not? Your future sings it also. It sings of such unrestrained freedom. Of liberty in risk. Oh, what is to come for you is pure chance and instinct. Utilise it well. There is so much to win – or to lose.""

 shadow_pact_golem_ritual_adm:0 "The first portent is a folded sheet of parchment, pressed with ink by the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s own hand. The ink has since dried, and as the parchment is unfolded it reveals the shape of a hammer.\n\n"The Golem has marked your past. No structure can stand on a bed of sand, and it seems your foundations were shaped by a firm hand. Trust in their strength, stand tall and proud. But remember to look beyond your foundation, lest it become a cage.""
 shadow_pact_golem_ritual_dip:0 "The next portent is a scorched wooden bowl, containing a single ashen bone. Where one might have expected it to shatter under the heat, its surface is hard and smooth. The fortune teller snaps it in half with surprising ease.\n\n"The Golem favors you, in the present. You are strong and solid, not easily moved or changed by the outside world. That which you build will be strong too... But beware, what doesn't bend may sometimes break.""
 shadow_pact_golem_ritual_mil:0 "The final portent is a collection of stones, drawn blindly from a bag. They have been pressed together, each one fitting like a puzzle piece, to construct a perfectly formed stone brick.\n\n"The Golem, it seems, favors your future. Your hands will shape this world of clay, and see it hardened and tempered. But be careful of what you choose to build, for it will stand firm against change. For good, or for ill.""

 shadow_pact_vulture_ritual_adm:0 "The first portent is a single feather and a pile of bones. Whose? Animals, a rival, a loyal subject of yours: it does not matter. The only thing that matters is that the remains come from a stripped carcass, of one [Root.Monarch.GetName] met in the past.\n\n"The vulture is an opportunist with keen eyes, who scours through the world for weaknesses. Its eyes are upon you. Will you be its hunter or its prey? Heed its sign.""
 shadow_pact_vulture_ritual_dip:0 "The next portent is a vulture beak and its talons, removed long ago. Despite their age and a fine patina of dust,  they are still sharp enough to pierce skulls and bones.\n\n"The vulture itself is not a strong being; it is not made to fight others. Its strength lies in its talent for spotting the weaknesses of others. It is not an uncommon sight to see the vulture leading hunters towards potential prey. Seek their sign.""
 shadow_pact_vulture_ritual_mil:0 "The final portent is the Vulture's skull, stripped of its beak. Perfectly preserved, skinned by a hungry kin: a warning for others.\n\n"It waits for you, [Root.Monarch.GetName]. Use its wisdom and a future will lie ahead of you in which the wings of your nation cast a shadow upon the world. You will reap rewards from the weak: Bear their sign""

 shadow_pact_mother_ritual_adm:0 "The first portent is a handkerchief, crumpled and stained from the tears it wiped over many years. The fortune teller weeps for a moment, using the handkerchief once again.\n\n"Your presence has radiated with love and hope that shifted many journeys from a perilous course. Many of your people owe  their lives to your kindness, and most would sacrifice themselves to protect it. As their parent, it is your responsibility to keep them safe and protect them from peril. But be careful to not lose yourself among those who need you.""
 shadow_pact_mother_ritual_dip:0 "The middle portent is a clay figure, vaguely human, yet its features are blurry, as if the artist wasn’t sure which expression it should bear."There is someone who looks up to you. Your actions are their guide, your words are their tenets. It is up to you to guide their story. As malleable as clay in the beginning, with time their shape will harden and resist your efforts to change it further. Invest in them and they shall profit you in the future. Neglect them and they will be your undoing sooner than you expect.""
 shadow_pact_mother_ritual_mil:0 "The final portent is a pot. The fortune teller plants his seeds into the pot, watering it and placing it on the windowsill, letting it bathe in moonlight."Each new life begins with sacrifice and relies on reward to keep going. Time and energy are spent to live, yet it can be cut short with one fatal strike. You have to learn to cherish life and protect it with every ounce of your being, otherwise you may be the first to wither and leave this plane prematurely.""
