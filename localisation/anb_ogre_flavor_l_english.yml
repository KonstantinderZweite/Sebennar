 feast_of_the_gods_reform_1_desc:0 "In order to wean our people off from wanton cannibalism, we must first heavily invest into our food production. Combined with a strict system of quotas, price adjustments, and compelled labor, we should be able to produce enough food to keep our people (relatively) happy and fed."
 
 feast_of_the_gods_reform_2:0 "Funerary Cannibalism"
 feast_of_the_gods_reform_2_desc:0 "Cannibalism as a concept is far too ingrained into our culture and beliefs for its complete abolition to be utterly inconsiderable. Instead, we must codify the appropriate time and place for consuming the flesh of others. This should also have the welcome side effect of ensuring that the soul of a ruler is passed down to their heir, limiting the ability of pretenders to press their claims."

 feast_of_the_gods_reform_3:0 "Abolish the Flesh Tithe"
 feast_of_the_gods_reform_3_desc:0 "Throughout our history, we have been painted as villains for our practice of forgiving unpaid debts in exchange for the flesh of our clients. Abolishing this tradition may harm us in the short term, but in the long run will do wonders for our public image. Besides, any who bend to knee to us will still be aware of what we’re capable of, and should be much more willing to cooperate with our demands."

 feast_of_the_gods_reform_4:0 "Public Feasts"
 feast_of_the_gods_reform_4_desc:0 "Though our people may be discontent at our attempts to bring them into the modern day, we have devised a means to keep their ire at bay. We shall pour money into our temples and public institutions to throw grand feasts for the people on each of our most important holidays. Between the free food, drink, and decor, hopefully none will mind the slightly reduced menu."

 feast_of_the_gods_reform_5:0 "Battlefield Exceptions"
 feast_of_the_gods_reform_5_desc:0 "We may be spending the brunt of our efforts on drastically scaling back the role of cannibalism in our society, it may still be useful to retain a few outlets for the most voracious among us. By allowing our soldiers to unleash their pent-up hunger on the battlefield, none will be able to stand in the way of our frenzied charges."

 ogre_flavour_events.1.d:0 "“Terrible news, my [Root.Monarch.GetTitle],” a dismayed advisor laments, their brow coated in a nervous sweat. “I finished tallying our inventory for the national building treasury, and the numbers just didn’t add up: A missing box here, a misplaced tool there, and even entire phantom stockpiles in the worst of cases.\n\n“I wish I could say it was a grand conspiracy, but managers and workers at all levels and across multiple projects have succumbed to their hunger, squandering resources for years - it's practically an open secret! Even should we punish them, the damage is done. This scandal will stall projects for decades to come, and that's not even mentioning the stolen resources in dire need of replacement.\n\n“How should we deal with these hunger-addled larcenists?”"

 ogre_flavour_events.2.d:0 "“Great news, my [Root.Monarch.GetTitle],” a jovial advisor, their brow creased in delightful contours, lauds. “I finished tallying our inventory for the national building treasury, and the numbers just didn’t add up: a second box here, a backup tool there, and even entire extra stockpiles in the best of cases.\n\n“I wish I could say it was a grand conspiracy, but managers and workers at all levels and across multiple projects have squashed their hunger, preserving resources for years - it's practically an open secret! Even should we reward them, the boon is undeniable. This serendipity will advance projects for decades to come, and that's not even mentioning the spare resources in dire need of application.\n\n“How should we spend this unexpected excess?”"
 ogre_flavour_events.2.a:0 "Let us put this surplus to good use."
 ogre_flavour_events.2.b:0 "Sell the excess."
 ogre_flavour_events.2.c:0 "Lord this wealth over our underlings."

 ogre_flavour_events.3.t:0 "A Fistful of Coin"
 ogre_flavour_events.3.d:0 "Bellicose voices clog the halls of our capital, sapping [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s patience and attention. As two disparate parties stand before the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] divided by a line of guards, they finally simmer down, allowing the first group comprising a colorful mishmash of small peoples to speak.\n\n“Is this how [Root.GetName] treats its daring soldiers of fortune? We braved the unknown and deadly for equal shares of all treasure, but when we completed our quest, these-” the mercenary casts a lurid eye at the opposing party before biting their tongue. “They reneged on our promised dues. What shite!”\n\nThe second group, a cadre of ogre warriors, shrugs nonchalantly at their lesser former-partners.\n\n“My [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], it is the law that all equal shares are done by the fistful. Is it our fault they have such diminutive hands? Perhaps these foreigners should have spent a moment learning our customs before doing business in our lands? They walked half as far and carried half as much during our contract; by all accounts, they have been compensated fairly. In fact, they should pay us a higher share for our labor and-”\n\nThe curses and hollers resume between the irate parties, but [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] considers the conundrum: True, ogre tradition for fair shares involves literal fistfuls at a time, but even with the adventurers unaware of this practice, they surely are still entitled to equitable booty? Who comes out on top in this disagreement?"
 ogre_flavour_events.3.a:0 "An ogre’s helping for all parties."
 ogre_flavour_events.3.b:0 "A fistful means a fistful, no matter how puny."

 ogre_flavour_events.4.t:0 "Feasting Hall Festivity Risks the Hunger"
 ogre_flavour_events.4.d:0 "Party-going ogres across the nation are shivering with excitement over an upcoming festival in [Root.GetName]. Centered on a massive feasting hall capable of hosting entire clans with room to spare, the gathering is sure to delight with mirth, merriment, and morsels, yet as attendance threatens to break records, we know better: a hungry ogre is a deadly ogre.\n\nAs we assess the festival’s preparations, too many attendees and too few supplies could turn a wonderful celebration into all-consuming chaos in more ways than one! Even the whole region could face disaster before the devourers stop their rampage!\n\nAlthough it might be expensive, we should spare some funds to ensure that the festival is well-stocked. How should we proceed?"
 ogre_flavour_events.4.a:0 "Six dozen more party crates. Now!"
 ogre_flavour_events.4.b:0 "The current preparations are adequate."
 ogre_flavour_events.4.c:0 "Some choice souls should satiate our needs."
 ogre_flavour_events.4.e:0 "I know not, I feel naught, I am apart from the “I” of hunger..."

 ogre_flavour_events.5.t:0 "An Ogre Mage Seeks Damestear"
 ogre_flavour_events.5.d:0 "“I am glad you beckoned to destiny’s gnawing call.”\n\nAn enigmatic ogre speaks surrounded by guards in the capital hall, their body wreathed in cloth stitched with foreboding runes of power. Reaching to their head, the figure lowers their cowl, revealing damestear-blue skin and blinding eyes that surges with magic: an ogre mage. Grinning, they bow deeply, their gaze affixed to [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName].\n\n“I come here before you as a loyal servant. Hark; I can stand tall as a giant among spellcasters if given the chance! All I require is ample damestear to complete my ritual and sate my hunger.”\n\nThe pride and folly of mages on full display, the room gasps and seethes, yet the ogre mage continues.\n\n“Should my ritual prove successful, I shall rise above lowly cantrips and meager spells. Yes, I shall bend the world to m-...your will, my [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. All I require is your trust and aid.”\n\nIt takes a daring (or reckless) soul to demand a king’s weight in damestear. Advisors whisper into the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]’s ear. There is no guarantee that such a ritual will succeed, or that the mage will not abscond given the chance; not to mention the upset damestear suppliers having their allotment confiscated for this endeavor. Yet a powerful mage can turn the tide of battles, and supporting mages, even an upstart one such as this, could prove popular among spellcasters.\n\nHow does [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] respond to this audacious ogre mage?"
 ogre_flavour_events.5.a:0 "They shall gorge upon their precious damestear."
 ogre_flavour_events.5.b:0 "If you were truly so powerful, you’d have gotten it yourself."
 ogre_flavour_events.5.c:0 "Test both body and spirit; if they survive, they may prove useful."
 ogre_flavour_events.5.e:0 "To plug the hunger with magic is not wisdom."
 ogre_flavour_events.5.f:0 "Stuff their gullet with damestear and see what happens."
 ogre_flavour_events.5.g:0 "T’ch; we have channels for this."

 ogre_flavour_events.6.t:0 "Giant Ruins Discovered"
 ogre_flavour_events.6.d:0 "When giants ruled Halann in many ages past, we labored alongside our troll cousins as their builders and servants. During and after their mighty falls, our forebears rarely had the luxury or foresight to preserve elements of that ancient history;  indeed, countless giant remnants remain forgotten and buried… until now. News of a recently unearthed giant ruin in [Root.GetName] has electrified the realm with tales of beautiful art, massive structures that dwarf an ogre, and even surviving texts detailing lost or misremembered fragments of history. \n\nHowever, this discovery presents conundrums for our government: How should we preserve this site? Should we renovate and restore it? What is the black market rate for a chipped giant mead tankard?\n\nAs the rightful owners, what should we do with this monumental ruin?"
 ogre_flavour_events.6.a:0 "The state shall preserve it for posterity."
 ogre_flavour_events.6.b:0 "Peddle the trinkets for spoils."
 ogre_flavour_events.6.c:0 "An empire of our past is a jewel of our authority today."

 ogre_flavour_events.7.t:0 "Tiny Tools for Tinier Tools"
 ogre_flavour_events.7.d:0 "Tink. Clank. Bang. Zzz. “DAMNIT!”\n\nThe sounds of industry and creation have rung in an ogre’s ear like music ever since we labored under the giants’ yoke as makers and builders. When we erected their homes, beautified their cities, and paved their roads, we did so with their imperial bounty: ample crafting materials, architectural genius and oversight, and unbreakable tools. Though not all monuments to their greatness still stand, the work we did - the labor our ancestors accomplished - was without peer.\n\nBut that time is long, long gone. In the current age of small peoples, cutting edge tools are rarely ogre-sized, leaving our brightest minds impatiently waiting for impractical or custom-made intermediaries to bridge the gap between teensy and wieldy. In our recent past, we simply made do, although “making do” often meant doing without. To stand atop the world as the greatest artisans, we need a homemade tools industry - cost be damned! Should that prove too expensive, we could also commission the smallfolk crafters to assist us, but that would require their cooperation and motivation, be it coin or fear.\n\nWhat should our course of action be to alleviate this hardware deficiency?"
 ogre_flavour_events.7.a:0 "Sponsor a homemade industry for appropriately-sized tools."
 ogre_flavour_events.7.b:0 "Who needs these tiny toys?"
 ogre_flavour_events.7.c:0 "Subsidize the foreign middleware markets."
 ogre_flavour_events.7.e:0 "Put an order at the local glassmakers."
 ogre_flavour_events.7.f:0 "Make requests of our client-states."

 ogre_flavour_events.8.t:0 "A Contemporary Ordering"
 ogre_flavour_events.8.d:0 "“The mountains sway upon Halann’s shoulders,” or so the giant idiom goes.\n\nAs ogres, we recall how the giants’ rule differed: Ice, Cloud, Stone, Hill, Storm, and many more. Yet across continents, eras, and rulers, the giants ruled us with purpose: clear, clever purpose.\n\nFrom our seats of power, we see a mirror of those ancient days, with us as the giants lording over smallfolk who labor to spare our wrath or earn our satisfaction. But these structures are rarely clear or consistent, causing civil unrest for giantkin-smallfolk relations. Sometimes the small peoples occupy important positions or accrue great wealth, raising questions on how their societal power measures against the ruling giantkin.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] sought to address this issue in [GetYear] by imposing an ordering of society. With such a vast and varied spectrum of giant law to emulate, however, exactly how to incorporate the small peoples into ogre society demands concrete and lasting answers: should they be used and abused like slaves, protected by our gracious guidance like the meager subjects they are, or something else entirely?"
 ogre_flavour_events.8.a:0 "So as the giants, so shall we!"
 ogre_flavour_events.8.b:0 "The peoples beneath us shall know our benevolence and grace."
 ogre_flavour_events.8.c:0 "Tie standing on strength of chi."
 ogre_flavour_events.8.e:0 "Stratify based on piety and self-discipline."
 ogre_flavour_events.8.f:0 "The more daring and voracious, the stronger the standing."

As a sign of goodwill, I offer you a cart full of delicious corpses ready to be eaten. I hope you enjoy this tribute as a worthy [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] should.”\n\nWhile the offer is tempting, perhaps rejecting it would be a better option if we wish to set an example for the rest of our subjects."
 ogre_flavour_events.10.a:0 "Get this man out of here and throw his bribe into the river!"
 ogre_flavour_events.10.b:0 "Thank you my vassal, I shall feast on your tribute!"

 ogre_flavour_events.11.d:0 "Hunger is the most characteristic aspect of an ogre, especially for the meat of others. However, during times of special scarcity, like the current one, this meat is a rare privilege, leaving our state with the task of providing food to our people. Some of our populace, however, have begun to refuse to eat their new foods as a form of protest. While these protests are mostly harmless, the hunger has in recent days caused a local ogre to go on a rampage, eating other people.\n\nWhile this would normally be a tragedy, the reaction has been surprising, with most of the local ogres openly envious, wishing it could have been them who got to indulge and go on a feeding rampage."
