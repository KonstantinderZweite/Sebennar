 devandi.1.t: "Unifying Soul of Nahrei"
 devandi.1.d: "The last ceremony of the weeks-long festival of the Unifying Soul of Nahrei has come just in time, for the [Root.GetAdjective] have begun to grow restless. They have spent the past month in deep meditation and introspection on the nature of the world and their place in it. The ceremony begins and ends with the Flyransh, or “Flower Dance,” in which the [Root.GetAdjective] dance around a flower-wreathed pole, as each dancer individually approaches the central pole to pray to the souls. But the true boon of the festival is not seen until the last Flyransh ends. Afterwards, there is a feeling of energy in the air, as each [Root.GetAdjective] is eager to apply their learnings to the world."
 devandi.1.a: "Sometimes all it takes is a little gratitude."
 devandi.2.t: "Solid Fortitude"
 devandi.2.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] can feel it: war has come to [Root.GetName]. In the past, all-out conflict was rare among the Devandi, but times are changing. Thus, [Root.Monarch.GetName] has taken to rousing the army of [Root.GetName] with a terrific speech, reminding them of the great gift of freedom given to them by the liberator Munakles and their duty to preserve it in the face of the oppressors. Afterwards, [Root.Monarch.GetName] can notice a small but substantial difference in the behavior of the columns: the soldiers stand straighter. Conversation has ceased, and every soldier has a determined gleam in their eye."
 devandi.2.a: "Our cause is righteous!"
 devandi.3.t: "An Offering"
 devandi.3.d: "A priest of [Root.GetName] approaches the wood-hewn altar with an offering to the souls. The Devandi do not sacrifice their wealth or raw resources, for they know that the souls are too wise to accept that. Instead, they sacrifice their sentimental items and keepsakes, however valuable they may be; That which the priest has placed on the sacred altar.\n\nOver the course of a few hours, the items on the altar evaporate and disintegrate into dust as the surrounding [Root.GetAdjective]s offer hushed last-minute prayers to the souls. The blessing of the souls is subtle: the next few harvests are a little healthier. Laborers work a little harder. The nation of [Root.GetName] is a little more energized."
 devandi.3.a: "Thank the Souls!"
 devandi.4.t: "Seismic Sense"
 devandi.4.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] watches as the geomancers of [Root.GetName], known as Femezkhanz, scour the lands for gems and precious stones. The progress of the Femezkhanz is quick and silent, for they never need to stop to dig or examine the ground. Suddenly, the group ceases their quick gait, and [Root.Monarch.GetName] smiles as they dispatch a messenger. The Femezkhanz, with their magical sense, have almost certainly discovered a significant cache of valuable ore below their location. Within the day, a group of zealous [Root.GetAdjective] miners will be sent to settle the area. As the message-bearer draws closer, [Root.Monarch.GetName] ponders one last question: what mineral could it be?"
 devandi.4.a: "Hopefully something valuable."
 devandi.5.t: "Grand Pilgrimage"
 devandi.5.d: "The Mazhthramazh faith is more than a millennium old, but its teachings are timeless. The wise words of Munakles and the animalistic beliefs of the Devandi are transmitted orally and, as such, have become scattered throughout the Valley. Thus, the goal of each pilgrim is to travel around the holy Valley visiting each region to learn its unique stories and aphorisms, as well as visiting the informal holy sites of Mazhthramazh. This is the journey that [Root.Monarch.GetName] has embarked on, and over the next few weeks, with a caravan of Femezkhanz, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] will visit all, from the most rural Mteibhar village to the most travelled monuments of Mzhaara. "
 devandi.5.a: "Bless the Valley!"
 devandi.6.t: "Raid!"
 devandi.6.d: "The land of [askaeorg_raid_target.GetName] is aflame, for the Chendhyans have come through. The farmlands burn, and the minor settlements stand silent and vacant, having been looted by the raiders. There was very little resistance, for the cat-riders are far too wily and quick to be caught, and the inhabitants of [askaeorg_raid_target.GetName] too scared to engage. The ancient strategy of the Chendhyans, known as the Qahliræ, involves three steps: first, ravage the undefended countryside; then, loot the smaller settlements; then, if the enemy is distracted, attempt to pierce into the cities to cause further chaos and take more."
 devandi.6.a: "Such is Life!"
 
 #Religious Abilities
 unifying_soul_of_nahrei: "Unifying Soul of Nahrei"
 desc_unifying_soul_of_nahrei: "The festival of the Unifying Soul of Nahrei, despite what its name may suggest, is not a brief celebration but rather a weeks-long period of intense introspection for the Devandi. The Unifying Soul of Nahrei is interspersed with festivals, each dedicated to learning about and discussing a certain aspect of Nahrei, the creator soul. The celebration bears its name from the ending festival, known as the Unifying Soul. By calling our nation to this celebration, we may give them a greater appreciation for this world and its possibilities."
 solid_fortitude: "Solid Fortitude"
 desc_solid_fortitude: "The central tenet in the teachings of Munakles is freedom and the necessity of its preservation. It must be protected at all costs, even if that means attacking first. By reminding our warriors of the enormous importance of their fight, they will certainly be more ferocious."
 a_sense_of_freedom: "A Sense of Freedom"
 desc_a_sense_of_freedom: "The Devandi believe that times of peace and freedom are only temporary and that eventually they will once more face hardship. Thus, during prosperous periods, Devandi rulers will often hold nationwide celebrations of the sense of freedom that their people enjoy."
 an_offering: "An Offering"
 desc_an_offering: "Followers of the tradition of Munakles believe that they must seek a closer tie to the souls of Halann, who typically represent an aspect of the world. The Devandi typically offer personal possessions to the souls in exchange for guidance on achieving freedom of the mind, body, and spirit. However, Devandi rulers in the past have not shied away from requesting material blessings from the souls, of course, when they are willing to pay the price."
 bonds_of_the_world: "Bonds of the World"
 desc_bonds_of_the_world: "We were all created by the souls, and we were all brought to safety and freedom by Munakles, who taught us to remember our common heritage and our common goals. By emphasizing unity, Devandi rulers in the past have loosened tensions along with purse strings."
 seismic_sense: "Seismic Sense"
 desc_seismic_sense: "The Femezkhanz are the mage class of the Mteibhar, who are magically attuned to the ground of Halann. They are capable of easily manipulating the earth, but they are especially useful to the Mteibhar because of their ability to sense ores and precious metals. Influential rulers often leverage the Femezkhanz to find prime spots for settlement and excavation."
 plains_of_learning: "Plains of Learning"
 desc_plains_of_learning: "The teachings of Munakles emphasize betterment and adaptation over tradition. As such, Mazhthramazh rulers often send delegations to neighboring nations to examine and learn from them."
 grand_pilgrimage: "Grand Pilgrimage"
 desc_grand_pilgrimage: "The sacred valley is large, and the teachings of Mazhthramazh are not centralized. Individual regions carry their own unique stories, teachings, and interpretations of the Mazhthramazh worldview. By visiting or traveling around the Mteibas, a ruler may learn much."
 dance_of_the_flying_serpents: "Dance of the Flying Serpents"
 desc_dance_of_the_flying_serpents: "It is said that when the Chendhyans encroached into Taychend, at Armahadastir, they adopted the native Dance of the Flying Serpents to make peace with the Taychendi. Eventually, the dance became a way to instill peace and balance in times of strife."
 hunt_of_togetherness: "Hunt of Togetherness"
 desc_hunt_of_togetherness: "Hunts are the common language of the Chendhyans; they are integral to daily life and an easy way to bond or resolve differences. Powerful Chendhyan rulers in the past have used tribal hunts to rally their warriors and soldiers before a war or battle."
 askaeorg_raid: "Raid!"
 desc_askaeorg_raid: "There is no better exclamation of Chendhyan faith than the raid. All Chendhyans understand the passion and righteousness behind the act of attacking one’s neighbors and seizing their valuables. It is utterly just, for the Askaeorg faith demands that its followers proactively preserve their freedom."
