 pasiragha_affirming_our_ties_title:0 "Affirming our Ties"
 pasiragha_affirming_our_ties_desc:0 "Pasiragha is the senapti of the west, whose etymological roots define it literally as the western kingdom. It is our duty to watch the hills, to defend the passes and to see the Raj's will done in the lower highlands and valleys. Yet with our current power base this grows more difficult by the day. Perhaps it is time to solidify our political position, and grow our strength for the good of the Raja."
 pasiragha_develop_port_title:0 "Develop our Principal Port"
 pasiragha_develop_port_desc:0 "Attyhuyaba is now firmly in our hands, and gives us access to the Sea of Rahen - a luxury previously denied to us. With a new port we can more easily attract the scholars and pilgrims that will strengthen our intellectual strength, and bolster our economy. To that end, we must expand the port, our principal port."
 pasiragha_failing_peace_title:0 "The Failing Peace"
 pasiragha_failing_peace_desc:0 "The realm is collapsing. Countless decades of mismanagement, blatant favourtism and rampant corruption has crippled the Raj from within. The empire is barely held together by the Vizier Manava, and only then because he refuses to die. It is only a matter of time before the senaptis and prahbis must take their destiny into their own hands. Preparations must be made."
 pasiragha_coast_war_title:0 "War for the Coast"
 pasiragha_coast_war_desc:0 "With the approval of our allies and patrons, the time for war has come. To reclaim the coast for the Raj. A land which has long since rebelled and broken away. The western kingdom shall return those riches to realm at large, and at long last claim a port of our own."
 pasiragha_western_estates_title:0 "The Western Estates"
 pasiragha_western_estates_desc:0 "On our western border lies the lands of Ghabrabhi and Dhurasidheni, the latter of which holds the final resting place of Rama Nar Singh. The value of this land is currently squandered under the current administration. With some proper stewarship, it could be converted into a proper hub of trade and pilgrimage, but first we need to aquire it."
 pasiragha_nar_singh_stupa_title:0 "Rama Nar Singh's Stupa"
 pasiragha_nar_singh_stupa_desc:0 "Upon the an undescript hill, approximately 5 miles west of the High Temple of Dhurasodheni, lies the Stupa of Rama Nar Singh. An ancient monument built in the early 200's dedicated to the philosopher's life and deeds. It has, over the centuries, fallen into disrepair and neglect.\n\nAs part of our plan to attract pilgrims and travellers, we should reviatlize this site."
 pasiragha_ensure_saftey_title:0 "Ensure Pilgrim's Saftey"
 pasiragha_ensure_saftey_desc:0 "Pilgrims are a common site in Rahen, for the only way to see th High Temples is to go there yourself. Sure, there are Brahmkalaas that provide detailed replications of the art works, but they are inheirently flawed - influenced deeply by the views of their makers.\n\nAs the steward of the Hall of Endless debate, and now two diffferent High Temples, it is our duty to protect these pilgrims as they travel our lands. Let us renovate the trails roads and paths."
 pasiragha_future_of_hall_title:0 "The Future of the Hall"
 pasiragha_future_of_hall_desc:0 "Pasiragha is defined by her highlands and more importantly, The Hall of Endless debate. The massive structure has been the center of Rayavashapal for as long as city held any position of importance. Rayavashapal breathes in tune with the coming and going of the philosophers and scholars that tread the paths of that great building. Yet at this moment her future is uncertain..."
 pasiragha_ravanars_plan_title:0 "Ravanar's Plan"
 pasiragha_ravanars_plan_desc:0 "We are currently walking an unknown path. The future before us is uncertain, but Ravanar has a plan. A close advisor to the senapti, and long time military advisor, he has returned from a long trek into the Ghankhaden Highlands. His military venture taught him much about convoy protection and guerilla tactics, and he wants to begin training a cadre of light infantry around this new model."
 pasiragha_defend_interior_title:0 "Defend the Interior"
 pasiragha_defend_interior_desc:0 "With our recent conquests we have finally pushed our borders beyond the immediate surroundings of Rayavashapal. A proposal has been put forward to construct a new band of fortifications around our core territories. Without the threat of immediate seige our farmlands and cities would be able to flourish like never before."
 pasiragha_hall_to_district_title:0 "From Hall to District"
 pasiragha_hall_to_district_desc:0 ""Five more books to be carried out, the door closes and at that moment you are invisible, a ghost in the hall"\n-Saer Halliday\n\nThe hall bustles with activity scholars from all across the Raj come to read and learn. Her libraries grow with new tomes and treatisies, and the ampitheatres are always full - racaus and bold.\n\nWhile the hall did not come from humble beginnings, she has grown to encompass a district. New inns, apartments, homes, and rennovatiosn have spiraled out from her. The veins and arteries of a reviatalized heart beating in the center of Rayavashapal."
 pasiragha_painful_birth_title:0 "Painful is Birth"
 pasiragha_painful_birth_desc:0 "To exist is to search for happiness, to struggle against the suffering of reality, but most do not see this truth. Guru Suhan, an Ascendant Soul philosopher from the Yan river valley has traveled westward to arrive in our place of worship. He bring with him a new doctrine of multipilicity and syncretims. Where paths once spread outwards into the forest of wisdom, Suhans has unified them once again. He has forged a path composed of all, and regardless of his intentions, each step on that new path will be soaked in blood."
 pasiragha_expand_school_title:0 "Expand School Grounds"
 pasiragha_expand_school_desc:0 "Attached to one of the hall's many chambers is the Rayavashapal School of Principles. The school's curicullum is centered on the four tenants of: politics, economics, philosophy, and historical tradition. It has historically been one of the preeminant centers of education and learning, but has lost much of its prestige over the past century. Right now, it is nothing more than a stamp for the elite, practically a vacation destination rather than a school. We must correct this course."
 pasiragha_entice_thinkers_title:0 "Entice Future Thinkers"
 pasiragha_entice_thinkers_desc:0 "A rennovated school is nothing without teachers and students. Most philosophers within Rayavashapal would rather spend their days debating within the hall or ruminanting their hour away within High Temples and small cells. We must provide incentives for them to teach, perhaps even make it a requirement that some of their lectures and arguments take place on school grounds. Then we can begin the hard work of attracting the students of the next generation."
 pasiragha_broadening_scope_title:0 "Broadening Our Scope"
 pasiragha_broadening_scope_desc:0 "Avhavubhiya now overflows with goods and trade ships unloading their cargo and pilgrims. A fair number of these travellers come from far away lands, amd a few have even graced The Hall with their presence. The debate halls have never been livlier, and many of our philosophers nwo request that we encourage this exchange of ideas and people; we must bring them in from far and wide."
 pasiragha_gulf_bases_title:0 "Securing Bases in the Gulf"
 pasiragha_gulf_bases_desc:0 "While the western approaches to Avhavubhiya are relatively well defended and patrolled, the waters of the east to the south of Bhuvari are rife with piracy. Massive fleats to raids shorelines and assail merchants, and even Vangham sometimes serves as a base for these cutthroats. In order to secure safe passage from the east we must put a stop to this plague.  First, we will need to secure some new forward bases for our fleets."
 pasiragha_convoy_security_title:0 "Convoy Security"
 pasiragha_convoy_security_desc:0 "With a proper base in Houdoduwo, we can bring our campaign against the pirates to its rightful conclusion. To the south east are their primary bases within Hoangdesinh, but more importantly, they hold several islands within the Ringlet chain. If we do not flush them from their hiding places on those jungle islands, they will merely raise new forces and strike once again. The Ringlet Isles must come under our control."
 pasiragha_colonial_truth_title:0 "Spreading Truth"
 pasiragha_colonial_truth_desc:0 "Across the Gulf of Rahen, on the northern shore of Sarhal, is the land of the Mengi. A people's whose coastline has for many years slowly come under the control of various Raheni merchant republics. Yet, they are poor stewards of this land. The native peoples who follow our faith are given some degree of special treatment sure, but there is little to no effort to protect them.\n\nAs the rightful ruler of the western Raj, it our duty to step in, and take control of this situation."
 pasiragha_inter_school_coop_title:0 "Inter-School Cooperation"
 pasiragha_inter_school_coop_desc:0 "While High Philosophy appears to be a united faith, in practice many of the schools hold diametically opposed beliefs from one another. Golden Palace, Ascendant Soul, and Starry Eye scholars constantly butt heads over the nature of atma and whether or not visatama exists at all. Even in that microcosm of metaphysical disagreement, one can see that the cracks run deep. Yet, it is our duty as the steward of the Hall to bring them together. To permit them a co-operative enviornment, even if it is bound solely to the confines of our great building. A commitment we must uphold to a higher degree as the reformation rages about us."
 pasiragha_promote_residents_title:0 "Promote Residents"
 pasiragha_promote_residents_desc:0 "The scholars, theologians, and philosophers who visit the Hall have increasingly begun to put down roots. Many bring their whole families with them when they arrive in port. While officially this practice is discouraged, no one has enforced any of the regulations so long as they can fend for themselves. As a result, within Avhavubhiya and Rayavashapal, there has been a growth of immigrant districts where the crafts and customs of their homes shine through in food, goods, and architectue. While there is a vocal minority which condems the foreigners, most city officials see them as a positive windfall and have even brought forward a proposal to expand this district and provide official recognition."
 pasiragha_exilarchs_modest_proposal_title:0 "The Exilarch's Proposal"
 pasiragha_exilarchs_modest_proposal_desc:0 "Fires have burned down several districts in our major cities, and we are now left to pick up the pieces. However, the source of the problem, immigrant communities that lie outside of the caste system still remains. Finding a way to integrate them into our society has become a hotly debated question. Yet one answer has come to the surface: perhaps the new outsiders could be guided by the old outsiders.\n\nThe Exilarch has long been the leader of the dwarves in exile, awaiting a day that they may return to their ancestral homeland. Historically, we have had an excellent relationship with the Exilarch. Perhaps we could officially bring him into our government? Provide him a position of authority, and allow him to be the voice for all who lie outside of the caste system."
 pasiragha_battle_of_will_title:0 "The Battle of Will"
 pasiragha_battle_of_will_desc:0 "The reformation is a battle fought on many fronts, not just in the Hall or the battlefield, but also in the hearts and minds of rulers. For it is the ruling castes which enforce doctrine and will upon their subjects. The Senapti posseses a unique position given the starting point of the reformation, perhaps they can win over some hearts and minds with the pen instead of the sword?"
 pasiragha_upgrade_paths_title:0 "Upgrade the Paths"
 pasiragha_upgrade_paths_desc:0 "With most of the Ghankhaden Highlands under our control, we can begin to extend our trails and roads through the mountains and hills. Dhakilamvi will serve as the next terminus. It is there that Rama Nar Singh's teaching on atma were fully syncretized into High Philosophy within the old governor's palace in 146. While we pave new roads, we should also take the time to invest in the old infastructure. Engineering has come quite a ways since the first paths were laid in dirt and stone and they are due for an upgrade."
 pasiragha_new_dogma_title:0 "A New Dogma"
 pasiragha_new_dogma_desc:0 "The strife of the past few years has finally come to a close, and a new Pasiragha has emerged from the chaos. A new dogma has been forged, and it is her duty as the steward of the Hall to spread that doctrine near and far. Preparations must be made, for the battle for the purtara of a nation has begun."
 pasiragha_western_authority_title:0 "Authority in the West"
 pasiragha_western_authority_desc:0 "We have positioned ourself as the true western authority when it comes to matters of High Philosophy. We have spread our doctrine throughout the land by word and sword. Our spiritual authority is unquestioned. Now all that is left to do, is to solidify this position. Hence, like the philosophers of centuries past, we will organize a council."
 pasiragha_legacy_of_reformation_title:0 "Legacy of the Reformation"
 pasiragha_legacy_of_reformation_desc:0 "Suhan has come and gone, his bones returned to the soil, but his faith has not perished, nor has its followers. His disciples still spread his message far and wide, and philosophers of the traditional schools follow them at every turn. Yet, for the everyday person, things have settled down. The wars are over, and historians have begun to properly look at the events that took place these past decades. A legacy has been laid down by our hand, but the question is, what will history think of us?"
 pasiragha_unity_of_spirit_land_title:0 "Unity of Land and Spirit"
 pasiragha_unity_of_spirit_land_desc:0 "We stand at a prescipice. Our goals were never purley of conquest, yet that is the machine we have created, and it is clear that the Raj is collapsing. It has been for some time now.\n\nWe have the heart and soul of the old Raj in our hands and it yearns to be reunited with the body once more, to become one with the empire, and to stear her towards better days. It is time for us to assume the mantle of the Raj."
 pasiragha_battle_of_body_title:0 "The Battle of Body"
 pasiragha_battle_of_body_desc:0 "War is coming, and Pasiragha is not ready. We have trained men into small elite units, not into massive formations, yet the latter is what will be necessary to survive in this age of reformation. While Ravanar's light infantry tactics have been massively successful on the small scale, we will have to pick and choose the parts of that doctrine which are imparted onto the average soldier. A new curriculum focusing intense march drills through rocky terrain will provide our troops an edge in quickly closing the gap between retreating forces. We will strike quickly and melt away before we can be pinned by bloody costly engagements."
 pasiragha_ofehbi_freedom_title:0 "Ofehibi Philosophers"
 pasiragha_ofehbi_freedom_desc:0 "While our philosophy has been spread to the communities of the Srahal coast, there are still those within the interior who share our views. Small communities within Mewojala, Simegesfan and Mewomender still follow the wisdom of the High Gods and should be placed under our protection.\n\nThe big question within government circles is how? While we could begin carving a path into the interior of the continent, such a war would surely be expensive, so perhaps a diplomatic solution is more appropriate. The Raja will have the final say on the matter."
 pasiragha_farther_afield_title:0 "Ideas from Farther Afield"
 pasiragha_farther_afield_desc:0 "Each day our grasp widens and encompases more peoples and new ideas. Yet there are still those beyond our reach. There are stories of peoples from beyond the deserts of Bulwar that follow a rational philosophy, and even further still tales of a people in Alecand who hold a unique philosophy of government.\n\nLike all peoples they are welcome to the Hall, but we have to get them here first. A series of naval bases around the southern coast of Sarhal would provide our fleets the necessary range such that we may begin making inroads."
 pasiragha_simralka_title:0 "Restore the Simralka"
 pasiragha_simralka_desc:0 "The Simralka ultimately served as the center for a philosophical renaissance within Keyattordha. While it would take Rama Nar Singh nearly half a decade to attract a meaningful following, the Simralka would thereafter support him for almost the entire second half of his life. Situated on what is now known as the Phulaandgara, the original school was little more than a small collection of furniture, and a single stone pavilion. The Simralka would grow over the next two decades to consist of two lecture halls, a debate room, sleeping quarters for Rama Nar Singh and other philosophers. Nowadays the site is an old ruin, barely noticeable through the greenery and centuries of sediment build up, but this is something we can fix."
 pasiragha_joint_expedition_title:0 "A Joint Expedition"
 pasiragha_joint_expedition_desc:0 "The Exilarch has brought forward an interesting proposition. There are many dwarves within our realm who still wish more than anything else to return to the mountains of their ancestors. For most of history this has seemd like little more than a pipe dream pushed by small adventuring bands, but with the recources of the Raj, this might just be possible. The Exilarch's plan is to set up a joint expeditionary board which would manage Grozumdhir under the protection of the Raj. He would serve as their representative within the Raj while any who did not wish to live under the new system would be free to move to the new dwarven home. All he needs now is approval."
 pasiragha_lessons_of_gov_title:0 "Lessons of Governance"
 pasiragha_lessons_of_gov_desc:0 "Pasiragha has benefitted greatly from the scholars and philosophers we have brought into our borders over the past centuries, and many have identified issues within our government. While most of those criticisms come from a place of ignorance (especially in regards to the caste system) some do make valid points. In particular our legistlative body is an antiquated relic of our days under the old Raj's thumb. Once the realm is sufficiently stable, we can begin to implement some of these suggestions. The real question is a matter of whose vision we follow."
 pasiragha_restore_visatama_title:0 "Restore Visatama"
 pasiragha_restore_visatama_desc:0 "We have been the beating heart and beacon of reason of the Raj for some time now. Yet now, we possess the body as well. A body mistreated over decades as rich corrupt men carved her into pieces - little fiefdoms for their own enrichment. The whole of her form is akin to a corpse, and the work to repair the damage will be immense, but it is a task we must undertake for the good of all within her lands, such that all may reach purtara."
 pasiragha_integrate_roads_title:0 "Integrate the Road Networks"
 pasiragha_integrate_roads_desc:0 "The road networks of the Raj are a mess. While our core territories have standardized templates and consistent engineering, much of the territory we now rule is a patchwork of local dirt paths, the glorious remains of the Golden Highway, and antiquated streets. A key part of our reformation efforts is to incorporate all of these disparate networks together into a cohesive whole. The effort will be immense, and the standardization process is excepted to take decades, but the rewards for our commerce, communication, and military would be incalculable."
 pasiragha_answering_questions_title:0 "Answering the Question"
 pasiragha_answering_questions_desc:0 "An empire has been forged from a single city in the highlands of the western mountains. The western kingdom has become a Raja on par with all but one of her incarnations. The enemies which threatened our existance have been defeated, philosophers are freed from binds, and countless peoples have been shown the wisdom of our doctrines. The Hall bustles with new ideas and new peoples, and our horizon is ever expanding.\n\nMore importantly, we have changed. Pasiragha is no longer the small military governorship of her youth. We have syncretized and integrated ideas and beliefs from cultures around the world. Each of them has left marks on the realm and how we function. The question now stands of who left the biggest mark."
 pasiragha_bury_hatchet_title:0 "Bury the Hatchet"
 pasiragha_bury_hatchet_desc:0 "Bhuvari broke free from the Raj centuries ago. It has grown to become a highly defined culture of its own built on, but seperate from, our own. Many Raja's have tried and failed to conquer its people and subjugate them under the Raj once more. Most doubt Pasiragha would be any different in this respect. Yet there is another way - a path to peace.\n\nIt will not be easy, and will require sacrifice, but a lasting peace would truly be an achievement worth boasting about for generations to come. Will we try to bury the hatchet?"
 pasiragha_secure_wall_title:0 "Secure the Godswall"
 pasiragha_secure_wall_desc:0 "The Godswall is one of High Philosophy's most holy sites. The High Temples and old carvings suggest that it was built by the High God Prathim and then later added to by man. The massive structure of statues and temples stretches towards the heavens, reaching towards the Ascension Plateau. Sadly, it has been under the control of The Command for some time now; it has been left to languish and decay without any care.\n\nWith the Raj stablized we can push back and retake that which was taken from all of High Philosophy. The North will fall under the rule of the Raj once more."

 flavor_pasiragha.100.d:0 "Under the dim glow of the candlelight, a letter falls upon the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s desk. As the messenger hurries away, [Root.Monarch.GetName] reaches for their letter opener, breaks the gold-green seal of The Hall, and lets their eyes roll over the paper.\n\n/”Let this missive be a record of the resolve of The Hall and her most esteemed members. The stabilizing threads of the past decades have finally begun to unwind, and the Raj as a whole now lies at a dangerous precipice. While we philosophers of The Hall cannot enforce the reforms that are desperately needed, we can, and do, commit to keeping The Hall open during the times of strife almost certain to come.../”\n\nThe [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] reads through the rest of the letter's contents: requests for architectural funding, as well as troops for escort duties. Most interesting however is a proposal to revive the right of the rulers of Pasiragha to sponsor traveling scholars, so long as the ruler attends a number of debates.\nThese are all interesting ideas, and there is potential for more. A chance to put your finger on the development of a peoples' culture, their government, and their philosophy."

Massing below the two men is a group of a thousand soldiers. Each man carries a hatchet and is dressed in light cavalry armor, decorated in the yellow and green colors of Pasiragha. Yet despite their attire, all remain on foot with packs and gear provisioned for woody terrain.\n\nRavanar stands up, looking to [Root.Monarch.GetName]. A nod passes between them, and the horn blares behind them. The men below rush to stations. Formations coalesce in a flash, before disappearing as quickly as they formed. Most of the soldiers dissolve into the forest, while a small contingent led by the captain forms a guard around a cart. Ravanar speaks: “I've taught them all I can from my times in the north: guerilla warfare, light infantry tactics and formation fighting. I have never been more proud of a cadre of troops.”\n\nThe clash of arms comes suddenly, as the forest erupts below. Men rush the caravan, and the clash of training weapons against metal can be heard even up on the cliff top. The captain directs the valiant defense until the horn blares once more - nearly ten minutes later.\n\nWhen inspected, the cart has not a single scratch upon it, and [Root.Monarch.GetName] smiles."

Cracked mud bricks and the occasional cobblestone suggest that this road was once cared for, even regularly maintained. Today, however, it is little more than a decrepit trail through the wilderness. Any caravan traveling this way is lucky to make the trip without breaking a wheel, and the marching boots of thousands of soldiers have only intensified the dust, the sand, the debris.\n\n“…at least that was done for a purpose” remarks a weary tax official, from under his hood.\n\nNormally hidden away within the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s palace, he has been sent southward to survey the newly conquered city. It is a short journey of a few days, but his spirit finds even that tedious, and it sours his mood at every turn. It is well, then, that the entourage reaches Avhavubhiya soon after. The convoy guards are especially content, their captain muttering his relief that, in the end, they did not have to cure the tax official of his low spirits by tossing him into lake Tamakhan"

 flavor_pasiragha.103.t:0 "The Ghabrabhi Purchase"
 flavor_pasiragha.103.d:0 "Our western Senapti of Pasiragha has recently seen a rise in wealth and stature. Under the stewardship of [R61.Monarch.GetName], our bulwark against the Salahad has not only ruled their territory admirably, but won glory and gold campaigning in the south. Of course, such enthusiasm is commendable, but with it comes questions. Questions of loyalty, ambition, and ultimately where it will lead them.\n\nNowhere are these questions as urgent as in the Raja's court today. An envoy has arrived from Pasiragha, and with them came a letter. The letter held a request, finely written and immaculately polite. Evidently,  [R61.Monarch.GetName] is not satisfied with their recent acquisitions in the south, and as such, they have presented an offer. They will take direct stewardship of the western cities of Ghabrabhi and Dhurasidheni,  and be given rights to their governance in perpetuity. In exchange, they offer us the borderlands of Setapsim, as well as a significant share of the wealth from their recent wars.\n\nNormally, such a request would be categorically denied. Durasidheni and its environs are our ancestral holdings, and letting them be governed by anyone other than the Raja is a laughable suggestion. Even so,  it is true that the provinces are closer to Pasiragha than the capital. It is not unreasonable to assume that the ruler of Pasiragha could more efficiently develop and administer the land, something our own administration has had difficulties with.  The gold on offer would certainly be welcome, and in a manner of speaking, we are not really giving up any provinces, seeing as Pasiragha is our sworn Senapti. It is less a surrender of territory, and more a redelegation of responsibility - something  [R61.Monarch.GetName]'s letter eagerly points out."

 flavor_pasiragha.104.d:0 "Our envoy has returned, bearing a letter from Dhenijansar. The letter is finely written, but even so, it bears ill news. It seems that our reasonable offer to take up the burden of administering the cities of Ghabrabi and Dhurasidheni  has been refused. While the Raja offers no specific reason for this, numerous veiled remarks are given to our supposedly overambitious nature, and more than one paragraph subtly questions our loyalty. We are gently encouraged to be satisfied with our recent conquests to the south, and commended on our excellent governance of the regions we already own. Finally, we are promised in no uncertain terms that continuing to pursue the ancestral lands of Dhurasidheni will not be tolerated.\n\nWhile this is a regrettable outcome, it need not be the end of this matter. A no is only a no if one cannot offer something more. Abandoning our request entirely is certainly the safer option, and the Raja's letter has made it somewhat clear that they are willing to forget this slight if we simply do the same.\n\nEven so, perhaps we need simply prove that we are fit to govern the lands in question. Pasiragha has no shortage of talented administrators, and it is possible that we could simply sweeten the deal by offering the Raja our finest staff to aid them in governing their realm - something the Lotus Court has had difficulties with recently."

Even when the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] fully expects our relationship with Dhenijansar to bear fruit, a feeling of uncertainty is always to be expected, as there is nothing as fickle as a Raja's pen. The letter was opened, and its content was to be read to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. The Raja has approved of our request to administer Ghabrabhi and Dhurasidheni in their name. Joy washes upon everyone in the room, before [Root.Monarch.GetName] reminds them that the hard work has only just started, with both provinces still needing a number of investments to make them a proper trade and pilgrimage hub of the west. Regardless, this is a development worthy of celebration."

The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] was convinced that the deal we sent to the Raja was more than enough, but dread filled [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] nonetheless, since [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] confidence was clearly misplaced the first time. The time has come for the content of the letter to be read. The Raja has accepted, begrudgingly from the tone of the letter, our request to administer the provinces of Ghabrabhi and Dhurasidheni in their name. A feeling of relief washes upon everyone in the room, [Root.Monarch.GetName] included. The first obstacle in our path to revitalize those provinces has been overcome, but many more works will need to be done in the future."

We appreciate your dedication to the revitalization of the Hall and your general interest in education. It's quite a rare trait to find in lords these days, if I may speak candidly.” Thus speaks the Head Guru of the Hall as he shows the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] around the new section of the Hall of Endless Debates.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] observes the renovated Hall with amusement, but nothing captures [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] attention more than the man following both of them since the start of the tour. His short stature is of note, but so too are his gold scales, and dragon-like head. It's a kobold, [Root.Monarch.GetName] thinks -  [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] has never seen a kobold in person.\n\n“Greetings, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. I came here as a part of the Hall's mission to invite scholars from every side of the world, starting from Yanshen. I heard of your contribution to the Hall from the Head Guru, and for that we would like to thank you. In return for your generosity, we would like to teach your heir to be as capable a leader as you. The burden of leadership often weighs on the unprepared, and we would like to prepare your heir in at least one aspect of it,” says the golden scaled scholar.\n\n“I would like for my heir to learn…”"

It was here that most scholars would argue he began to form his beliefs.\n\nIn direct dissent to the First Council of Sardiphadin, he argued that the High Gods are neither beings to be worshiped nor actively interested in imparting their wisdom to mortals. Instead, the path to enlightenment is to emulate their example and lead a righteous life on earth. The most influential aspect of his thinking, however, was the adoption of the concept of Chi into High Philosophy, called Atma in Raheni languages. Actions taken by the self, he argued, affect the balance of atma, with action from good intention rewarded and action from bad intention leading to ruin.\n\nHis insistence on intention and emulation as the key tenets of the faith sparked the ire of local lords, who saw it as him urging their subjects to focus on themselves instead of serving their masters. After escaping a sham trial held for him, Rama Nar Singh continued to spread his beliefs alongside his followers. He peacefully met his end in western Rahen, joining the sun as it was setting. His cremated ashes were tilled in the gardens near the High Temple of Dhurasidheni, where a small shrine and a stupa currently sits. As we remember the life of the first philosopher, we will carry on his legacy into the future…"

 flavor_pasiragha.111.d.sh:0 "“Dear [Root.Monarch.GetName],\nI hope that you find yourself healthy in these turbulent times. Suhan's teachings have changed the landscape of High Philosophy forever, and there is no way for us to deny that. While I understand that you may resent him for the chaos that his followers brought to this land, his teachings itself hold certain truths that we shouldn't ignore. The schools have drifted apart over small differences, and Suhan decided to show us that the schools were merely parts of the whole truth, syncretizing them by combining aspects of each school.\n\nThat is nothing to say of his critiques of the Raheni society. Slavery was a plague upon Rahen, only benefiting certain groups of people while inciting suffering among the thousands of slaves. Previous Rajas' failure to address this situation had caused great fractures in the Raj, birthing Bhuvauri and negatively affecting Tamatma in the process. The caste was a system of oppressions, created and supported by the ruling class to continue their enjoyment of powers and privileges at the expense of the people of the lower class. This system breeds hatred between the castes, and if we do nothing to address the situations, it may be too late to save ourselves from its consequences.\n\nThis river flood of changes has approached us, and I hope you stand on the right bank, lest you be swept away.\n\nRegards,\n[R61.Monarch.GetName] of [R61.GetName]”"

While I understand that you may argue that he is not responsible for the chaos that his followers brought to this land, his teachings itself were based on an incomplete understanding of the philosophy. The schools have indeed drifted apart, but all of them are based on the same goal of reaching Purtara. The High Gods themselves never delineated any one correct path to Purtara, and so the schools should be allowed to pursuit Purtara in the way they see best.\n\nHis critiques of Raheni society do hold certain merits, but it is again based on an incomplete understanding. Slavery was indeed a shame upon Raheni societies, but it was the greed of previous Rajas that caused this situation to go on as long as it did. The caste system was created to bring stability to the realm and to the atma of the world, and our people are happy to fulfill their roles in society. As long as we do not close our eyes and ears to the needs of our citizens, the caste system will continue to bring harmony to the land of Rahen as it has done for millenia.\n\nThe crossroads of destiny is upon us, and I hope you take the path that leads back to Nitikamarja.\n\nRegards,\n[R61.Monarch.GetName] of [R61.GetName]”"

Immigrants and foreign scholars are being harassed every time they do business outside the district, making them scared to even leave the safety of their houses.

His shorter stature and long beard made him stand out over the others, but members of the council looked very seriously and with respect as the Exilarch started speaking.\n\n“Ladies and Gentlemen of the Council, I'm afraid we have taken the wrong approach in handling the newcomers from the very beginning. The immigrants do not know of our cultures, how we go about doing things, and other aspects of Raheni society. But we shoved them in nonetheless, into a world unknown to them, with neighbours that saw them as strangers with no respect for their way of living. I propose that these foreign populations need a delegate from our people, someone who can be trusted by the Raheni but also could lead these foreigners, gently introducing them to the beautiful cultures that we have in Rahen.” the Exilarch finished, standing in the middle of the room illuminated by the sun.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] thought hard, but only one man came up in his mind.

As the sun stands directly above the city, the Third Council of Rayavashapal is officially opened.\n\nThe main topic of debate concerns the Reformation carried on by Suhan. High Philosophy followers believe that Suhan deviated from the philosophy when he stipulated that there is only one path to Purtara, the Long Path. Praxis followers retort that High Philosophy itself already deviated when they used Visvatma as a justification for the caste system and even worse, slavery. As both sides refuse to budge, a philosopher from Pasiragha takes the stage.\n\n“The scars of the past will always leave a mark, but it is our duty to make sure that we will not be hurt once again. The Praxis has indeed deviated from High Philosophy in a way that I'm sure other Praxist philosophers would agree with. But different views on philosophy do not rule out a relationship between the faiths. Scholars can still be exchanged, and I'm sure all the High Philosophers can view the Praxis like another school. We can peacefully coexist among each other, and we of Pasiragha will humbly take the responsibility to make sure that peace between the faiths is observed,” said the philosopher, smiling."

The Minister of Interior finally speaks.\n\n“My [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], the return of Shamakhad to the Raj has been met with positive news all across Rahen. Many descendants of the refugees fleeing the Hobgoblins years ago are eager to return to the homeland of their forefathers. Before all of that happens though, we need to figure out how we will govern this region. Shamakhad is in need of significant rebuilding efforts, and thus maybe best suited to be administered directly by us. On the other hand, giving the people of Shamakhad control of their own home would greatly improve their perception of us and we would benefit from great goodwill among their government.”"

The letter describes the dire situation of the Raj's past, and also records a plea from the Head Guru of the Hall for the help of [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s predecessor to keep the Hall open in the time of troubles.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] can't help but notice how different the state of the realm is between the time of the letter and today.

They are not alone too, as the Cinnabar Lotus Society and the Simralka now regularly birth philosophers who well compete with those of the Hall in terms of ideas. A turbulent society ravaged by war and incompetent leadership is also gone, and in its place stands a society of peace and prosperity.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] thinks to [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] - had this letter never found itself on the desk of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] predecessor, or had they taken any other action than that which that led to this path, the future would not be the same.

 flavor_pasiragha.200.d:0 "The question of Atma - usually equated to the similar concept of Chi in eastern part of Haless - is a long discussed issue among the philosophers. Rama Nar Singh, one of the most prominent early philosophers, postulated that one's action in life has a direct effect on their atma. He also argued that a person's atma is solely influenced by themselves and that no one, not even masters or lords, could decide the atma of their subjects.\n\nThe modern form of High Philosophy began to take shape after the philosopher Tarphenday of the Chromatic Coat published his thoughts in his book On Righteous Society. Tarphenday argued that there is not only atma of the self, but there also exists atma of the world - also known as Visvatma - and atma of existence - Tamatma. Events such as an empire falling would be harmful to the Visvatma and Tamatma, so Tarphenday asserts that it is the moral duty of the individual to maintain atma by fulfilling their role in society and straying from disorderly actions.\n\nThe debate between these two thoughts has raged from the moment Tarphenday's thinking became the accepted view of High Philosophy. Philosophers stress the importance of maintaining the atma of all, as the lack of it dooms Raheni societies to fall into a period of warlordism. Followers of Rama Nar Singh's thought argue instead that the concepts of Visvatma and Tamatma itself are merely a justification to defend corrupt governments across Rahen and to uphold the caste system."

 flavor_pasiragha.201.d:0 "The Yan people believe that there are two souls inside a mortal. One is Hun, the ethereal soul, responsible for our intelligence, atma, and will, while the other, Po, is the soul of the body. After death, both souls are separated; our ethereal soul goes to the sky, while the corporeal soul returns to the land. The Hun thus stays tethered to the material plane, and only by achieving Purtara can our ethereal soul be joined with the High Gods in the afterlife. High Philosophy believes that the ancestor spirits that roam Haless are these stranded Hun, unable to reach Purtara and causing troubles to mortals in their distress.\n\nWith the knowledge that the ethereal soul can be separated and move freely in the world, philosophers began to question whether atma, which is held in the Hun, can also behave the same way. The Ascendant Soul always believed this to be the case, considering atma to move freely in and out of one’s body. They believed that anything could be a medium to hold atma, and that atma could move between these mediums. Philosophers from other schools would disagree however, arguing that atma cannot move between mediums and that there are only three mediums; the individual, the world, and existence itself. They suggest that Ascendant Soul beliefs are influenced by the school's background, as it originated from Yanshen and thus carries traditional Yan belief as the basis of their opinion."

Masterpieces crafted by the High God Pathim herself, it is said that not one High Temple is the same as the other. While it is clear that they are a grand display of the High Gods excellence, the philosophers argue about the nature of their significance. So-called ‘Instantiationist’ scholars argue that because of the divine nature of the High Gods, the High Temples themselves carry some of the divine properties of their creators.   Most others consider the High Temples merely  grandiose buildings,  assigned its spiritual importance by faithful philosophers seeking guidance from the High Gods to live their life.

Every follower of the Philosophy is encouraged to contemplate the meaning of their life and search through the thoughts of previous philosophers in order to know their own path of Nitikamarja. The intent that precedes such religious studies however is a subject of discussion. Rama Nar Singh, one of Haless most prominent philosophers, argued that the intention behind the action is crucial to the balance of one's atma. An action taken with the right intention will be rewarded, while actions done with bad intention will be punished. Yet another philosopher argued that intent itself matters little, as it is by our action alone that we are judged by society and the High Gods. A positive action such as deepening one's knowledge of philosophy thus can only be judged as a positive thing, regardless of how pure the learner's intention was at the beginning of their journey."

Nitikamarja is unique, as people take different paths to achieve the same goal. One might consider creating prosperity itself an expression of Nitikamarja, while for others fulfilling their own roles in society is the Nitikamarja that they strive for. To determine one's own Nitikamarja in this world, one must contemplate and deliberate. While one can do so alone, there is strong encouragement to augment one's understanding by seeking guidance from the philosophers, those who have traveled along the path for much longer.

From the ancient Nadimraj in the north, to the nascent Bhuvauri, states exist to fulfill certain purposes. The purpose of the state itself presents an interesting topic of discussion. At its most basic, a state should protect its citizens from threats to their livelihood, whether  within or without the state itself . A Kheinonist philosopher recently arrived to the Hall has now further argued that the state should look after the best interest of its citizens and adapt to any conditions that may happen, even if it means doing something that may be bad for the atma of the world. His opinion was rejected by his peers, who argue that the state should champion good actions and take a proactive stance in protecting people with no power from the powerful. This discussion should prove fruitful, helping us  determine the kind of state that $COUNTRY$ strives to be."

 flavor_pasiragha.206.d:0 "While we lack detailed accounts of its early years, it is clear High Philosophy had a long and storied path from the early conception to its current form. Born out of the Raheni faith of Devimarja, High Philosophy evolved as it left behind the direct worship of the High Gods in favor of emulating their action to reach spiritual unity with them after death. Each school has a differing opinion on how to achieve that goal, but the common thread between them is urging people to lead a good life on earth. This change in nature from devotion and worship of the High Gods to discussion regarding their actions has led several philosophers to question whether High Philosophy itself should be considered as a religion or, as the name suggests, a philosophy and guidance concerning the daily lives of people."

 flavor_pasiragha.207.t:0 "The Nature of Truth"
 flavor_pasiragha.207.d:0 "The pursuit of knowledge and search for the truth pushes society forward by challenging our assumptions about the world that we live in. As we question every aspect of life, we gain a new understanding that may get us closer to the truth. But sometimes questions go unanswered, and answers may lead us further from the truth. Philosophers have begun asking: what makes something true? By ascertaining this, they hope to better understand where to look for truth.\n\nMost philosophers agree that a statement can be classified as true if it corresponds to a real fact in the world. A statement that 'the Sky is blue' can certainly be said to be true, because the color of the sky is, indeed, blue. However, one Cannorian philosopher in the Hall has presented a statement that aims to show the weakness of this theory. He presented the statement 'This statement is false' and posed questions to the others. If the content of the sentence is indeed false, then the statement holds true, which is problematic since the statement itself declared that it is false.  It is necessary to make a distinction between the language in which the statement was made and the language then used to discuss that statement, in order to determine the truth behind the statement.\n\nSome philosophers walked out of the Hall after the discussion, muttering to themselves: “That was enough philosophy for today”"

 flavor_pasiragha.208.d:0 "The reputation of our Hall has grown so great that scholars and philosophers of different walks of society now routinely gather to exchange information and ideas. One such scholar is a Dwarf, and they have brought news of their own gods, grouped into what is known as the Dwarven Pantheon. Alongside the worship of 'Regent Court' gods by the Cannorians, this pantheon has raised an interesting discussion among the philosophers of the Hall.\n\nEach of these religions revere a group of gods, with each god in turn embodying their own aspect of Godhood. This echoes the High Gods of High Philosophy. Similarities could for example be drawn between the High God of Justice Dipar, the Regent Court's Nerat and the Dwarven Goddess Avellind. One philosopher has argued that the High Gods, with their legacies of High Temples and the wisdom contained within, are unique and thus cannot be compared to the absent gods of the dwarves and Cannorians. Others respond that the similarities between these gods indicate that they are the same part of a greater divinity, with different facets shown to different groups of people."

Both institutions require a certain level of loyalty and obedience from their members, the state enforcing those values with laws while the family does so through personal bonds. No state represents the oneness of state and family better than the Hobgoblin Command. Their philosophy of Godlost is said to be inspired by the teachings of High Philosophy, particularly the school of Orange Sash. While imitation is indeed a form of flattery, these creeds diverge concerning this same principle of family and state. The hobgoblins argue that there is no greater family than the state itself, and thus loyalty to the state should triumph over any other form of loyalty. Meanwhile, the Orange Sash stresses that the core family is the most important structure, as the parents that raised you and the siblings that grew up alongside you should know better about you than the state could ever hope for."

But it will happen, and that's what being a mortal means.\n\nFor the followers of High Philosophy, what happens after death is not of particular concern. Their primary goal is to reach spiritual unity with the High Gods - Purtara. If one hasn't led a sufficiently righteous life, their souls will persist in the mortal realm until they finish walking the path to Purtara. The conclusion to the path of Nitikamarja and when one can be deemed righteous enough to achieve Purtara is however a matter of debate among philosophers. Many argue that when one has done enough good deeds and led a good life on earth, their path to Purtara is all but guaranteed even before their death. Others however point out that someone who had done numerous good deeds can stray from the path of Nitikamarja. They concluded that whether someone will reach Purtara is a question of the entire righteous life lived.. Thus, the end of one's atma and the fate of the self can only be truly known at the moment of their death."

Some look to the teaching of the High Gods, while others believe that meditation can help people to find their own understanding of morality. This particular opinion is primarily espoused by the Ascendant Soul school of High Philosophy. They further argue that morality is only concerned with the self, as Nitikamarja is a path achieved by doing the best for one's own atma. Others reject this notion, arguing that sometimes what is the best for the self can invite misery, as it is in defiance of what is best for the greater atma of the world – Visvatma. Therefore, sometime it serves the best interest of the community to do the right thing for the Visvatma."

 flavor_pasiragha.241.d:0 "Despite being the focus of High Philosophy, High Gods still conceal many mysteries that continue to elude us. The High Temples told us everything we know about them - yet nothing can be said about who they truly are. The earliest form of Raheni belief, the Devimarja, saw the High Gods as beings to worship and pray to. They believed that the High Gods were entirely separate from the common man, possessing certain divine and incommunicable properties. Meanwhile, the events of the First Council of Sardiphadin that formed the earliest shape of High Philosophy demoted the High Gods from their divine status. They were now seen as beings of no more innate wisdom than a normal human, but able to achieve something that most philosophers dreamt of - reaching spiritual unity after death, also known as Purtara. The distinction spurs a number of arguments, mainly concerning whether common people can be equated to the High Gods or whether they possess any incommunicable properties other than being the first to reach Purtara. This debate has raged since the First Council of Sardiphadin, continued in the Council of Dakhilamvi, and now the Hall of Rayavashapal gets its chance to weigh in on the matter."

They willingly give up some of their freedom in return for the safety provided and guaranteed by their government. Every person is thus morally bound to fulfill their role in society to maintain order and prevent terrible things happening.  A society without some kind of social contract would be an uncivilized society where it is every man for themselves. Raheni society has long based itself on these foundational truths.\n\nHowever, another idea has increasingly challenged this notion over the centuries. Rules generally restrict the freedom of the people, and that strict ordering of society breeds tyranny and oppression. While some form of order is necessary, such Naturalists concede,  people nevertheless have certain inalienable rights that cannot be taken away by any means. Order should come from people's own desire to live a good life, not because the government told them so."

They argue that only with power and strength can the self truly influence atma the way it sees fit. Strength is the ultimate expression of the self, as a strong individual cannot be bent to the will of others. While this is the common belief held by the followers of the Unbroken Claw, others argue that this is just a justification for the tyrannous to bend others to their will. They point out that many lords simply use the pretense provided by the school to oppress those who are weaker than themselves, in all obvious defiance of beneficial atma. Unbroken Claw scholars of course vociferously deny this, and routinely challenge their rivals to debates, or preferably to fights, to prove the correctness of their cause."

Icons  are expressions of religious art, such as paintings, monuments, ritual items or busts, often depicting the High Gods or other important people or events in High Philosophy. The school believes that in order to truly portray the greatness of the High Gods, religious icons must be made from the finest material, as if the Gods themselves made it.

Not only was he influential in the matter of religion, Suhan was a champion of reform for Raheni society, which he viewed as in dire need of change befitting the turn of the new era. He despised the caste system, as he thought of it as an attempt for one group to discriminate against and oppress the others. He supported the enfranchisement of women, especially in Orange Sash societies, as he believed that women are just as capable as men of reaching enlightenment and achieving Purtara from their own merit.\n\nIt is clear that he had profound impacts on Rahen and High Philosophy, and some of his followers have subsequently begun to believe that  Guru Suhan was more than a mere harimari, perhaps even an aspect of the High Gods. Others argue that Suhan was a man with great wisdom, but still a mortal nonetheless. They claim that Guru Suhan had achieved Purtara, but chose to deny it as he deemed himself to be unready to join the High Gods, and so any attempts to elevate him would go against what Suhan believed himself."

On the other hand, justice should also be blind, not looking beyond the action of the criminal.

Several disputes sprung up following the canonization of Tarphenday's thoughts by his followers, which led to schisms that birthed the schools of Starry Eyes and Ascendant Soul.\n\nWhile there are some arguments regarding atma, most of the differences between the schools lie in their interpretations of the proper aim of mortal existence - Kartya. Each school has differing opinions on what a mortal should do to achieve spiritual unity. Many such distinctions can be understood from the context of the time during which schools were formed, and certain events also influenced the way a school's thought was formed. In a way, the split between the schools could be understood as petty disagreements over matters not relating to the philosophy itself. On the other hand, we could conceptualise each school as a genuine attempt to find the true path to Purtara, and thus conclude that only by understanding the reason for the existence of each school will we gain their wisdom."

 flavor_pasiragha.300.t:0 "Aftermath of the Rebellion"
 flavor_pasiragha.300.d:0 "Rahen burns as the Blood Lotus rebels sweep the entire region. While all the guerilla armies have been hunted down and the Raj has enforced peace once again, philosophers have gathered in the Hall of Endless Debate to discuss the nature of this rebellion. One camp of philosophers argues that mass revolts are indicative of the failure of leaders to maintain harmony among the people they lead. A wise leader would be able to inspire confidence and unity among the populace. They should also be able to guide its citizens to fulfill their roles in society to maintain the balance of atma of the world, guidance which clearly failed during the onset of the Blood Lotus Rebellion.\n\nThat argument has received heavy backlash among the more progressive philosophers. Centuries of oppression has led the humans of the Harimraj to be dissatisfied with the system created against their best interest, they argue. The Harimari continue to pretend that everything is fine while enjoying the privileges only afforded to the Upper Caste. They further argue that if the Raj continues to ignore the aspirations of its human subjects and takes the wrong lesson from this revolt, it is all but guaranteed that future Blood Lotus revolts will continue to erupt, and more blood will be shed in the fields of Rahen."

 flavor_pasiragha.301.t:0 "Aftermath of the Rending"
 flavor_pasiragha.301.d:0 "The High Temples are destroyed, and the Great Spirits, long forgotten or even dismissed as myths, roam the material plane once again. The events of the so-called Rending of the Realms have brought devastation all across Haless. As the temples are slowly repaired and the lands warded once more against spirit activity, philosophers have begun discussing the cause of the disaster. Many argue that the people of Haless had strayed from the path of the High Gods, and thus the Rending served as a divine punishment. Lords were too concerned with power, influence, and wealth and neglected their goal of reaching Purtara, and thus caused the Visvatma to fall out of balance.\n\nWhile the arguments hold certain merits, others follow a more pragmatic view that it is the direct actions of  mortals that caused the disaster to happen. Recent findings have shown that the High Temples served as a ward against the Great Spirits. However, our greed enabled the gnomes to extract the core of the High Temples that we were supposed to maintain, weakening its power against spirits. The actions of the Oni also certainly contributed to this, but it was still the fault of mortals regardless."
 flavor_pasiragha.301.a:0 "It was a heavenly punishment"
 flavor_pasiragha.301.b:0 "It was a man made disaster" 
 flavor_pasiragha.302.t:0 "The Cinnabar Lotus Society"
 flavor_pasiragha.302.d:0 "Started as a small gathering between six like-minded philosophers, the Cinnabar Lotus Society has quickly grown as it attracts progressive philosophers into its ranks. The Society has gained so many followers, in fact, that there is no hall in Endhuvi big enough to accommodate the influx; they are instead forced to use great barges on the Kharunyana. The Cinnabar Lotus Society aims to encourage new ideas and revolutionary thinking that might reshape the landscape of philosophy in Haless. The Society welcomes High Philosophers and Praxists alike, as they believe that truly great ideas can only be born out of the exchange of great minds, regardless of their background. In the same vein, lectures held by the society are welcoming to citizens without considerations of their caste, allowing great thinkers to rise from unlikely places.\n\nThe Cinnabar Lotus Society has thus quickly become second only to the Hall of Endless Debates in its prestige. It is the sponsor of the foremost educational institutions in the eastern part of the Raj, accommodating people who cannot make the arduous journey to Rayavashapal. Philosophers of the Hall are curious to learn and gain insight from their perspective, and it would serve us best if we invite one of the members of the Society to give seminars in the Hall of Endless Debate."
