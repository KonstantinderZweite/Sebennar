 flavor_swi.2.t:0 "Swiss Pikemen"
 flavor_swi.2.d:0 "Swiss soldiers hired themselves out as mercenaries in many European nations. They were known for their discipline and drill with pike and halberd, but by the end of the sixteenth century had adopted the arquebus, and even mounted soldiers armed with arquebuses. Swiss pikemen were ruthless on the battlefield. They were known to hang their own men for panicking, for giving no quarter to enemies who surrendered, and for loyalty as long as they were paid. The phrase, "No silver, no Swiss," referred to the price of their loyalty, and the consequences of not paying them."

 castilian_civil_war_mod.1.b:0 "Support Isabella"
 castilian_civil_war_mod.1.d:0 "During the past century the Castillian nobility have time and time again actively tried to interfere with the succession of the Castillian crown and have not flinched from allying outside powers. With the untimely death of $MONARCH$ , a new battle seems to be brewing and the succession is again in question. Some nobles would prefer that $MONARCH$'s half-sister Isabella would rule and seek aid from the Kingdom of Aragon, while others back his only daughter Joanna 'la Beltraneja', suspected bastard of the Duke of Alburquerque, with backing from Portugal. Things have now spiraled into open conflict and it seems increasingly likelythat the faction without royal support will attempt to put their candidate directly on the throne rather than queue for it. Some parts of the nobility remain undecided yet, and some have chosen this opportunity to protest against perceived infringements of their old rights in general."
