 G79_appease_the_north_title:0 "Appease the North"
 G79_appease_the_north_desc:0 "Though just a decade ago it had seemed Enlarmai would be the hegemon of Larankar, Erankar of Urvand has somehow managed to claw back his city's power - now, Erankar's Larankarha Kingdom is quickly proving itself the hegemon of northern Taychend. With our expansion in the east and south, we have not yet crossed our spears with their sabres. Some Taychendi consider allies a sign of weakness - they have probably never been cornered by two jaguars seeking their prey together. Only time will tell how soon the jaguars will jump at their own throats."

 G79_consolidate_the_cape_title:0 "Consolidate the Cape"
 G79_consolidate_the_cape_desc:0 "Our domain stretches from the tip of Thekvussam cape to the north, along the Kila Toram, at the very eastern edge of Taychend. The lands we rule are rich and on crossroads of many important trade routes - the Old Loop, the Path of Wine and the Straight Road. To our west, beyond the petty kingdoms of Sthanan ith Vussam and Nagar Vyechei, Kheionai of Ameion have landed and began their invasion. If we want to become more than just a passing wind in annals of history, we must unite the Thekvussam."
 G79_consolidate_the_cape_effect_G81_yes_tt:0 "£yes£ If [G81.GetName] meets the requirements, [Root.GetName] will instantly integrate them, losing 4 £dip£ per point of development in '§YSibisimra§!', '§YTirsin§!', '§YNagarchend§!', '§YSthanan ith Vussam§!' and '§YVuls Tenvach§!' areas and 8 £dip£ per point of development outside of them.\n"

 G79_look_into_the_sky_title:0 "Look Into the Sky"
 G79_look_into_the_sky_desc:0 "To the south of our capital, just north of the tip of Thekvussam, lie the rugged hills of Uyarbaid. There live hill tribes of Yodhanpir descent, whom we have not yet fully integrated into [Root.GetName]. They are a peculiar bunch, worshipping great storms that frame the cape and storm serpents that live in them. In their villages they revere strange powerful relics that can create localised storms and control weather. While our cooperation with them has been loose until now, should we integrate them, we will be able to wield this fearsome power for our own goals."
 G79_look_into_the_sky_ei_tt:0 "\n§GEvent Insight§!\nWhether through cooperation or assimilation of tribes living in hills of Uyarbaid, we have come  into contact with ancient relics, allowing us to manipulate and harness the power of storms that surround the Thekvussam Cape."

 G79_taking_a_stand_title:0 "Taking a Stand"
 G79_taking_a_stand_desc:0 "The Kheionai of Ameion think they can invade our lands, raze our cities and kill our people! This cannot stand. The haughty mages of Nagar Vyechei, the ailing remnants of the Gophiran Empire, the weak scholars of Sthanan ith Vussam - all of them crumbled against Laskaris' might. Some Taychendi are even whispering that this atheist is destined for ascension! We must put an end to their incursion and wrestle back the reins of fate they claim to have been gifted. Taychend suffers no interloper!"

 G79_cut_fate_short_title:0 "Cut Fate Short"
 G79_cut_fate_short_desc:0 "The oracle of Korrimutern foretold that Laskaris shall become a great conqueror who will rule over Taychend and forge a great empire. Many believe these prophecies and cower in fear before Kheionai invaders. Yet fate is a fickle thing - the oracle may believe it will be written as it was told, but we know better - fate is but a shapeless clay that can be moulded into whatever form a skilled artisan wishes. He only needs a chisel and a hammer - determination and will to fight."
 G79_cut_fate_short_trigger_tt:0 "Ameion:\n      All §Yowned province(s)§! in the §YInitial Invasion§! province group are controlled by §Y[Root.GetName]§!."
 G79_cut_fate_short_ei_tt:0 "\n§GEvent Insight§!\nWith Ameioni troops defeated by us and their initial invasion halted, Kheionai invaders have to fall back from their holdings in Taychend. The question remains: how shall our victory be remembered among our Taychendi brethren?"

 G79_cut_fate_short_effect_peace_tt:0 "If we complete this mission by owning key provinces:"

 G79_brother_against_brother_title:0 "Brother Against Brother"
 G79_brother_against_brother_desc:0 "The tensions among the half-Kheionai and adherents to Taychendi traditions have reached the tipping point and only bloodshed can ease them. No matter the side that wins, it is certain they will strongarm our state so it is reshaped in their image. What shall be the fate of [Root.GetName]? Only the field of battle knows the answer to that question. We must weather the storm."
 G79_brother_against_brother_trigger_tt:0 "Have finished the Civil War between Traditionalists and Half-Kheionai"

 G79_subjugate_the_bandits_title:0 "Subjugate the Bandits"
 G79_subjugate_the_bandits_desc:0 "In Taychend your worth is proven by your deeds, not your inheritance, yet when looking at Sibisimra it is hard not to feel disgust - for they are nothing more than bandits that claimed a city. These honourless outlaws scour the lands north to us and disrupt the flow of trade with Yodhandchend. They back up their claims with delusions of grandeur, believing themselves successors of an empire. Perhaps they forgot that it was we who broke their realm. Bandits care only for two things when choosing their leaders - strength and coin. Let us show them we have both aplenty and they may yet be of use to us."
 G79_subjugate_the_bandits_effect_tt:0 "Disable the '§YVolisi Vara Bandit Swordsmen§!' Mercenary Company for every other country"

 G79_breadbasket_of_the_south_title:0 "Breadbasket of the South"
 G79_breadbasket_of_the_south_desc:0 "Stormy clouds of Thekvussam are a danger at seas, but the swirling warm air that flows from them to the shores of the cape, combined with fertile lands of Tirsin and Vuls Tenvach, provides a perfect climate for developing agriculture. Yet constant warfare in the area has never allowed us to fully tap into the potential these farmlands can bring. Developing fortified granaries inside of temples should help with protecting the surplus of food for our armies - after all, an army marches on its stomach."

 G79_rule_thekvussam_title:0 "Rule the Thekvussam"
 G79_rule_thekvussam_desc:0 "Outsiders may think that Thekvussam is just a small piece of land, yet they do not understand its nature. Cape Thekvussam is not just the cape itself, but also waves that relentlessly buffet the rocks on beaches, swirling dark clouds that brighten with lightning arcs and the wind that carries taste of salt to our tongues. We cannot call ourselves rules of Thekvussam if we were to only take hold of the land. To rule Thekvussam we must rule the seas around it as well."
 G79_rule_thekvussam_hired_ships_tt:0 "If we complete this mission while having '§YHired Private Ships§!' country modifier:"
 G79_rule_thekvussam_hired_ships_ct_tt:0 "§YHired Private Ships§! will be removed from [Root.GetName]."

 G79_calm_before_the_storm_title:0 "Calm Before the Storm"
 G79_calm_before_the_storm_desc:0 "Our sailors strike out to  sea when torrential rains hit the wooden decks and winds howls in their ears. They do so for they know the danger that awaits them; they see their enemy and can react to its strikes. There is nothing as dangerous as a calm sea to a Thekvrystana sailor - in one second it appears to lull the crew, just to end lives innumerable with one powerful strike of lightning. We should let our enemies sleep… let them forget the fury the South can unleash."
 G79_calm_before_the_storm_effect_tt:0 "§YEvery known country§! with §Ycapital§! in §YTaychend§! superregion will lose §G-15.00§! aggresive expansion against §Y[Root.GetName]§!."

 G79_clear_the_clouded_skies_title:0 "Clear the Clouded Skies"
 G79_clear_the_clouded_skies_desc:0 "The more we conquer the more we spread ourselves thin. If there is anything we have learned from the histories the Violet Brotherhood kept, it is that loyalties change and the path to become a foe is easy to traverse for a “friend”. We have experienced it first hand when half-Kheionai and adherents to tradition in our kingdom incited a civil war. Like a skilled sailor seeing stormy clouds on the horizon we must avoid trouble. Contrary to them, we shall clear these clouds from the sky ourselves."
 G79_clear_the_clouded_skies_effect_tt:0 "Lose §G10§! years of separatism in §YEvery owned province§!."

 G79_heir_of_conquerors_title:0 "Heirs of Conquerors"
 G79_heir_of_conquerors_desc:0 "Our knowledge does not come from reading dusty old  tomes, nor does it come from philosophical debates. What we know is what we have learned through action - through mistakes of ourselves and those who came before us. We have bested the Kheionai invaders, we destroyed the remnants of the Gophiran empire, the Blue House is subservient to us and only a scant few still avoid our rule. The greatest lesson they have taught us? As long as opposition exists it shall be a nuisance. And so they must perish."
 G79_heir_of_conquerors_ei_tt:0 "\n§GEvent Insight§!\nOur continued study of the weather-altering relics left by Slaver-Nobles has proven useful. Our Mages assure us that latent magical energy found in them can be used to unleash a storm of unimaginable proportions that will sweep through all of Taychend."

 G79_ameioni_lessons_title:0 "Ameioni Lessons"
 G79_ameioni_lessons_desc:0 "The Ameioni were bested by us, but not without losses on our side. Their professional phalanx routinely bested our levies and if it was not for our zeal and personal bravery, they surely would have laid us low. Times change and we cannot hope for heroes to rise through our ranks once again. We must take inspiration from the Kheionai invaders and rethink our armies - no more shall peasants take up arms before they learn how to swing them, no more shall we send them into the battle without teaching them how personal glory intertwines with the discipline of trained infantry."
 G79_ameioni_lessons_effect_tt:0 "Up to §Y10§! provinces which have a §YManpower Building§! built gain §G1§! Base Manpower."

 G79_echoes_of_storm_title:0 "Echoes of Storm"
 G79_echoes_of_storm_desc:0 "The skies have closed and the rain has stopped. Murmurs of a terrifying typhoon have subsided and left silence in their wake, broken sparingly by nature coming back to life. The [Root.GetAdjective] storm has surprised even the warlords, who thought they could shelter themselves from the storm that will engulf their lands. What the storm has razed shall form the packed rubble upon which a new power shall rise, and the valleys of Taychend shall echo the sound of our thunderous advance!"
 G79_echoes_of_storm_effect_tt:0 "Declaring a war while at peace, grants '§YThunderous Advance§!' for §Y18 months§!, giving the following effects:\nMovement Speed: §G+20.0%§!\nFleet Movement Speed: §G+2.00§!\n\nWinning war, while this modifier is active, gives §G50§! Splendor, §G5.0§! Army Tradition, §G5.0§! Navy Tradition and removes §G-2.00§! War Exhaustion (separate peaces do not count)."

 G79_mastery_of_commerce_title:0 "Mastery of Commerce"
 G79_mastery_of_commerce_desc:0 "If there is one thing that can turn a sword, it is a coin. The clattering of coins in a pouch can turn the wildest of scowls into a friendly grin and transform the dreams of unfulfilled glory into complacency. Many warlords of Taychend were rich, taking spoils and relics as personal rewards - yet this only led to a greater hunger inside of those soldiers who broke through the gates of walled cities too late. If we want our empire to last, we must ensure the flow of goods - and coin - remains uninterrupted."
 G79_mastery_of_commerce_tsr_req_tt:0 "If we complete the mission by improving provinces belonging to §YThe Straight Road§!:"
 G79_mastery_of_commerce_tsr_eff_tt:0 "§YEvery subject country§! cedes §Yevery owned province§! belonging to §YThe Straight Road§! province group.\nUpon forming §YTaychendi Empire§!, §YOrenvalyam§! or §YValidaunéa§! get '§YMasters of the Straight Road§!' until the end of the game, giving the following effects:\nCaravan Power: §G+30.0%§!"

 G79_the_taken_port_title:0 "The Taken Port"
 G79_the_taken_port_desc:0 "Orenkoraim controls the vital estuary of the Kalavend river, controlling the trade that flows in and out of Northern Taychend, while also extending their arm for the goods travelling alongside the shores of Taychend. Orenkoraimi like to think of their little island as “untaken” - but with the power of our fleet and  the knowledge of siegecraft our Kheionai advisors have brought with them, we can put paid to this nickname forever."
 G79_the_taken_port_yes_effect_tt:0 "£yes£ If [6559.GetName] has both a §YDock Building§! and a §YShipyard Building§! built gain §G100.00§! Crowns.\n"

 G79_the_taken_port_ei_tt:0 "\n§GEvent Insight§!\nAfter years of careful cooperation, a new era on Taychendi seas dawns. With Kheionai blueprints in hand, [Root.GetName] is prepared to build its first Degárikes. Two ships would test their skill; future expansion would test their resolve. "

 G79_control_the_islands_title:0 "Control the Islands"
 G79_control_the_islands_desc:0 "When we first fought against Ameion we faced a hegemon, with mortal spears, but a shield of fate. The hegemon failed, fell under the weight of its own hubris, yet still it controlled the seas of Taychend. Now our navy is ready to take the fight to the Kheionai, equipped with the very weapons they themselves brought to Taychend. We cannot just become Kheionai; we must be better than them, learning from their arts to create something they never could - an empire that shall last."

 G79_the_greatest_ship_title:0 "The Greatest Ship"
 G79_the_greatest_ship_desc:0 "The dreaded Degárikes - massive warships of Kheionai make - have finally been harnessed by us. Our shipyard in [2520.GetName] is bigger and more perfect than the Kheionai could ever imagine, able to produce multiple of these titans at once. Yet seeing the power we wield with these ships, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] cannot help but wonder - are Kheionai designs the limit of what can be created? Can we launch what they never could? A vessel so large that shores themself shall tremble with the echoes of its weapons..."
 G79_the_greatest_ship_effect_tt:0 "Get a new §YHeavy Ship§! flagship named §YDeyodéikakaupos§! in §Y[2520.GetName]§!.\n\nUnlocks the §YRaise Deyodéikakaupos§! Decision, allowing us to recreate this Titan of the Seas, should it ever get destroyed."

 G79_great_house_enshrined_title:0 "Great House Enshrined"
 G79_great_house_enshrined_desc:0 "Vuls Tenvach means a “Great House”. Truly our name reflects who we are - for we do not cut down those who oppose us and destroy them. We grasp their weapons and like a good father stow them away so they do not hurt themselves. Many Taychendi do not see our vision yet, but they soon shall;  only by all becoming part of the Great House will Taychend  unite. It shall be their choice, whether we greet them with open arms or with a whip in our hands."
 G79_great_house_enshrined_effect_tt:0 "Every subject country will transfer §G1§! random point of development from its capital to our capital.\n\nIf §YGlory Level§! of [Root.Monarch.GetName] is at least equal to §YGrowing Legend (Level 3)§! this effect will happen twice.\n\nIf §YGlory Level§! of [Root.Monarch.GetName] is at least equal to §YGlorious Sovereign (Level 5)§! this effect will happen three times."

 G79_artists_of_taychend_title:0 "Artists of Taychend"
 G79_artists_of_taychend_desc:0 "The Thekvrystana are a curious bunch of Taychendi. They do not ride fearsome beasts to battle, nor are they masters of arms. What differentiates them from others is how they channel their passion outside of war, outside of battle, and create glory by other means. The brilliance of Nanru Nakar, the sublime beauty of Nagar Vyechei, even the newly created mosaics of Kottar Orenkoraim, all these cities have employed artists originating from our homelands. Why should our people decorate foreign palaces when we ourselves are worthy of their works?"

 G79_empire_of_cities_title:0 "Empire of Cities"
 G79_empire_of_cities_desc:0 "Many kingdoms and empires that rose in Taychend were centred around the manors and ruins left behind by the Slaver-Nobles. Each collapsed and was destroyed because of how such “empires” took care of their inheritance, squatting among rubble, half-collapsed mansions and reinforcing them with scraps of metal and stone. Our empire shall be different - the cities will once again be full of life, like hearts supplied with precious blood through the veins of our carefully maintained trade routes."
 G79_empire_of_cities_ei_tt:0 "\n§GEvent Insight§!\nCaravans flowing in and out, every single one carrying unimaginable riches. With our fatherly care, we have turned the Straight Road into the greatest trade route in all of Taychend."

 flavour_vulstenvach.1.t:0 "Clear Skies"
 flavour_vulstenvach.1.d:0 "Lying on the intersection of the Straight Road and the Path of Wine, the [Root.GetAdjective] [Root.GovernmentName] saw the Kheionai invasion as both a looming danger and an enticing opportunity. Protected by the rugged hills of Uyarbaid to the south from the armies of Ameion, and by the terrifying storms off Thekvussam Cape from Laskaris' navy, their remote location provided a natural shield. Yet, it was the unmatched expertise in navigating these treacherous waters that positioned [Root.GetAdjective] sailors to broker mutually beneficial trade with the blue-skinned invaders.\n\nOver the years, the ports of Thekvussam, Curiyankad, and most importantly Korrimadhala began to bustle with Kheionai merchants and sailors. These invaders, viewed with suspicion elsewhere in Taychend, found a warmer reception in [Root.GetName], their presence growing steadily as trade flourished. Jointly crewed by Thekvrystana and Ambhen sailors, the ships carried valuable goods from distant corners of the Andeios, enriching [Root.GetName] in both wealth and influence. The upper class, accustomed to novelty, gradually embraced the Kheionai presence, and the young [Root.Heir.GetTitle] [Root.Heir.GetName] was particularly captivated, taking a keen interest in the culture and allure of Kheionai women."

 flavour_vulstenvach.2.t:0 "Gathering Storm"
 flavour_vulstenvach.2.d:0 "While the ports of [Root.GetName] brimmed with wealth from Kheionai trade, not everyone warmly welcomed these blue-skinned newcomers. As Kheionai sailors and merchants took up residence in the once-familiar markets, many citizens grew uneasy, viewing the foreign presence as a threat to their tradition. Rumours spread that Kheionai influence reached far beyond commerce, insidiously embedding itself into the very heart of [Root.GetAdjective] society.\n\nThese tensions were only fueled by the actions of the young Alvardip, whose fascination with Kheionai culture went well beyond simple curiosity. Known for his romantic escapades, he had pursued multiple Kheionai women, setting tongues wagging among the nobles and common folk alike. This scandal deepened when one of his Kheionai lovers gave birth to a child, a boy whose lineage was neither wholly Thekvrystana nor fully Kheionai. The boy's name was Olorises."

 flavour_vulstenvach.3.d:0 "The spire standing in the middle of the village was unremarkable at first glance, until a watchful gaze carefully studied its base and saw the visible blue veins of magic, dancing on the surface. The leader of the tribe, visibly older than [Root.Monarch.GetName], a veteran of many fights, attentively heard what the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] had said.\n\n“What shall we get in return for this cooperation, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]? Why don't you just come and seize what you wish? Why don't you kill us and destroy what we revere?”\n\n“We won't do so not because we need you, but because you need us. Why raid farming villages if you could conquer cities? Why burn palisades of wood, if you could raze walls of stone? Why be content with squabbling among yourselves, infighting with other tribes of these hills, when you could march side by side with us, bolts of lightning above our heads heralding our ascent. Why rule villages, when together we could rule an empire?”\n\nThe leader weighed the words of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and after a brief moment of silence responded “Very well, we shall fight on your side. Let us wield the storms together” -  he extended his arm."

 flavour_vulstenvach.4.d:0 "As [Root.GetAdjective] armies enter yet another city occupied by Kheionai invaders, the resistance is visibly weaker. Those few Kheionai and their Taychendi allies who still retain the loyalty to the Ambhen Synkletos fight to the bitter end, aware they shall be given no quarter. The food is no longer delivered with [Root.GetName] controlling the southern coast of Taychend in its entirety, effectively severing the connection between Ameion and its conquests, carved from Taychend after Laskaris' invasion.\n\nEven after days and weeks have passed the armies of Ameion are nowhere to be seen. Seldomly, a vessel flying Ameioni colours comes close enough to see the coast and is greeted with a hail of arrows from the shore, sent flying by watchmen. Soon enough, even these vessels disappear and the silence of southern Taychend gives way to the hum of everyday life - without the Kheionai chain crippling it. Only silent whispers passed on by traders confirm what everyone thought - the war is over, Ameion has left their conquests. The very same whispers tell that [Root.Monarch.GetName] was declared an enemy of Ambhen - perhaps the greatest title a proud Taychendi  ruler could hope for.\n\nMany Taychendi look to us as great victors who have saved them from the terrible fate the Ambhen have prepared for them; yet with the invader gone, old loyalties are resurfacing. Our lot will be remembered by Taychendi to come, the question is, how shall they remember us?"

It is said 'the house divided against itself cannot stand', and this is true also of the Great House of Vuls Tenvach. As the Ambhen infiltrate the social fabric of Taychendi, their ideas and philosophies have ingrained into the mind of common folk and, perhaps more importantly, elites.\n\nBut those fools who fell to foreign ideas are no longer among us, having decided to betray the customs of the Taychendi and ally themselves with Ambhen invaders. As their power lies broken and they are left to lick their wounds as pariahs, the status of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has only strengthened, a powerful warlord ready to destroy all opposition. Already the neighbours of Vuls Tenvach cower in fear, as they hear of the victories of [Root.Monarch.GetName].

A new class has risen, composed of half-Kheionai and local Taychendi together, educated in the ways of the philosophers. First among them - Olorises. Once nothing more but a glory-seeker and adventurer, bastard to old Alvardip; now a strong monarch, wearing the helmet of Laskaris in place of a crown. To his left and his right a host of Kheionised elites, philosophers, generals. Having cleaned his sword, he did not wait two moments before launching into reform of old Taychendi institutions, proclaiming a new state of Degíthion - a Kheionist kingdom in Taychend - something better than the sum of its parts."

 flavour_vulstenvach.6.d:0 "The most important relics of Uyarbaid, each one a fragment of lost epochs imbued with the power of the storm-serpents, were arranged in a precise circle, glowing faintly with the promise of untapped power. The air around the ritual site hummed. At the centre stood the elder, whose ancestor and ancestor of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] met long ago. As they invoked the ancient words, the skies above turned an unnatural shade of black, thick and menacing, as though the skies themselves had been summoned to bend before the power of [Root.GetName].\n\nThunder rumbled in the distance, but it was not the ordinary call of a storm—it was the voice of something primal, something beyond this world. Lightning cracked through the clouds, not in erratic bolts, but in deliberate strikes, like the wrathful fingers of the gods reaching down. The winds began to whip furiously around the circle of relics, pulling at the earth and sending debris spiralling into the air.\n\nSuddenly, the storm above took shape—towering, whirling, and all-encompassing, a vortex of raw elemental fury. It churned and twisted, faster and faster, drawing in the very essence of the relics until, with a deafening roar, it erupted outward. The storm did not merely stay confined to the ritual site. It spread—first across the sky above Uyarbaid, then across the borders of the land, its reach endless, as if guided by an unseen hand. What was left at the ritual site was heavy, unnatural silence. But in the hearts of all who witnessed it, a deep fear and awe remained - a knowledge that the sky itself had been bent to the will of [Root.GetName], and from that day forward, no land would stand defiant without feeling the weight of the tempest ready to be summoned once more."

In the warm brilliance of the sun, reflected in the water of wells spotting the land of foreign capital, many Taychendi children played, reenacting the tales the priests told them with wooden swords and spears. Their laughter was cut short by cries of their concerned mothers. “Come home, children! The skies darken!”\n\nThey darkened - then, in one moment, they blackened. Droplets of rain like arrows struck the land beneath. Then, as quickly as it had arrived, the sound of the rain shifted from  pitter-patter to a thousand rattling snare-drums. None knows if the cries of concerned mothers and scared children continued, for they were drowned out by the overwhelming noise of nature's fury.\n\nThe rain poured out of the sky for a day and a night. Those lucky enough not to drown in the first hour were kept awake for days by the crashes of lightning striking the land beneath. When the sun's rays finally pierced the veil of clouds, the few survivors looked at their city in ruins, houses blasted by lightning and swept away by the rushing floods, and rivers of mud filling the streets. From underneath the debris, a broken wooden sword pointed towards the sky."

The shipwright's hands moved swiftly over the intricate plans, tracing lines and pointing out details that had, until now, been known only to the Kheionai of Alecand.\n\n“Two ships?” the shipwright asked, eyebrow raised, a flicker of doubt crossing his face. “You're certain [Root.GetAdjective] shipyards can handle this?”\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] leaned forward, his steel eyes meeting the Kheionai's gaze. “The men you trained are prepared. They understand the hull bracing and the ram support. You promised the best, and we're prepared to build them.”\n\nThe shipwright nodded thoughtfully, his finger tapping over the blueprint's outline of the Degárikes' colossal frame. “Even so, this is a start - two ships will challenge even your finest dockworkers. And after that? If you mean to rival the Kheionai, your ports are… insufficient.”\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] smirked, unphased. “Two ships are all I need to prove our capabilities. Once they're finished, we'll expand. Soon, we'll need no Kheionai shipyards to field our Degárikes.”\n\nThe shipwright let out a low, impressed whistle. “Then may the Cleaved Sea be warned,” he murmured, running a hand along the blueprint's edges. “I'll teach your builders the secrets of construction. But know this - there is no going back once you command these vessels.”\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] merely nodded - the Degárikes would be theirs, and soon, [Root.GetName] would sail a fleet powerful enough to rival all of Andeios."

Against the whiteness of marble walls, full of carved reliefs depicting regal storm-serpents attended by lesser sea creatures, here and there the darker figure of an artist with a chisel in their hand stood on tall scaffolding. Their colourful clothes were all whitened with the dust of marble falling on delicate material, which formed concentric circles, culminating in a tall throne.\n\n“Ah!” shouted the architect, his blue skin visibly contrasting with the background, “Your Highness, as you can see, the last elements are being readied; after those highest reliefs have been chiselled, we will need only to gild them in order to finish the throne room.” The architect glanced nervously at the dust falling from the relief. “Um, Your Highness, the dust in the air is bad for one's health. Should we move to the balcony?” he gestured away, inviting, to a wide balcony overseeing [2520.GetName].\n\nAs [Root.Monarch.GetName] came outside, he felt a light breeze on his skin and a taste of salt wafting in the air. Below him a street full of workers shaved infinitesimal pieces of cobblestone from a carefully measured main avenue, ensuring the carts travelling through it wouldn't lose any of their valuables. Winding streets of old had been cleared and corrected, reflecting the rational perfection of the new Kheionised elite who had moved into the city. The street below cut through the middle of the city, connecting the palace with a massive Kheion-style harbour. Using knowledge of eastern shipbuilding, a drydock had been constructed, the wooden skeleton of a new [Root.GetAdjective] Degárikes within. “And” asked the architect, “What do you think, your Highness?”"

To move in the crowd that attends marketplaces along the Straight Road is to follow a wave which surges from booth to booth, shelling out money from a sack carried on the belt.\n\nThat wave ripples as people quickly make way for a patrol of scouts, riding along the road, waiting for just a moment before the gates are opened and they ride off into the heart of Taychend, looking after the travellers of the road. Our efforts have borne this fruit, the fatherly care that nurtured the Straight Road, the Southern Arc, the Path of Wine and the cities alongside it into safe havens for weary travellers.\n\nSafe, secure, prosperous - just how we like it."

His insults were sharp, calling the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] a weakling, a coward unworthy of the throne. The brazenness of the act shocked many, but it was the violent aftermath that truly set the city on edge. Three Taychendi, loyal defenders of the hero they revered, stepped forward to put an end to the brawl, but they were no match for the supporters of the insulter. They were left bruised and barely alive, their pride shattered alongside their bodies.\n\nAs the conflict brewed, tensions simmered within the city's walls. The streets whispered of rebellion, and suspicions grew that this incident was not an isolated outburst but part of a larger, more sinister plan. Guards soon apprehended a blue-skinned fool, clutching a blue ribbon in his trembling hand. He was interrogated harshly, and only after the third strike did he finally break, admitting that he had been sent by the Ambhen Synkletos to fan the flames of half-Kheionai unrest in [Root.GetName]. Though small in number, these influential and wealthy traders could use their influence to undermine our rule.\n\nHis execution was swift and without ceremony. The blade fell, and his treachery was silenced, but the echoes of his actions had already rippled outwards. Though we managed to cut off many heads of the hydra before they could strike, some of them woke, enraged, and lashed back against us with renewed ferocity. Now, the time has come to strike the final blow - to cut off the last head of this beast that dares to threaten us."

None of them, however, remain alive today.\n\nThe battle against them was fierce and brutal. Each rebel was hunted down and each fought with the ferocity of a cornered beast. They were more than insurgents; they were symbols of defiance. But one by one, we silenced them. Now their bluish heads rest on spikes, mounted high on the western walls of the cities that housed them. The message is clear: betrayal will not be tolerated.\n\nTheir deaths mark the end of this particular uprising, but the spikes on the walls remain - a reminder to all who might consider rising against us. There is no glory in rebellion here, only death. Let the Kheionai and their sympathisers see the fate of those who challenge us and know that Vuls Tenvach's will is unbreakable.

Eager to outpace her competition and deliver goods faster, she chose to cut across the Sea of Ameion rather than hugging the coast, fully aware that it could shave days, if not weeks, off her journey. The voyage started swiftly, with fierce winds battering the sails of her Kheionai vessel. Meanwhile, seasoned local sailors watched anxiously, their eyes fixed on the ominous dark clouds gathering above.\n\nBefore long, gusts of wind started to shake the boat, as a violent storm started to rage around them. The torrential rain chilled the oarsmen as they rowed double-time to combat the fury of elements. In the chaos, Liandithe ran to Olorises' cradle, wishing to embrace her son one last time before the end. For a heartbeat time stopped, as she saw a blinding flash of light break the darkness of the storm, illuminating the deck and everyone on it. She saw both the terrified eyes of the young sailors, not yet ready to die, and she saw the resigned faces of the experienced sailors - and in this split second, she also saw a crackling lightning pierce the sky, an arrow aimed at  the cradle of her son. For a moment the flash blinded her  and a resounding boom deafened her. As whiteness gave way to sight, she opened her eyes to find Olorises still in his cradle, unscathed, with only a small crown-shaped scar on his sternum as a memoir of the fateful encounter.\n\nAfter the lightning struck, the skies cleared and the ship made it to Ameion unharmed. From then on, none of the journeys of Liandithe could proceed without Olorises on the ship, the sailors believing his mere presence was enough to make a safe journey through storm-ridden seas."

They perceive themselves as glorious, yet they are ashamed of the fragility of their lives and spend their days in pursuit of cheap thrills...” - the long oration of the Kheionai philosopher, a new advisor to Olorises, had only just begun. Hailing from distant Alecand, the philosopher had come to evangelise these new and powerful eastern adherents to Kheionai philosophy.  Many of the elites of the Bastard Prince listened intently, as the speaker sought to dismantle the falsehoods of Taychendi religion.\n\nOlorises, weary of the oration, suddenly stood up. “And what does it matter why they fight, speaker? ” - the prince's words clearly shook the philosopher, unaccustomed to his students questioning him. “Some Taychendi may live in fear of death. They run from it for so long that they forget the source of their fear. But they do not run toward the safety of the Kheions, terrified of winds carrying sand. Nor do they flee back to their Nekhéis, afraid of the depths of Devand. When the Taychendi run from the void of death, they trample the corpses of the adversaries they've felled! They run in the panoply of battle, to escape the long arm of death through their glorious deeds. Does it matter if they run, if they have achieved what the Kheionai never could? If they fear death, when they are always prepared to face its cold embrace? If they believe in their gods, when their actions would be just glorious as if they scorned them?\n\nThink about that, speaker. I do not know what awaits me after I die, but even in death, my fame will echo in the ears of my descendants. One day, death shall conquer my body...”"
