haless_and_aelantir_monuments_heiyukcheng.1.d: "Just after we had put the final touches on the expansion of the Black Jade Citadel of Heiyukcheng, a small delegation of rather unusual people arrived. They introduced themselves as representatives of the Eternal Council, a group of vampiric undead sorcerers that formerly ruled from the Black Temple of Jincheng. In exchange for being allowed the freedom to operate within our state, they are offering their services to us as vampires. Should we take them up on this offer?"
haless_and_aelantir_monuments_heiyukcheng.1.a: "We shall let the seeds of darkness fester..."
haless_and_aelantir_monuments_heiyukcheng.1.b: "Vampires? Outrageous. Guards, arrest this delegation at once!"
haless_and_aelantir_monuments_heiyukcheng.1.c: "Vampires? What does he mean? We already have vampires!"
haless_and_aelantir_monuments_heiyukcheng.1.e: "What is he talking about? We, The Eternal Council, are still in power!"
