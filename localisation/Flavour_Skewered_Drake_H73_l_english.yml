 flavor_skewered_drake.1.d:0 "In the ruins of Gor Vazumbrog do we of the Skewered Drake clan rule our kingdom, built on the ruins of foolhardy dwarves and ancient magical miasma. We have claimed this harsh place with the aid of the Drakons, our constant companions and namesake of the tribe. These purple-scaled quadripedal reptiles serve as mounts for the greatest of our warriors, their rending claws and snapping jaws making short work of any foolish enough to stand against us."
