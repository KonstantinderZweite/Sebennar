 L37_launch_an_investigation_title:0 "Launch an Investigation"
 L37_launch_an_investigation_desc:0 "While the assassin may be dead, he left much evidence behind. Tools, places he stayed, and his body itself may offer us clues as to who sent him. We shall hire the greatest detectives in the realm, and they shall scour all the Isles for leads. The culprits will be found, no matter where they hide!"
 L37_seek_spiritual_aid_title:0 "Seek Spiritual Aid"
 L37_seek_spiritual_aid_desc:0 "Across Fahvanosy, shrines profess devotion to the various gods of the Great Family and thus their opposition to those who would abandon it. They are our natural allies against the cults that currently infest our realm and furthermore have a duty to defend the people. They can both calm those who fear the intervention of evil powers and use their religious training to root out the heretics, whether that be by persuasion or force. "
 L37_breach_the_walls_title:0 "Breach the Walls"
 L37_breach_the_walls_desc:0 "While our lands may be the geographic center of Fahvanosy, there is no doubt that Lelanán is its spiritual heart. It is the largest city of the isles and marks a serious roadblock to our northern conquests. We must take it, even if it mars our relationship with the powerful priestess of Lel. They will forgive us, just as the Goddess does."
 L37_prepare_a_holy_war_title:0 "Prepare a Holy War"
 L37_prepare_a_holy_war_desc:0 "While some speak of peacefully bringing the servants of the dark back into the fold, this will be impossible until their military power is crushed and our missionaries can move freely.  We must assemble an army, the greatest ever seen in Fahvanosy, and march into the jungles. If any resist our occupation of the villages, they will be killed. Mercy cannot be permitted for those who betray their families and murder one of the greatest monarchs the Isles have ever known."
 L37_cult_vanquished_title:0 "Cult Vanquished"
 L37_cult_vanquished_desc:0 "It is done. The traitors, to the kingdom, to the Vzemby people, and to the gods themselves have been defeated. Their cults have been militarily and spiritually crushed, and the Isles are once again religiously harmonious. Our people have been reminded that the family of the Vyzemby people on Halann, just as with the Great Family above, always sticks together. Mihitarab, of course, serves as the loving parent, rooting out those who would tear it apart."
 L37_era_of_peace_and_prosperity_title:0 "Era of Peace and Prosperity"
 L37_era_of_peace_and_prosperity_desc:0 "Our monarch's name means “Queen of Prayer”, and the Great Family has certainly answered ours. The government is well run, the harvests are bountiful, and even the barks of our hounds seem less aggressive. All of our people, from the lowest peasant to the highest noble, contentedly feast. Life, however, continues, and tensions with our neighbors persist. Haingo, the son of our queen, leads a court faction arguing for the use of our favorable position to “resolve” these disputes in our favor, though the Queen has not yet accepted their advice."
 L37_fomarati_king_title:0 "Fomarati King"
 L37_fomarati_king_desc:0 "Mihitarab has long been preeminent over both Fomarati people and the Vyzemby as a whole, but has never before experienced the power it does today. While some outlying islands still escape our grasp, there is no organized opposition left against our dominance of the west coast of Sovalenosy. We can now call ourselves not just §ga§! Fomarati kingdom, but §gthe§! kingdom of the Fomarati."
 L37_the_south_kneels_title:0 "The South Kneels"
 L37_the_south_kneels_desc:0 "While our water-dogs are certainly a major breeding achievement, even we must admit that no halfling has ever bred better wardogs than the Mboala. This, however, did not save them, and we have roundly defeated them on the field of battle. All that now remains is for them to make their formal oaths of loyalty to the King. "
 L37_cities_of_the_north_title:0 "Cities of the North"
 L37_cities_of_the_north_desc:0 "History runs deeper in the north, or so the bards say. Dynasties still recount the cities they ruled on the mainland before the coming of the humans and tell the stories of the ancient kings who led their people from starving refugees to prosperous city-dwellers. While no family is eternal, the Amezatany bloodlines certainly don't seem to be ebbing away any time soon. As such, we must make them our allies. If we promise to involve them in our future conquests (and the spoils thereof), they will surely see that there is more benefit in working with us than against us."
 L37_growth_of_loranakodro_title:0 "Growth of Loranakodro"
 L37_growth_of_loranakodro_desc:0 "While often ignored in favor of the dynastic cities of the north and clove-ports of the south, Loranakodro has the capacity to be one of the great trade centers of Fahvanosy. Its great college trains Mihipha and learned men from across the isles, including at one time our very own King Haingo, and its sailors are at the forefront of exploration. If we invest in its infrastructure, we could gain unimaginable wealth down the line. After all, while its western position may make it ill-suited for trade with Sarhal, it is perfectly placed for any potential contact with our long-lost brethren."
 L37_mihipha_patronage_title:0 "Mihipha Patronage"
 L37_mihipha_patronage_desc:0 "“While King Haingo is primarily remembered for his conquests, he was also a great patron of the mihipha. Long lacking any sort of central accreditation or authority, the royally supported growth of the Mihipha College meant that the art form finally had some standardization and professionalization. Haingo benefited both as a ruler who could call upon more talented mages and as a wizard himself, who could now study under great masters right in his capital.” - A Short History of Our Southern Brothers, Published 1775 by Viswall University Press"
 L37_cross_the_toll_title:0 "Cross the Toll"
 L37_cross_the_toll_desc:0 "With the aid of our new fleet, we have crossed the Toll to the isle of Tsamonosy. Furthermore, we have conquered it! Now that we have secured the land, we have control over the most valuable resource in all of Fahvanosy: cloves. These spices draw traders from across the world, securing unimaginable wealth for us. To secure our monopoly, the remaining isolated tribes must be made to submit, and their lands turned to cultivation."
 L37_the_unity_of_the_isles_title:0 "The Unity of the Isles"
 L37_the_unity_of_the_isles_desc:0 "It has long been known that the Fahvanosy are impossible to unify. The halflings are too quarrelsome; the proud dynasts of the north and clove-tenders of the south could never learn to live together. The Mboala jungle is too dense for armies to easily pass through, and the multitude of surrounding islands makes it difficult for land-based states to assert direct control. The rowdy mihipha are a potent propaganda weapon that could never be controlled by one state. These are merely some of the challenges our success has defied. For the first time ever, the Vzemby bow to one king!"
 L37_launch_the_fleet_title:0 "Launch the Fleet"
 L37_launch_the_fleet_desc:0 "While often ignored in favor of the dynastic cities of the north and clove-ports of the south, Loranakodro has the capacity to be one of the great trade centers of Fahvanosy.

 flavor_mihitarab.1.t:0 "Death of the Queen"
 flavor_mihitarab.1.d:0 "It is a tragic day, for our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has died. She was found in bed, seeming to have simply fallen asleep. [Root.Heir.GetName], after an initial period of shock, quickly took charge and led an investigation into the death. While [Root.Monarch.GetName] was in good health, no evidence of foul play has been found, even after a magical examination by [Root.Heir.GetName]. The end of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] long and prosperous rule has led to great mourning among the commoners, who hope that [Root.Heir.GetName] will follow the legacy of his predecessor. This seems unlikely, as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] has a dream that will doubtlessly require bloodshed–the unification of Fahnavosy."
 flavor_mihitarab.1.a:0 "[Root.Heir.GetName] shall lead us to greatness!"
 flavor_mihitarab.2.t:0 "The King and the High Priestess"
 flavor_mihitarab.2.d:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] cleared his throat and then spoke with a magically amplified voice. “I wish to parlay with your leader!” [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] continued to stand outside of the great temple of Lel until the doors cracked open and a richly garbed female figure emerged, fuming with rage. “Who are you to negotiate, now that you have defied the Goddess by attacking her city!” Straightening his back, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] responded, “I am one who would ensure that her city is never attacked again. I am one who wishes for its towers to rise higher than ever before, and for its temples to truly reflect the greatness of Lel. I am one who would ensure that all halflings would feel the Goddess’s love, and that the rights of her priestesses are respected.” Once the speech was over, the priestess assumed a contemplative tone. “Perhaps, then… even one such as you can be forgiven.”"
 flavor_mihitarab.2.a:0 "The Goddess works in mysterious ways."
 flavor_mihitarab.3.t:0 "A New Age"
 flavor_mihitarab.3.d:0 "At the beginning of the age of unity, a wind rose over the sea. It first blew through the ancient cities of the Amezatany, where ancient dynasties awaited their return to distant shores. It blew through the Mboala Jungle, where herders bred their dogs in peace, and into Tsanamosy, bearing rain to the clove-tenders. At last it circled north, bringing ships home to Loranakodro from distant lands. Nowhere in Fahvanosy did it pass through battlefields, and everywhere it saw prosperity. Merchants peacefully traded with halflings whom their ancestors would have slaughtered for a far more meager prize. Farmers tilled the land, free from the fear that the passing army would despoil their crops. The Mihipha traveled throughout the isles, bringing the fruits of their hard-won knowledge to the masses. And above it all, a [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] stood on a balcony, reflecting on what [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] had accomplished. The wind then blew towards distant horizons and the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]’s gaze followed it."
 flavor_mihitarab.3.a:0 "Greatness awaits!"
 flavor_mihitarab.4.t:0 "Journey to the Genie Ruins"
 flavor_mihitarab.4.d:0 "Expedition’s Log, Day 30.\n\n We have finally found something. One of our fellows who was mauled by the desert monster last night has made a miraculous recovery, seemingly due to a useless artifact that we had been using to store water. It appears to be made of a hard, gold-like substance inset with gems, and slightly glows in the dark. It also has text in the ancient script of this land, though it is scratched enough that only the name Boqorada Duqaddha can be made out. While she appears in Fahvanosy legend, our local guide informs us that she was an associate of the great Aaradmiya. Further investigation into the stories of the Genies will be required."
 flavor_mihitarab.4.a:0 "The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] may find this of use."
 flavor_mihitarab.5.t:0 "Journey to the West"
 flavor_mihitarab.5.d:0 "While legend has long spoken of hardy halflings who traveled into the west and lived on small islands, there has never been any recorded contact with them beyond tall tales. This, however, changed when our valiant ships sighted suspiciously small shapes on an island beach a few days ago.\n\nUpon making landfall, our crews were approached by halflings wearing strange clothing and speaking a mutilated form of our language. These initial differences, however, were quickly overcome when our modern products were displayed for trade. Spices, fish, and exotic plants have been exchanged for metal tools and finely carved devotional objects, a testament to our shared faith in the Great Family. They have also directed us to neighboring islands that hold more of our cousins, and now eagerly await the return of our ships. With this enthusiasm, our wider Vzemby family will be united in no time!"
 flavor_mihitarab.5.a:0 "Great!"
 flavor_mihitarab.6.t:0 "Cultprit Found"
 flavor_mihitarab.6.d:0 "They crept through the silent jungle, coming upon a lonely, dilapidated shrine. The soldiers crawled through the underbrush, surrounding the structure.\n\n It had all led here. The knife marked by a local blacksmith, the inns on the road, and local reports of an odd magician. This was where the assassin’s master lived.\n\n The silence was broken by the sound of cracking wood as the door caved in. Soldiers rushed through the building, clearing every room, until one found a halfling in priestly garments. The soldier was blasted backwards with a shout of “Vengeance!”, but more swarmed into the room and wrestled the priest to the ground."
 flavor_mihitarab.6.a:0 "We will get this “priest” to talk."
 flavor_mihitarab.7.t:0 "Magnificent Feast"
 flavor_mihitarab.7.d:0 "Laughter echoed through the hall as the coronation banquet proceeded. Despite having been delayed out of respect for the previous queen, it still attracted nobles and other notables from throughout Mihitarab and the isles. As [Root.Monarch.GetName] surveyed the hall, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] saw a few friends of the old monarch, here both to mourn and to get a measure of the new most powerful ruler in Fahvanosy, as well as many new faces. Even the servants seemed different, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] duly noted, with many of those he had seen at previous feasts seemingly being absent. “My liege” started one of them. “I have something urgent for you.” The servant extended his hand, holding a piece of paper."
 flavor_mihitarab.7.a:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] moved to grasp it…"
 flavor_mihitarab.8.t:0 "Prisoner reveals their secrets"
 flavor_mihitarab.8.d:0 "The prisoner gurgled something. “Finally ready to talk?” The head rose, and then fell. A nod. “We’ll get you some water.” The guard left. \n\nWater crashed across the prisoners head. “There’s your water. Now talk.” Was the voice the same or new? It seemed deeper. “Had to… knife. Magic… not work. Work on… assassin. Worked on… queen.” A voice echoed from the dark. “What did you say?” “Have to… they tell us… the monarchs must die.” “WHO! ANSWER ME!” Burning pain shot through the prisoners side. A punch? “The… lords. In the jungles.” “ANSWER ME!” Pain unlike anything he had ever experienced ran through the prisoner's body, the magical arts turned towards torture."
 flavor_mihitarab.8.a:0 " It was too much, and he went to meet his treacherous gods."
 flavor_mihitarab.9.t:0 "Hidden Horrors"
 flavor_mihitarab.9.d:0 "In our most ancient myths, there were more members of The Family than there are today. They were cast out for betraying their relatives, placing themselves ahead of the whole, and are thus known as They Who Would Abandon the Family. They whisper in the ears of mortals, causing all their selfishness.\n\n It has long been thought that no halfling would willingly follow these monsters, but we were wrong. Our investigators have found whole villages of dedicated cultists, all of whom seem to be planning for something. Some were even caught and have not been seen since. If Mihitarab, no, Fahvanosy as a whole is to survive, these betrayers must be wiped out, whatever the cost may be."
 flavor_mihitarab.9.a:0 "Suffer Not the Heretics to Live!"
 flavor_mihitarab.10.t:0 "Assassination Attempt"
 flavor_mihitarab.10.d:0 "…and was met with a knife. It flashed towards his chest, thrusting into his chest and plunging the hall into chaos. The surrounding nobles pounced on the assassin, but as they did so the killer went limp. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] struggled for life, blood rushing across the floor, as bodyguards rushed him to his bed. The city's best doctors were summoned, but were unable to either revive the assassin or restore the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]’s health as day passed into night. While [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] had lost a significant quantity of blood, recovery would ordinarily have been quick if not for a mysterious weakness that overcame [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]. As day approached, the situation was grim."
 flavor_mihitarab.10.a:0 "We can do no more than pray."
 flavor_mihitarab.11.t:0 "Miraculous Recovery"
 flavor_mihitarab.11.d:0 "The Family has blessed us! [Root.Monarch.GetName] has recovered from his wounds! [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] is still bedridden, but the bleeding has stopped and the weakness has seemingly dissipated. As soon as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] awoke, speculation began as to those behind the attack. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] thinks that magic may have been responsible for both his weakness and the end of the assassin, or even the death of his mother. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] has vowed that the assassins, all who supported them, and all who harbored them will pay the ultimate price. Otherwise, they may strike again."
 flavor_mihitarab.11.a:0 "We must find those responsible!"
 flavor_mihitarab.12.t:0 "An Era of Peace and Prosperity"
 flavor_mihitarab.12.d:0 "“My child, what troubles you?” [Root.Monarch.GetName] and [Root.Heir.GetName] stood on a balcony, viewing both the fishing boats visible only as shadows in the setting sun and the bug farmers returning from the jungle. “I merely wonder how long all of this will last. One day, the Dog Lords may come out of the jungle and put an end to all of this.” Turning to him, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] asked “What, then, would you do?” “Conquer them.” After noticing the shocked expression on [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s usually placid face, [Root.Heir.GetName] continued. “The only reason Mihitarab prospers as it does is because of your skill in preventing wars. The only way to prevent them in the long term is for both sides to be united under one rule, and we have the opportunity to do just that. Why not take it?”"
 flavor_mihitarab.12.a:0 "Tell me more about your idea."
 flavor_mihitarab.12.b:0 "We cannot risk war destroying all we have built."
 flavor_mihitarab.13.t:0 "Dog Lords Swear Loyality"
 flavor_mihitarab.13.d:0 "“...and of course, you will be required to provide a regular tribute.” At this the eyes of the assembled Dog Lords snapped upwards. They were assembled, kneeling before [Root.Monarch.GetName]‘s throne, listening to what would be required of them as subjects of Mihitarab. While many had begun to drift off during the endless regulations around insect farming rights, all of them knew that these tributes were the main imposition upon their tribes. “For the first year, however, you must each provide the greatest hound of your packs. For my conquest is not finished, and I require protection. I also require great warriors, who will no doubt be generously rewarded for their troubles. Do you have any objections?"
 flavor_mihitarab.13.a:0 "The cheers of approval resounded across the Isles."
 flavor_mihitarab.14.t:0 "Back to School"
 flavor_mihitarab.14.d:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] looked across the ground of the Mihipha College and remembered. While it was certainly still impressive when [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] had attended, it was much smaller, a single complex  progressively expanded over the centuries into a haphazard mess. Now, however, it was scarcely recognizable. Specialized buildings for different subjects, a library containing the pooled knowledge of all Fahvanosy, and a tower full of arcane secrets all coexisted with the grand pools and gardens. The greatest bards now taught in the lecture halls, lured with occasionally outrageous sums of money. More students sat in those halls than ever before, brought to the College through the bustling port of Loranakodro. A smile came over [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s face as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] contemplated all the good this would do for the students, the local economy, and the prosperity of all the Isles."
 flavor_mihitarab.14.a:0 "Let's hope they put my name on one of the buildings…"
 flavor_mihitarab.15.t:0 "A view on the Bakya Bay"
 flavor_mihitarab.15.d:0 "Long ago, our brethren sailed into the west, where, it was said, lived an undying race.\n\n Long ago, great genies ruled in the east, creating works of incredible power, only rumors of which reached our ancestors.\n\n With Mihitarab’s expanding naval power, bold adventurers have suggested expeditions to both of these lands, but none could agree which should take priority. This impasse was solved when [Root.Monarch.GetName] proposed an even more ambitious plan–undertaking both expeditions at the same time.\n\nNow, in Bakya Bay, lie the results of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] efforts; two fleets equipped for these great enterprises. Their missions: to explore strange new lands; to seek out new life and new civilizations; to boldly go where (few) halflings have gone before! "
 flavor_mihitarab.15.a:0 "And, of course, to secure wealth and power for Mihitarab."
