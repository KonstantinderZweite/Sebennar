 great_dookan_events.1.d:0 "The spirits shift around the shaman as he raises his arms and continues his chant. The air is static with magic. Then it begins; first, the warriors closest to him shout out, then those within earshot. The wave ripples out as a deafening roar erupts from the army, overtaken by the rage of centuries."

 great_dookan_events.2.d:0 "Our lands are inhabited by those that are not of Dookan. Some of our warriors and shamans have taken to righting this wrong. They return telling of the pathetic screams of the men, women and children that deigned to remain under orcish rule. They are now quiet."

 great_dookan_events.6.d:0 "Shaman steps out of his tent, where he spent several hours mutilating his own body to see an omen from Dookan through unbearable pain. He looks tired, but satisfied.

 great_dookan_events.8.d:0 "Shaman steps out of his tent, where he spent several hours mutilating his own body to see an omen from Dookan through unbearable pain.

Allow me to share this wisdom with you!""

 great_dookan_events.11.d:0 "Shamans wield power of Dookan himself and they can summon his wrath against enemies, who cowardly hide in their holds. Let's gather our shamans and let them destroy enemy's walls!"

 great_dookan_events.12.d:0 "Rarely, shamans of different tribes overcome their conflicts and rivalry to gather together and try to speak with Dookan directly. It allows them to directly ask Dookan about advise, without uncertainty of omens.\n\nToday is the day when our shamans managed to gather meeting to ask Dookan about future of our tribe. They are secluded in spirit's tent for many hours, performing sacred rituals. And when seclusion is over, the eldest shaman speaks:\n\n"It is time for...""

 great_dookan_events.14.d:0 "We tried to keep the Shamans' findings a secret, but like a splash of blood into a then-calm pool, the rumour quickly spread throughout the land. And despite all our recent successes, it seems some are taking the omen seriously. Already there are those decrying our competence, pointing to mere coincidence and unlucky chance as proof of Dookan's disfavour. And it seems they are choosing to make their anger clear in the way Orcs do: with force of arms!"
