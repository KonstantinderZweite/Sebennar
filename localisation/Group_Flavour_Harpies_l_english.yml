 build_our_roost_title:0 "Build Our Roost"
 build_our_roost_desc:0 "Most races of Halcann build their capitals in farmlands, where they have plenty of food nearby. However we have been blessed with wings that will carry our daughters far and wide. And so we have often made our homes in the mountains and hills, where we can build our nests safe from harm. It is time to do so again, let us build our cities out of reach from hostility up high in the rocks where only feathers can reach them!"

 harpy_events.100.t:0 "The Daughters of [Root.Monarch.GetName]"
 harpy_events.100.desc:0 "The most esteemed [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], mother of the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] flock, victorious in battle, and terror of her enemies, has a reputation as one of the greatest Harpies of her age and is unchallenged as a ruler.\nAs befits a ruler of her calibre and stature the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has given birth many capable children, several of whom show great promise as future rulers. As both the children themselves and our government officials are aware, however, only one can inherit and there is little in the way of consolation prizes. Our officials are adamant that it is now high time for [Root.Monarch.GetName] to name a favourite among the possible successors. This is unlikely to end the competition for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] favor but it will hopefully stop the worst succession struggles that might follow if our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] should suffer death without having picked a clear successor."

 harpy_events.101.d:0 "An Ottoman coronation ceremony is the most grand thing many will see in their lifetime and the coronation of [Root.Monarch.GetName] is no exception. As the Sword of Osman is girded upon [Root.Monarch.GetName] by the Sharif of Konya, however, our Viziers look upon [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] with some amount of dread. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] was never the most likely of candidates and would likely never have taken the throne if a clear favorite had existed.\nSome would go as far as to say that it was [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] mediocrity that allowed [Root.Monarch.GetName] to triumph. Greater men never considered [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] a threat and others hoped to control the Empire through [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]. One thing our new [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has clearly demonstrated: When the need arises [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] will not shy away from sinking a dagger in the back of those that trust [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]."
