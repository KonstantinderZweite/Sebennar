 flavour_haraagtseda.01.title:0 "To Tame a Land"
 flavour_haraagtseda.01.desc:0 "The clanging rhythm of hammers on metal rang from the settlement, a growing sprawl of steel, stone and wood surrounded by a sea of tents through which weaved thousands of dark, shaggy furred Fieldstalker Gnolls and their Echenka serfs. Tall human tribesmen ran to and fro, ferrying raw materials and finished goods between groups of chattering gnoll artisans.\n\nRozherg observed these countless small interactions as he patrolled the perimeter of the camp with a band of faithful warriors. It had been nearly two years since he and his pack had discovered Esuvrem, the great palace of shimmering steel within the cave hidden beneath the hill, he could still remember the feeling as he warped open the titanic metal doors using the Hammer of Kvanga. Trepidation, a threshold crossed.\n\nWho had built the vast complex he had no idea, but his pack had wasted no time in beginning to break down and repurpose the hoard of enchanted steel within. Even now they had yet to fully explore the depths of the place, but in the time since the small camp they had built atop the hill had become the first true permanent city in the Haraagtseda federation, Kvangraak.\n\nHis pack had become major players within the tribal league of Kvangahgan packs, warriors clad in enchanted steel from his forges repelled raids from the west and neighbouring packs had sworn fealty to him and begun to build settlements of their own. Rozherg could smell change on the hot savannah wind. He could see that this homeland of the ancient gnollish faith was on the cusp of finally uniting. He could hear the call of Kvanga to be the gnoll to lead them, and he would answer!"

 flavour_haraagtseda.02.title:0 "Trials of the Mazla Haraag"
 flavour_haraagtseda.02.desc:0 "Beginning with the death of Rozherg I, the Haraagtsedi would select their Mazla Haraag or "Master Maker" through a series of trials to test the skills, diligence and leadership of prospective candidates. Open to any Rram Zelag willing to apply, the trials honoured the Fieldstalker traditions of gladiatorial combat by having each candidate gather a band of warriors, forge their armaments and then command them in ritualised combat against the bands of other candidates. The tournaments could go on for some time, but eventually a winner would be crowned the new leader of the Haraagtseda and granted ownership of The Hammer of Kvanga.\n\nThere are two particularly promising candidates in this most recent trial, we could tip the scales in favour of a particular aspirant but this may anger some groups within the League that feel the trials should be a fair competition."

 desc_haraagtseda_rozherg_the_hammer_of_kvanga:0 "As one of the traditional leaders of a Haraagtsedi pack, a Holy-Smith or "Rram Zelag", Rozherg had inherited the mantle of leadership at a young age from his master, as well as the clans holy relic, a massive enchanted warhammer known as the Hammer of Kvanga that allowed the wielder to shape and enchant metal at will. This powerful relic allowed Rozherg to access the Dao palace that the gnolls referred to as Esuvrem and set his pack on the path to greatness. Regarded as the father of the nation, Rozherg was also a talented warrior and commander in his own right, the powers of the Hammer made Rozherg into a force to be reckoned with on the battlefield and were said to have given him an unnaturally long life for a gnoll"
