 J84_1_2_setting_the_sun_title: "Setting the Sun"
 J84_1_2_setting_the_sun_desc: "The “Jaherian Exemplars” – the prodigal sons and daughters of Tacenie’s empire. They came to Taychend to disperse the darkness, but in their arrogance they made two mistakes. First, they awoke a force even they could not control, their words the spark to the greatest peasant and slave movement since Vehasha’s own. Secondly, they underestimated us. Underestimated our people, underestimated our power, underestimated our history. They seek to destroy everything that made us great – but we will not let them."

 J84_1_4_hero_cults_of_the_exemplary_title: "Hero-Cults of the Exemplary"
 J84_1_4_hero_cults_of_the_exemplary_desc: "The Exemplars are powerful beyond measure, a military and religious organisation without equal – but they turned their power to foolish pursuits, chasing shadows across Aelantir and beyond. Their organisation is so similar to the organisation of our own Hero-Cults and religious brotherhoods – if we turned their cult of exemplary into a cult of glory, we could use their power in the expansion of our Empire, while the Warlord-Heralds do what they wish with the Dry Coast. \n\nThere are, of course, those who view this as a fool’s errand too – should this effort prove too difficult, we can simply expel these prodigal elves, and fold the Taychendi immigrants who had moved to their lands into our empire."

 J84_1_5_ending_an_exile_title: "Ending an Exile"
 J84_1_5_ending_an_exile_desc: "The Dugui’hi, the original denizens of the Mushroom Forest to the north. Their mercenaries and travelling alchemists have been a notable if uncommon sight through Taychend since their exile in the 1200s – but all know their eyes have always been on their original home. The Advakhalla of Sedregenghi were close to supporting an effort to end their exile in the mid 1400s, but the venture failed – by finishing the job, we may be able to add to our empire a valuable new province indeed, as the riches of the Mushroom Forest will flow to us from a grateful people."

 J84_1_7_strategic_herbicide_title: "Strategic Herbicide"
 J84_1_7_strategic_herbicide_desc: "The jungle to the north has always been an impenetrable wall, but the world has changed – war has changed! We are no longer the frightened children skirting the edge of the jungle, stealing wood and hunting the dregs that crawl out of the treeline – with the secrets of artificery opening themselves to us, the possibility of launching an organised campaign of colonisation against the Effelai has become tantalisingly real! First, however, we must decide exactly how many of these new weapons we wish to deploy against the jungle…"

 J84_1_8_bloom_and_bust_title: "Bloom and Bust"
 J84_1_8_bloom_and_bust_desc: "So the jungle finally wakes, and seeks to destroy us? So be it – our battle shall be legendary! As the Effelai blooms, our mages and artificers believe that we now have a golden opportunity to destroy it for good.\n\nAt a command, the orders can be sent out, the warlords called to the Imperial banner – soon, two-hundred thousand will march on the jungle, flame-throwing staves and sparkdrive cannon in their hands. The Effelai blooms – let’s make it go bust!"

 J84_1_9_there_stood_the_grass_title: "There Stood the Grass"
 J84_1_9_there_stood_the_grass_desc: "As our artificers and mages scavenge the effelai’s “corpse”, we have discovered that our victory may not be as total as we thought – and we have realised that may not be such a bad thing. The Effelai is not truly dead, but fractured – and those fractured remnants might be controllable.\n\nIf we are to advance, you must seize those remnants, turn them to use. Ignore opposition, ignore your hesitation – where once stood living grass, now lies reanimated power."

 J84_1_10_a_fleet_born_of_fire_title: "A Fleet Born of Fire"
 J84_1_10_a_fleet_born_of_fire_desc: "The scourged forest held many secrets, but above all those it also had a wealth of high-quality lumber. Already some of our warlords have moved north, setting up camps through the scorched remains of the Effelai. Go and sponsor these Woodcutter-Warlords, and connect their camps to newly built shipyards along the Effelai coast.\n\nSoon, we shall begin converting the jungle’s riches into the greatest fleet the world has ever seen – born of fire, and more glorious than flame!"

 J84_1_11_fear_on_every_shore_title: "Fear on Every Shore"
 J84_1_11_fear_on_every_shore_desc: "More ships leave our Effelai shipyards by the day – so build more.\n\nOur fleets grow, and the oceans of Halann reveal themselves to vainglorious eyes, battle-hungry and blood-thirsty – so let them off the leash.\n\nWhen you’re finished, and we rule the ocean? Nobody will ever look at the sea again and feel safe."

 J84_1_14_shadow_and_blood_title: "Shadow and Blood"
 J84_1_14_shadow_and_blood_desc: "Sarhal brims with magic – and that means it brims with new secrets to uncover as well. With the Shadowswamp, a land of twisting darkness, and the Ashama, a people cursed by forces unknown, so close to our new provinces, we simply cannot let this opportunity pass.\n\nYou must raise a new magical institution around the dark tower of Metat Tagokag – cursed, but brimming with energy. Support our efforts, and we shall unweave the winding spells of shadow and blood – and turn them to the Empire’s advantage."

 #Column 2
 J84_2_2_institutional_apotheosis_title: "Institutional Apotheosis"
 J84_2_2_institutional_apotheosis_desc: "The veneration of a ruler’s ancestors is a powerful tool in any warlord’s playbook. It allows one to cast themselves as having the personal favour of those gods, by virtue of blood, and provides a direct channel with which any subject can direct sacrifices and offerings to the ruling dynasty. The Imperial Cult, therefore, is a vital part of any Taychendi empire – and it will be for our own as well. By building temples to the imperial family’s deceased members and previous rulers, and investing into a powerful organisation that will oversee the various hero-cults to those ascended gods, we can entrench the image of the imperial family, and remind all of the glory of our empire."

 J84_2_3_the_weaver_of_fates_title: "The Weaver of Fates"
 J84_2_3_the_weaver_of_fates_desc: "The Fateweaver of Korrimutren is one of the most powerful oracles anywhere in the world, a great divination relic hooked directly into the skeletal corpse of a Precursor mage, that can allow a powerful enough divination mage to see directly – and almost always truly – into the future. The Fateweaver’s predictions have driven Taychendi history – they sparked the Chendhyan invasions, brought low the First Gophiran empire and in the process ensured the Second Empire’s rise, and, of course, it granted Laskaris the Conqueror a fate-woven shield of quasi-immortality that would spur his conquests in Taychend. We cannot leave fate to chance – it is time [Root.Monarch.GetName] paid the Weaver of Fates a visit."

 J84_2_4_agricultural_evolution_title: "Agricultural Evolution"
 J84_2_4_agricultural_evolution_desc: "The land of Taychend, and the three great rivers that dominate it – the Vyech, the Endioka, the Kalavend – is one of the most bountiful in Taychend. When the glaciers melt, and the storm clouds gather, the farms of Taychend produce enough grain to feed tens of millions. At the height of the Second Gophiran Empire, it is said that Taychend’s goliath agricultural base supported a population of 40 million – but the death throes of Gophira ravaged that base. By 1400, the Taychendi population had dropped by half. If we are to become the greatest empire Taychend has ever seen, we will need to invest in plant growth magic, grain silos, irrigation – and not just expand, but evolve that which feeds our cities and our armies."

 J84_2_5_paths_of_ascention_title: "Paths of Ascention"
 J84_2_5_paths_of_ascention_desc: "The Violet Library, the venerable institution that formed the heart of the enlightened and prosperous Dannuka Dumrusvarn of Taychendi late antiquity, is known for expending tremendous effort into documenting the deeds of any god heroes they can find, storing tens of thousands of records within their labyrinthine archives.\n\nIn their efforts, they have developed a concept called “the Thousand Paths of Ascension”, which seeks to highlight paths aside from warfare that can lead to apotheosis. If we are to build a glorious empire, we need our smiths, our architects, our dockhands, our shopkeeps and bakers – we cannot have everyone throwing themselves into the fray of battle. Perhaps, then, it may be worth officially supporting this idea?"

 J84_2_7_unravelling_divinity_title: "Unravelling Divinity"
 J84_2_7_unravelling_divinity_desc: "The Ravelians are a group dedicated to uncovering the secrets of Halann and beyond – and, as their organisation spreads through the tendrils of Cannor’s colonial networks, we are beginning to understand just how many secrets they have uncovered.\n\nAdvanced knowledge of shadowy organisations, extraplanar exploration, artificer knowledge that would put even the Vustarin to shame… already, some of our warlords have been trying to gain the Ravelian’s trust, and thus access to their secrets – but before we can officially sanction this, we must learn more about this new group."

 J84_2_8_the_gifts_of_cerachmanu_title: "The Gifts of Cerachmanu"
 J84_2_8_the_gifts_of_cerachmanu_desc: "Cerachmanu, what we call the prisons beneath the world, and the Cannorians call the Infernal Planes. It is a dark place, full of beings as evil as they are powerful – and that power has proven itself attractive to many in Taychend through the years.\n\nVarious Taychendi groups, like the Cennayakuta of Imarchend, have a long history of consorting with devils and demons. With new knowledge from the Ravelian archives now available to us, it is high time you exploited that which lies away from the eyes of the gods."

 J84_2_9_its_in_the_blood_title: "It's in the Blood"
 J84_2_9_its_in_the_blood_desc: "Now that we have accepted the Errant Princess’ offer, it is time to make good on our end of the deal. By increasing the influence of Mihaela’s new vampiric clan within our realm and military, and rooting out any potential threats to our new bloody regime, we can ascend to a power we had never believed possible."

 J84_2_10_sanguosynthesis_title: "Sanguosynthesis"
 J84_2_10_sanguosynthesis_desc: "At their core, elves are animals. We are born, we eat, we reproduce, we die. But we reproduce to our limit. Taychendi families are – the Imperial Population is – only so large as our resources allow. And our army is only so large as our population is.\n\nBut we reproduce to our limit. So build more farms, increase production, render our fields fertile. And with the fruit of the ground, the blood of the earth? Fuel the blood of conquest… people. Bodies for the war machine, for the banners, uncountable and infinite.\n\nTaychend rises to its limit. Raise it."

 J84_2_11_orphans_of_aesadas_title: "Orphans of Aesadas"
 J84_2_11_orphans_of_aesadas_desc: "The Ozgar orcs have grown restless under the control of a slaving empire such as our own – so we’ll have to force them to kneel. There is one thing both them and us know for real – might makes right. And so an Ozarm’Chadash will decide this issue. You must fight in it.\n\nAfter that, their fate is in your hands. Some of our scholars believe that the scions of Aesadas had a hand in their creation - but if so, they clearly did not have the power to control them. They slipped through their grasp - they will not slip through ours. Isn't that glorious?"

 J84_2_12_the_lizardfolk_expedition_title: "The Lizardfolk Expedition"
 J84_2_12_the_lizardfolk_expedition_desc: "For centuries, we did not know what the statues and tapestries represented – vague representations of our ancestors striking down scaled foes from across the sea, huge spires cracked and splintered under our might. We know now, though. 7000 years ago, our ancestors embarked on a great expedition, to utterly destroy the Lizardfolk’s ancient civilization.\n\nThe Lizardfolk have rebuilt themselves over the years – and so the opportunity presents itself to not just redo what the Precursors did, but surpass them. Take the fleets, prepare our forces at Teramzerai, and the War of the Second Usurpation will begin!"

 J84_2_13_the_burning_harbours_title: "The Burning Harbours"
 J84_2_13_the_burning_harbours_desc: "The Lizardfolk are a truly great people, their mastery in arts, sciences and magic clear to see. When the war is over, when we have integrated these people into our empire, we may make use of their strength in our banners – but for now, we will make use of their strength in another way.\n\nKarassk, Nazhni, Khugra, the great port cities of the coastal Lizardfolk? Let us loose on them. We will reap the riches of our conquest, and send them back to your realm, and the burning harbours, set alight by our mage-flame, will be the beacon of the Empire’s arrival. All you need do is stand by and watch…"

 J84_2_14_the_second_usurpation_title: "The Second Usurpation"
 J84_2_14_the_second_usurpation_desc: "The enemy gave all they had, but they still fell before us like reeds against the hurricane. How could they not? Now, as we stand in the scoured ruins of Zerat, trains of loot, slaves and ancient technology passing through, we may complete that which we started, and finally surpass our ancestors.\n\nGive us the order, and we will usurp the Golden Scales once again… and this time, we shall hold them for good!"

 #Column 3
 J84_3_1_a_warlord_empire_title: "A Warlord Empire"
 J84_3_1_a_warlord_empire_desc: "Ebenanth, Yodhan, Varanash, Ultarlan, Olhokar – we stand in the same place those great conquerors once stood: unifiers of Taychend. But we are only here because the empires of those elves crumbled after their deaths, as they either exploded into rebellion or stagnated and weakened over decades – we must not repeat the same mistake.\n\nWe are an empire of warlords – our power is built on them, and our future greatness will be won by them. But unlike our predecessors, as our conquests bring those warlords loot and plunder, we will not waste those riches – our ambition and our glory will be the crucible that will raise cities, monuments, bend the way of the world itself! Taychend will rise once more, as the empire to end all empires, and Taychend will rise alone, by its own strength – as the Empire Vainglorious!"

 J84_3_3_vaona_gophira_title: "Vaona Gophira"
 J84_3_3_vaona_gophira_desc: "The Gophirans moved millions of elven slaves across their empire at their height, using them to construct great monuments and extract the resources of their empire. Though we must do the same, there is a great problem – we can no longer rely on the wars of glory, the unrestricted wars between warlords, that truly supported Taychend’s slave population. To kickstart our slave economy, we must look abroad for new targets, and stimulate the various slave markets through our empire. Only then can the Periyodhai, the constant semi-ritualised battles between warlords and city-states, sustain the cycle of terror and brutality that underpins the engines of vainglory."

 J84_3_4_a_land_of_cities_title: "A Land of Cities"
 J84_3_4_a_land_of_cities_desc: "In Taychend, the city-state is the base unit of politics and society. They range in size from walled farming-villages to great metropolises, their warlords ranging from respected community members appointed by their community to absolutist warlord-kings, who can command tens of thousands of warriors. Care must be paid to those small city-states, of course – but that is the job of the greater ones. By investing in those greater city states, we can create scores of star-like cities, that radiate their prosperity out to the territories under their control."

 J84_3_6_beyond_taychend_title: "Beyond Taychend"
 J84_3_6_beyond_taychend_desc: "Andeios is ours. The heart of southern Aelantir, a land of magnificent cities, great peoples, legendary stories and myths, is now under our total control. But as we have so dearly learned, there is a world beyond Taychend – the Empire Vainglorious may rise alone, but it will not rise in isolation.\n\nNew ways of dealing with magic are being pioneered, new religions, professing ancient truths and possessing cutting-edge innovations, are sprouting up across the world. And the warlords, gorged on the vainglory of their conquests, are clamouring for new foes to invade, new riches to plunder – and as news of new discoveries arrive in our ports, they clamour for new secrets to unlock and powers to gain. We won’t deny their demands.\n\nOne wonders if you could…"

 J84_3_7_no_stone_unturned_title: "No Stone Unturned"
 J84_3_7_no_stone_unturned_desc: "The Slaver-Nobles, the Precursor elves who used to rule Taychend before the ruin, left countless ruins dotting the landscape of Taychend. While many of them have already been ransacked for artefacts and relics, or even dismantled for their Precursor steel and scrap, there remains a great many of them hidden below ground, out of sight – but not necessarily out of reach. We need more relics for our burgeoning experiments with Artificery – and if we have to dig up half of Taychend to find them, so be it!"

 J84_3_8_the_way_of_warlords_title: "The Way of Warlords"
 J84_3_8_the_way_of_warlords_desc: "To the warlords, might makes right, victory makes glory – and autonomy allows more victory. It is those beliefs, however, that caused so much trouble for empires past.\n\nThere are two approaches to this problem – one follows the path of the Mudaliars: to sit up on the high chair and make oneself an aid, not a hindrance, to the ambitions of your subordinates. The other is the path of the Gophirans – assert your power, remind your vassals that a restrained warlord can win more glory than a dead one. If we are to further Imperial power, you will need to pick that."

 J84_3_9_the_new_relic_lords_title: "The New Relic-Lords"
 J84_3_9_the_new_relic_lords_desc: "Since the Ruin, the Taychendi have been using the relics of the past to win glory in the present, powerful magical artefacts destroying armies and sundering cities. But the world is changing, and as kingdoms of glory turn into an Empire of Vainglory, warlords must change with them. \n\nThe new practice of Artificery will revolutionise our armies – and in doing so, the Relic-Lords of a new age shall rise, the Techno-Warlords unleashed. Integrate artificery into your military, hone your strengths, discard your weaknesses. Do that, and the world shall tremble."

 J84_3_10_in_heaven_and_halann_title: "In Heaven and Halann"
 J84_3_10_in_heaven_and_halann_desc: "In the material world, our armies sweep all before them. With sabre and staff, sparkdrive and cannon, Taychend’s supremacy is won through blood and fire.\n\nIt is not enough. Make the Imperial Cult supreme, be that by canonisation or apotheosis. Then, we shall raise your ancestors, as gods or saints, to divine rulership. Soon, our glory will stretch across planes – and your blood shall rule in both Heaven and Halann."

 J84_3_11_an_empire_vainglorious_title: "An Empire Vainglorious"
 J84_3_11_an_empire_vainglorious_desc: "Our banners have conquered lands never seen before, our adventurers delved into ruins not uncovered in centuries, our artificers created weapons never tested. Our ambition knows no bounds. Our vainglory disregards the concept entirely.\n\nTaychend has risen, and it will rise further. We’ve unified one half of the continent – there’s only one path ahead of us now, and no going back. But you know that already, don’t you?\n\nGo forth, and make the world bleed."

 J84_3_12_echoes_of_ebenanth_title: "Echoes of Ebenanth"
 J84_3_12_echoes_of_ebenanth_desc: "Ebenanth, the First Emperor. Mere decades after the Ruin, with the glory of the Precursor Elves still in living memory, his singular will – and his possession of the Great Relic, Starshear – allowed him to piece Taychend back together. Then he was murdered by his officers, and by the end of the decade his achievements had turned to ashes.\n\nStarshear was torn apart, its shards distributed among Ebenanth’s assassins – and then lost over the years. But who knows? The echoes of Ebenanth remain amongst us still, and fragments of the past have returned before…"

 J84_3_13_the_last_city_title: "The Last City"
 J84_3_13_the_last_city_desc: "In Ebenanth’s shattered memories, you found a treasure that so many have aspired to, but that none have ever grasped – the tiniest hint, the barest scrap, of the location of Tacenie. And confirmation of its survival.\n\nThe last of the flying cities is real, it is intact, and it is in the Chendhya. We must find it, no matter the cost, no matter the time.\n\nAnd then? The discovery of Tacenie gives us an opportunity that has never before been within our reach… a chance to truly begin a new cycle, and cement our rule forevermore."

 J84_3_15_year_one_title: "Year One"
 J84_3_15_year_one_desc: "A millennium and a half ago, the flying capital of the Precursor Empire, Aesadas, fell. Death and ruin and terror, and the cycle of the Slaver Nobles ended. Taychend descended into the Cycle of Glory, as empire after empire attempted usher in the next age, dominated by their rule.\n\nYour line succeeded – and now, all that remains is for us to proclaim our rule, for all the world to see.\n\nWe WILL raise Tacenie – and with its fall, we shall rise above, the masters of a new Cycle! We shall claim our destiny once and for all, long awaited, by scholars and soldiers, emperors and warlords alike – and you shall be our instrument!"

 #Column 4
 J84_4_2_suffer_no_interloper_title: "Suffer No Interloper"
 J84_4_2_suffer_no_interloper_desc: "“Taychend suffers no interloper.” The origin of the saying is unknown, with three dozen cities claiming their local god-hero was the first to say it. That only points to the prevalence of the sentiment – the destiny of Taychend is for the Taychendi alone to control. Laskaris the Conqueror intervened in our affairs when he launched his invasion – and then the city-state he ruled attempted to destroy our way of life. That cannot be allowed to stand – Ameion, as well as the two smaller cities that provided aid to their cause, must be seized, and the Kheionai must be taught a lesson they will not forget."

 J84_4_4_the_rhythm_of_war_title: "The Rhythm of War"
 J84_4_4_the_rhythm_of_war_desc: "There is little more glorious than war. The rush of battle, the elation of seeing the enemy rout before you, as the red-rays of the blooded sun of victory settle, and the vultures circle over a field of the dead. The dance of battle, and the rhythm of war. The Taychendi know it like no other – and they know that few others excel at it like they do.\n\nThey are so good at it, in fact, that enough competing military doctrines and ways of war have sprouted up over the years that one Taychendi army is often very different to another – if we are to claim our glory, however, we must march to the drum-beat we know best…"

 J84_4_5_titans_of_the_sea_title: "Titans of the Sea"
 J84_4_5_titans_of_the_sea_desc: "The seas may be terrifying to most Taychendi, but with experienced Kheionai sailors now being drawn from our Cleaved Sea territories, and the powerful Degárikes, as well as new designs of sail and mast, designed for the open ocean, Taychend has the opportunity to become a maritime power as well as a great land power – if the empire is to truly become the master of Andeios, it must learn to become the master of the waves."

 J84_4_7_the_depths_of_aercel_title: "The Depths of Aercel"
 J84_4_7_the_depths_of_aercel_desc: "Nanru Nakar, the city of cities! By all accounts, it is the greatest and largest Precursor city still standing – built over, as it has been, by over a millennium and a half of slums and temples and Taychendi-made monuments.\n\nBeneath its surface lies the Underground, a colossal labyrinth of slave warrens, storerooms, ancient laboratories and who knows what else. Its upper levels, the Undercity, is inhabited by the scum of Nanru Nakar – but the lower levels, the Underwarren, is filled with all manner of danger. Nobody knows how far the Underwarren goes – how deep the Slaver-Nobles delved. Why don’t we find out?"

 J84_4_8_the_riches_of_the_past_title: "The Riches of the Past"
 J84_4_8_the_riches_of_the_past_desc: "We have uncovered relic sites across Taychend, and uncover more by the day. Now that we have unearthed the secrets of the past, it is time to turn them into riches, and develop the infrastructure that will begin to shape our future!\n\nWhile we use those relics to fuel our burgeoning native artificery, there is another use for the surplus artefacts we dig up. The Cannorians will pay exorbitant sums for our goods – should you secure the trade networks around us, we will surely grow ever richer from their desires."

 J84_4_9_smoke_and_steel_title: "Smoke and Steel"
 J84_4_9_smoke_and_steel_desc: "The Vanbury Guild were a valued trading partner, despite the morally questionable character of their directors. When they sought to stand against us, however, we had no choice but to destroy them – now, we possess the heart of their former direct holdings.\n\nThe VG were halfway into turning Tor Nayyi into an industrial hellscape, an entire island of smoke and steel, processing the resource-profits of western Aelantir. You need to finish the Guild’s job."

 J84_4_10_the_heart_hungers_title: "The Heart Hungers"
 J84_4_10_the_heart_hungers_desc: "Its chambers reliquary, its valves mechanical – with arteries of the slain, and veins of the fallen. The ruin-steel heart of Taychend beats ever faster, and the rhythm of war is its pacemaker.\n\nBlood is conquest. The world is full. The heart hungers.\n\nFill. It. Up."

 J84_4_12_beyond_the_storm_title: "Beyond the Storm"
 J84_4_12_beyond_the_storm_desc: "PLACEHOLDER UNTIL INSYAA\n\nThe Precursors, some of our own ancestors among them, hid the greatest of their creations – the mighty, the terrible, the dangerous – behind the Kiamoa, an impassable wall of crashing lightning and powerful waves.\n\nBut the world is changing, and as our own power grows, the Kiamoa weakens. Send the order, and we will sail beyond the storm – Insyaa beckons, and its power awaits."

 J84_4_13_in_folly_opportunity_title: "In Folly, Opportunity"
 J84_4_13_in_folly_opportunity_desc: "PLACEHOLDER UNTIL INSYAA\n\nCould there be any bigger failure than the Mechanim? Not their creation, no, but their dismissal. When the Precursors of Insyaa discovered that their creations were sentient – and we are under no illusion that they are not – they cowered from their creation, shut them down.\n\nBut we are not the Precursors. We are the Empire Vainglorious, and we know that before might, morality falters.\n\nFind them. Bring them back. Those who came before failed – but we will fulfil the Mechanim’s original design, no matter what it takes."

 J84_4_14_harder_better_faster_stronger_title: "Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger"
 J84_4_14_harder_better_faster_stronger_desc: "PLACEHOLDER UNTIL INSYAA\n\nWhere the Precursors once cowered, we have thrown ourselves into the fray with every resource at our disposal. The true power of the Mechanim, greater than so many peoples in so many different ways, now lies in our hands.\n\nMost will be slaves, now and forever – but just as with the rest of our subjugated peoples, some will surely rise above, become warriors, generals, artists… and in time, warlords. So be it. Hook them into the Empire’s Ruin-Steel heart, and they will not only fulfil their original purpose, but surpass it – just as we have surpassed their ancient creators."

 #Column 5
 J84_5_2_we_will_make_you_care_title: "We Will Make You Care"
 J84_5_2_we_will_make_you_care_desc: "In good times, the Chendhyan steppe is far from the minds of most Taychendi rulers – those that have the luxury of ever being able to put the riders of the steppe out of their mind, that is. But as we grow in power, whispers stir of a gathering storm on the steppe, as the minor tribes of the Chendhya seek to challenge our power, and preserve their freedom. There are various groups who would like to see that challenge be furiously answered – perhaps it is time their calls were answered?"

 J84_5_3_raiders_of_the_moon_title: "Raiders of the Moon"
 J84_5_3_raiders_of_the_moon_desc: "There are few who are as good at raiding as the descendants of Munakles, or Munazhlan as they call him. Mounted on their feline cavalry, or else armed with the powers to move rock and soil itself, they have fiercely defended their freedom over the years by military means – but as our soldiers finally sweep over their lands, it seems their efforts are gradually coming to naught. That does not mean they cannot be useful, however – the Chendhyans of the Guaraddhi already adopted our ways once. Perhaps their cousins on the far steppe, and in the Mteibas valley, can be convinced to do a similar thing."

 J84_5_4_monuments_of_the_water_title: "Monuments of the Water"

Devand will soon fall – but if we are to invade Alecand, we must build a fleet of these ships, and finally beat the Kheionai at their own game."

They eschewed worship of the gods in favour of mortal words and sayings, drinking their wine and carving their pretty statues. Our elites indulged in some of their ways, sure, importing Paraidar wine and Potidhano glass – but they never fell to their mindset. As they sat secure in their prison-cities, engaging in petty skirmishes and trade wars, we fought cataclysmic wars, storms of blood and fire. Laskaris thought he would bring their ways to us – instead, we will bring the storm to them, and show them what is truly the “superior” people."

They may not be superior, but it is difficult indeed to say they are not our near-equal, and that naturally means we must begin to treat them not as hostile enemies, but valuable subjects.\n\nThere is another option, though. A voice that says that today they are our near equal, and tomorrow they may prove they are more than that. A voice that says not to take the risk. Says to break them, once and for all… and to seize the hidden riches beneath their precious cities for our own gain. But we wouldn’t be so desperate to consume what we have so recently gained, ruin future territories, just to secure our power today, and gain temporary riches… would we?"

The acquisition of the Kheions and their knowledge, however, has given us a much clearer impression of Amadia, formed from the back of Oktikheion’s legendary Amadian Expedition.\n\nIt is a land of wild magic, fractured tribes, and silver and damestear beyond imagining.

As our artificers crack open the secrets of the world, and our scavengers raise Ruin-Scrap from the graves of the past, we see a path to revival.\n\nA legion of Yodhans, shrouded in Ruin, armoured in antiquity.

 taychendi_empire_events.0.dmihaela: "It is normal for Taychendi rulers to model their reigns off those of past rulers, so that they have both a guideline for which policies to pursue in order to gain their own place in the heavens, and so that they can patronise a solid selection of rulers to help them do so. However, Mihaela is a vampire – possessing immortality, she will never see the gates of Dhivumanhu.\n\nInstead, her religious duty lies in her role of facilitating the apotheosis of her non-vampiric subjects. To that end, the style of her rule, and therefore the gods she patronises, encourages her subjects to follow that same path to apotheosis – naturally, switching up the style of her rule would be advantageous in dictating the direction of our empire."

 taychendi_empire_events.1.dsupress: "The Grandmaster, kneeling, bowed his head low as he finished his appeal. The Bloodcloaks arrayed behind him in the throne room, faces hidden behind their plate-and-mail helmets, shrouded in capes of dark red cloth, bowed in unison as well. On the millennial anniversary of the Ruin, Olhokar the Fortuitous had received a similar appeal – to grant the Brotherhood of the Bloody Cloak stewardship of the Chendhya.\n\nToday, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] was flanked by two trusted warlords – Teshekar Takasangamar stood to one side, Andyzha Vakyrlana, of Darkalyndar, to the other. Teshekar leaned in first. “These elves are noble, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. They’ve guarded the frontier for centuries – even during Gophira’s fall, they upheld their sacred vows, never took sides! My family have sent many of our members to join their ranks – I know they’ll make good stewards, loyal and true.”\n\nAndzyha scoffed at that. “These Bloodcloaks are villains, renegades! Simply the worst people imaginable! They use their “vows” as excuses to terrorise innocent Chendhyans for fun – if “protecting the steppe” means riding around cutting tents, slaughtering livestock and whisking away women and children as slaves, then they “protect” very well indeed!”\n\n“Slander!” the Grandmaster called, as he rose to challenge Andyzha’s words. “We work only to protect Taychend from the Chendhyan hordes! For fun? You think we exact pleasure from our work?” When the warlord of Darkalyndar ostentatiously mouthed a “yes”, the Grandmaster drew the Greatsabre hanging on his back. “The steel of vengeance knows no pleasure, you barbarous, cat-riding whore–! I’ll have your–!”\n\n“Enough!” [Root.Monarch.GetName] stood suddenly, and the hall calmed at an instant. The Grandmaster shrunk back at the admonishment. “The Brotherhood’s appeal…”"
 taychendi_empire_events.1.dsupressrakka: "Since the reign of Olhokar, our original patron, we have stood watch over the Guaraddhi, fending off countless incursions of raiders and cat-riding thieves over the years. But it was only with the rise of Laskaris and Erankar that we were spurned into the action that was truly necessary for our success – only by bringing Taychend under our control, could we truly save it.\n\nAnd so we did – and now, the second part of our goal has been achieved as well. Using the resources of a united Taychend, we have at last decisively pacified the Chendhya, bringing the tribes to heel and forevermore cementing our control over the steppe! Olhokar the Fortuitous surely smiles on us from his home in Dhivumanhu, for those under our protection can at last feel safe from the Chendhyan menace!"

Then, Ultarlan the Decimator arose.\n\nUltarlan united the Chendhyan tribes, and over the course of a decade conquered all Taychend. Though he was assassinated soon after, and his son Geladhlan – variously known as both “the Stoneburner” and “the Emancipator” – would fall victim to inter-tribal feuds, his empire collapsing with his death, the leftover Chendhyan kingdoms – Ezhudars – remained in power for decades. It would be these remnant kingdoms that would truly see Chendhyans adapt to Taychendi ways.\n\nBy the time Olhokar the Fortuitous rose and swept the remnant kingdoms away, a significant proportion of the Chendhyans in Taychend had adopted Taychendi religion, fighting wars for glory rather than simply defence. Most importantly, they had also adopted slavery – though they would never stoop so low as to enslave other Chendhyans, these “Chainforger” Chendhyans became active participants in the Andeiosian slave trade, selling Taychendi or Kheionai captives taken in raids to whoever would buy them.\n\nBe it the Ezhudar of Zaernmaera, who ravaged the Taychendi frontier in the early 1400s, Darkalyndar, who have served the Gophirans faithfully for centuries, or the Haebyziae tribe, who formed the backbone of Oremvand’s military, these Chainforger Chendhyans have proven themselves powerful and amenable to our ways time and time again. Perhaps we can cultivate this strength, and either give them more autonomy or sponsor the further adoption of Taychendi practices among their people?"

When they had reached the pinnacle, he surveyed the army before him. Tens of thousands of Chendhyans had gathered on the plains, all for one purpose, all under his direction, and all for one reason. Alazhlan, Asadezheg of Saerraeg – the King of all Chendhyans – raised his sword towards the sky.\n\n“Chendhyans!” he called, and a roar unending answered, every mount and rider below crying out for freedom. “The slavers have united! A new empire of warlords has arisen – and they WILL seek to invade us! Destroy our way of life! Take our lives, our land, our freedom!” They always did – it was their nature, and had been from the days of the ancient Slaver-Nobles, and would be until the day they purged the vainglory from their hearts. That would not be this day, though – so instead, they would fight. “A hundred thousand elves and more march for the steppe – but will we stand by and watch as they subjugate us?”\n\nForty thousand elves answered in unison, their voices shaking the very earth – “Never!”\n\n“They are many, and we are few!” Alazhlan called. “But will we let that cower us?” “Never!” “Death awaits us! But will we let that break us!” “Never!” The Chendhyans raised their swords and spears towards the sky in defiance. “They want to buy our bodies with gold – but what will be our price?” “Blood! Blood! Blood!”\n\nAlazhlan beamed, even as the pit in his stomach deepened. He pointed his sword to the east – to Taychend, to death, to the end of everything they treasured. “Then ride with me, Chendhyans! Ride to war! Ride to vengeance! Ride to freedom!”"

 taychendi_empire_events.3.d: "As Seluslavi translated her owner’s words from Yodhanpir to Kalavendhi, Galinpan Kattyva threw his arms up in exasperation. “I’m not letting you have their city! I’m giving you half the population as slaves, their wealth, their livestock, even the warlord’s wife and children! What more could you want?” Seluslavi stole a glance at the aforementioned warlord on the other end of the table, staring straight ahead, despondent, while his overlord – the one supposed to be mediating – sold him out.\n\nThis was a Periyodhai – a semi-ritualised battle, with predetermined stakes, fought between two relatively equal vassals of a greater warlord. Everyone knew “Hurahara the Humungous” would win, though, so they were really negotiating his “prize”. She’d been the receiving end of one of these negotiations – the village star, a scholar destined for the Dumran Vustarvach. Now she was a slave, and she translated, and read her illiterate master stories, and provided him “comfort” when he demanded. And she longed for death, and never had the guts to seek it, and so Seluslavi translated.\n\nHurahara fumed, tried to control his rage for a second, then burst. “I WANT HIS CITY!” he boomed, as he slammed a fist down on the table so hard it nearly upended it. “I WANT HIS PEOPLE! I WANT THEM ALL!” The Kattyva didn’t need a translation to sigh in exasperation. It was easy to see what the Royakottari warlord desired. He had overextended himself in Yodhanchend looking for relics, and he wanted multiple reliable warlords to hold his lands there, not one ignorant brute called Hurahara the Humungous, whose neglect would ruin scavenging operations there for a generation.\n\nBut Hurahara was crazy, crazy, crazy, and he just didn’t care. The Kattyva finally gave in – and soon Seluslavi was translating that too. Hurahara seemed satisfied – Galinpan Kattyva silently counted up the costs of a military expedition. If the Kattyva won, she’d be sold off, taken by some saner lieutenant, maybe. Or she’d be killed when they took Hurahara’s home city. She’d like that. Tomorrow, she knew, the people in that warlord’s town would be wishing the exact same thing."

The massive hall, carved deep into the hills, was bathed in the blue glow that emanated from the great damestear-jewel at its far end. Beneath it, at the apex of a pyramid of smooth-stone steps, hung the skeletal corpse of the Fateweaver – its arms outstretched and skull wrenched back, pierced with the relic-threads of prophecy, tendrils of ruin-steel that rose to the crystal above.\n\n“Beautiful, is it not?” the Threadbearer asked, as she walked up besides the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. “We ought to go closer.” It took them a few minutes to reach the base of the stairs.

The world weeping blood– by the gods, the crimes… the terrible crimes!” The Threadbearer threw her hands over her face to hide her tears.\n\n“Gods…” [Root.Monarch.GetName] muttered, “why must you toy with us so?” [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] stepped back, turned to the jewel above. Rage and terror mixed in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] heart. “Damnable fate! You give us portents but no prophecy! WHAT MUST WE DO!?”\n\n“Tacenie…” the Threadbearer whispered. [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s head snapped back – the Threadbearer’s arms fell limply by her side. She looked off into the distance. “I saw Tacenie, rising above.” Then turned towards her [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. “And then it fell, and the flame of Ruin shattered the world. And you were watching, staring…"

 taychendi_empire_events.7.t: "Mechanical Hearts and Grinding Gears"
 taychendi_empire_events.7.da: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] saw blurred images, visions, snapping from one scene to the next. Mages and tinkerers, most Taychendi but some strange, short or scaled, worked in laboratories, unearthed underground chambers, artefacts. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] saw a kotakompu being pulled apart and reassembled in steel – the tortured beast noticed him and pounced. Then all dark – and the pulse of beating blood and whirring, crackling mana surged around [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]. Then the darkness cracked, and with the tearing of flesh and the whirring of steel, the walls of red-iron tore away – and a monster, a beast bigger than any the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] had ever seen before, revealed itself. It rose through the storm, reality warping around its immensity, incomprehension digging into [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s soul.\n\nThe [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] snapped awake from the communion with a start, staggering back. “Be careful…” the Threadbearer said, as her hand steadied him, “the first time is always difficult. What did you see?”\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] wanted to say that [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] didn’t know. That [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] hadn’t the faintest idea. That the world was upside down and left was right. Then [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] took a deep breath, got a grip, and simply said whatever came to mind. “I suppose… I saw mechanical hearts and grinding gears, chambers reliquary and valves mechanical. I saw Taychend pulse with the damestear-blood of magic, the world torn apart by the ambition of… of…”\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] felt a presence behind [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] – though even as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] turned, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] knew there was nothing there. The ambition of ourselves, or of those of the past? The lines seemed to shift and blur before [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim], past and present and future ill-defined."
 taychendi_empire_events.7.db: "The communion was over in less than a minute. In a heartbeat, everything suddenly stopped – the Threadbearer released her hand from the Fateweaver’s corpse, and the raw, rushing power of magic ceased, motes and wisps all that remained. After taking a moment to collect herself, she turned and descended the steppes silently. She looked troubled, anxious even.\n\n“So?” [Root.Monarch.GetName] asked tentatively. “What did you learn?” Was [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] empire to fall? Would [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] need to sacrifice [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] firstborn son? Would [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] be unkillable until [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] turned 61 years old? Or would [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] see unparalleled success? Glory and riches unrivalled?\n\nThe Threadbearer paused for a moment, as if troubled, then finally gave the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] future. “Your mages, your scholars, your scientists… the brains of Taychend will be pushed to their limit – and in doing so, the very seams of nature shall be torn apart, the divide between hot blood and cold steel muddying under our power. And with mechanical hearts within, and the sound of grinding gears behind…?” The Threadbearer looked away from [Root.Monarch.GetName] – past [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim], as if whatever she had seen in the prophecy was behind the Emperor. “You will confront forces that will stretch comprehension itself.”\n\nThe Threadbearer shook her head as if to clear it, then turned back to [Root.Monarch.GetName]. “I am sorry, the communion was tiring… please, leave whenever you see fit.” Then she hurried off, and the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] was left alone – the past glowing bright before [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim], and the future towering high behind [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]."

 taychendi_empire_events.8.d: "Camnan looked on sullenly as the victorious soldiers marched home. He could see friends and family all passing by, brandishing wounds and bloodied weapons with the same vigour and cheer. Their town had won a series of Periyodhai recently, their warriors besting all the neighbouring city-states – Gadivelgar and Ulmukilavand and Denvephirsi. And while they won glory, he’d been stuck at home, jewelling. Camnan looked down to his withered legs – and the wheeled chair that held them.\n\nThe jeweller heard a loud tut from behind him. “Each parade, I find you in such a state. Must you wallow in regret like so?” Camnan turned – Jalinwathi, the local priest of Elajith, and a member of the Violet Brotherhood, stood, arms crossed and a faint smile across his face.\n\nCamnan shrugged, frowning. “My friends win glory on the battlefield day by day – why, Varanran has slain so many foes he may well ascend! Meanwhile I’m stuck here… tinkering!” The jeweller looked to the parade again. “How am I supposed to attain glory if I can’t fight?”\n\n“The same way your sister’s writing grants glory, or old Trianran’s smithing – why, that elf made half the weapons used in that battle! You make wonders every month, and you still feel inadequate? Foolishness, Camnan, foolishness– there are many paths to ascension! And in Dhivumanhu, smith and soldier both drink from the same Pheni barrel!”\n\nCamnan scoffed. “Then why do we love war and battle so? The Empire marches east and west, north and south– how could you get more glorious than that?”\n\nNow it was Jalinwathi’s turn to frown. “Elvenkind has always craved the easy path. And blood and violence is easy… but sometimes it is being turned from the easy that allows one to seek the fulfilling.” The priest looked to the parade. “Perhaps Taychend will turn from the easy path one day…”"

 taychendi_empire_events.9.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] watched the Royakottari labourers from afar, as they finally broke into the core of Degakheion’s Windward – it’s Kheinilián. The blue glow of magic erupted from the steel casing. The harsh glow turned his eyes to the sky above – and send a wave of unease rippling through [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]. [Root.Monarch.GetName] turned to the woman standing to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] side, furiously scribbling in her notebook.\n\n“Are you certain we are safe, here?” [Root.Monarch.GetName] asked. “With the Windward gone– what if a storm strikes?”\n“We are safe,” Lelijitha Vustarin bluntly stated, not caring to look up from her notes. “We’ve done evacuation drills fifteen times… no, sixteen – forgot to count the false alarm. Any residents will die, but our labourers will be safely in Ormam before any disaster strikes.”\nThe Emperor shook [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] head, as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] turned back to the excavation. “Riches for us, fear for them, but it is ill-delivered – Degakheion was a proud city of glorious warriors. I should have chosen Oktikheion.”\n“And why did I counsel you otherwise?”\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] frowned. “Yes, yes, I know… my compunctions are exactly why it needed to be targeted. I see that, but even so…”\n\nThe Vustarin Matriarch finally looked up from her notebook. “The old Kheionai used to be mere prisoners of Tacenie, by my estimation. The Phylaxana were the last of their wardens. They clung to a long obsolete duty, a relic of the last cycle, just like – and forgive the slander – the Mudaliars. Unlike the Mudaliars, though, they used their ancestry to justify mocking the ways of all those opposed to them, even other Kheionai, like the Karkares they kept under “watch”. They never would have accepted our ways, and so they needed to serve as an example. Degakheion will forever remain a tombstone for Kheionai exceptionalism. A sign that our might, our fury, is more than equal to their ‘sophistication.’”"

It has been tough work finding all of the damestear-alloy conduits that pulse through the city, as well as to dig out the entirety of the massive damestear core of the city, the Kheinilián.\n\nNow, however, as the final shipments of Precursor steel and damestear sail back to Taychend, they have finally finished their task, and the city can return to its previous trade – though Degakheion is now effectively a “dead” city – a tombstone for the age when the Kheions were once untouchable, and its “citizens”, such as they are, will have to evacuate each time a Kaydhano Deathwind approaches."

A short fellow in a funny hat, “Sando Boltbrass”, led [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] around, as his assistants gave demonstrations of each invention. “Here– T-Wave transmitters, connects like lightning– oh, and speaking of lightning– sparkdrives! Any enemies? Bad doud? Pull the trigger and… toddo! Dead! And here... hmm, the “Maagikraftfayermaszeene”- thaumaturgical arcano-blaster cannon, yes? Supercharged a little, modified by me– it is… ah, not yet perfect, yes? Will backfire, mmm… 49.5% of the time? Needs a bit more “geelder” to fix, if you understand.”\n\nThe [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] understood perfectly. The other weapons and inventions interested [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim], and greatly – but they were single-target weapons. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] wanted devastation, and this arcane blaster thing looked like it could give him it. [Root.Monarch.GetName] pointed to the statue in the distance – and the palace where its head once stood. “Ebenanth, the First Emperor, decapitated that statue with a bolt from the Astral Sky. Precise annihilation – give me that, and I’ll give you more gold than you can imagine.”\n\nSando scratched his beard as he contemplated. “That… is difficult, yes… very difficult.” He called on his assistants, and they set to work modifying the canon, tinkering with the casing and the damestear within, aligning it perfectly – then, the gnome hooked up a string to a lever at the cannon’s back, and ordered those present to stand no less than 6.1 metres away. After a short countdown, Boltbrass pulled on the string and shouted “Danger-ho!”\n\nThe back of the blaster exploded. Half the artificers ducked for cover – but the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] was too transfixed on the magical bolt careening through the sky to care. It impacted the palace atop the Gathyanavaida and blew half of it into the sky. [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s breath caught – the power of Ebenanth replicated before [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] eyes. If this was the power of but a few Cannorian artificers, what could the Taychendi do with this technology? What new powers could lay beyond Taychend’s borders?"

 taychendi_empire_events.12.d: "After the wars of the Relic-Lord Kadradar, who unleashed a devastating plague on Andeios, fuelled by fell blood magics that turned elven disease immunity against itself, many Taychendi sought an escape from the chaos of their homeland. It was off the back of a Fateweaver-given prophecy that Darakash Threadsworn set off to the west, establishing a Taychendi “philosopher-kingdom” near Empkeios called Vadhipakvam, where he attempted to integrate Kheionai-inspired thinking into a Taychendi way of viewing the world.\n\nDarakash never truly fulfilled his dreams, however. His expedition had left carnage in its wake, and the incensed Chendhyans rallied against this new invader – not twenty years after its founding, Ultarlan the Decimator destroyed Vadhipakvam. Few Taychendi survived – none made it back home.\n\nBut times have changed. The Chendhya is pacified for good, and we now control the entirety of a land synonymous with philosophical thinking. Many are calling for us to attempt to recreate Darakash’s dream in our Kheionai territories, with this new Vadhipakvam promoting a mix of Taychendi philosophies that will better serve their new subjects – and therefore allow them to better serve our empire. Others still call for us to simply better garrison our Kheionai territories, and attempt to integrate them through might and power, rather than words and reason. Ultimately, the choice is [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s to make."

Well…” a slave passed the Vustarin a series of papers – she rolled them out on the desk, revealing a series of city plans. “Here is the location or supposed location of the Zopedan cores in each of the Kheions – we did a little investigating before Degakheion was agreed upon, just in case, but now that we know what they look like, how you can scrap your way to finding them…? Well, Arpedifér’s core is the only one that still eludes us, but we’ll get there – other than that the only problem comes in clearing out the areas we need to excavate.”\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] nodded as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] stared at the papers on the meeting table. The moment [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] laid [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] eyes on the final figures from the excavation of Degakheion’s windward, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] mind was set. The wealth they had dug up from those cities was simply astronomical… how could [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] resist the opportunity to replicate that success six times over?\n\n“My [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]?” Denariatam looked up. “Respectfully, I think you’re asking the wrong questions.” The Vustarin Matriarch put Oktikheion’s city-plan to one side, and unravelled a map of the Cleaved Sea. “It isn’t whether we’ve prepared to excavate – it’s if you’ve prepared for what comes next. The Kheions will rise in revolt… and if I had to guess, so would all Kheionai, everywhere. And the world will look on us like– well, we’d be pariahs for a time, I’m sure.”\n\nThe [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] furrowed [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] brow. “I didn’t expect you to question my morality.”\n\n“Not your morality,” the Vustarin pointed at Empkeios on the map, “your troop deployments. Threzaranthi Uyasmar would do more good in Oktikheion than Empkeios, and the Rakulacans… well, let’s just say this is going to take a lot of bloodshed, and they’ve proved good at it.”"

Were we able to control this process, we could have a tighter grip on Taychendi religion than anyone has ever known.

The northern jungle has many resources at its disposal, with monstrous fauna and vine-slave Seedthralls proving themselves more than a match for our regular soldiers – and to make matters worse, the Effelai has made a nasty habit of turning our dead into their puppets.\n\nWe have a solution to our plight, though – artificery. Our innovation knows no bound, and with our tinkerers and engineers crafting every manner of war machine, so too will our capacity for destruction. The only question is to what extent shall we unleash this new technology?

If not for Ishere’s quick thinking, Eestra would have been consumed as well.\n\nBut the fire wasn’t all she needed to worry about. A bull-like beast of the jungle charged from the darkness, straight at the wall of fire. One second Ishere was running for her life – the next she was sent flying. A snap cut her cry short. Eestra screamed, sprinted over and turned her sister over. She ignored the lifeless look in her eyes, tried to shake her awake – but it was too late. She screamed again, hugged her sister’s corpse tight to her chest, and began to wail. Her next scream was one of pain, not grief, as the fire claimed her, and her flesh crackled and boiled, and every nerve in her body was set alight and torn apart.\n\n– – –  \n\nUnatam tried to hold the Auto-Scorchray level, as he wrestled with the cord tying it to a Damestear core far behind him.

He was concentrating, focused – then, he saw something emerge from the wall of fire.\n\nAt first he thought it was a scorched tree stump – but as he marched forwards, unable to take his eyes off it, he understood what it was. A Effelai native holding another in her arms. Mother and daughter, maybe, now charred bone and blackened flesh. For a heartbeat Unatam felt shame – then he drowned it out with rage.

It was an ingenious system, one that forced each major warlord of the realm to bow to the Imperial power, one that reminded them of their true place in the world.\n\nThe Tailatam System, it was called. Amidst the death throes of the Second Gophiran Empire, its progenitor, Tailatam Sangamar, had employed it to great effect in the lands he controlled, binding the warlords of the Kalavend to him while he turned his attention to winning the civil war. It didn’t save Tailatam in the end, as assassins of the Na’Cailana slaughtered his advisors and generals, and left his movement in the dirt – but the Tailatam System signified the final form of Gophira’s hegemonic aspirations. The final step in their plan to make their rule over Taychend eternal.\n\nDenariatam Rakulacan would fulfil that plan. Here, they would kneel – and out there, they would obey. The warlords had enough power already, over [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] actions, over the Empire’s future, but [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] would not allow them to control the Emperor’s future – and [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] would not allow those who rejected that right to persist into the future either.

Hundreds of thousands of soldiers, armed with torch and sabre and Auto-Scorchray alike, stand ready to march north, and claim millions of miles of new land for the Empire of Taychend.\n\nThe Effelai knows this. The wailing song of the jungle pierces the canopy, as its vines pierce and puppet the dead itself – as hundreds of thousands of our soldiers pour north, a hundred thousand Seedthralls, alongside many of the jungle’s most zealous warriors, stand ready to meet us.\n\nClearly, the Effelai fears us. Let’s show it why it’s right to!"
 taychendi_empire_events.20.a: "The war against the Effelai starts now!"

 taychendi_empire_events.21.t: "Effelai Defeated"
 taychendi_empire_events.21.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] looked across the landscape in disbelief as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] wandered aimlessly. The voices around [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] went in one ear and out the other. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] had been at the forefront of the conflict, at the wall of flame that had put the Effelai to flight – and then slain it. For months, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] had lived in a world of smoke-choked skies and roaring fires, bloodied vines and mud-soaked steel. The war against the Effelai was fought in darkness – but now, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] saw its aftermath in the light of day – dimmed, of course. It still snowed ash.\n\nBefore the war, the Effelai had been a forest of tall canopies, webs of vine and silk and exotic plants and flowers, the green of the leaves fighting with red and pink and blue for dominance. Now, the ground was covered in a field of light grey, ash carpeting the soil like snow. And with the towering trees that had once blocked sun and sight gone, replaced with twisted, charred, hulking husks, it was as if the whole of the Effelai was laid out before him. A forest of blackened stumps, each a tombstone to the singing jungle, that went on for miles and miles and miles.\n\nSomething caught the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]’s eye – [Root.Monarch.GetName] halted, looking down at [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] feet. A green shoot sprouted through the ash. “The Effelai…” [Root.Monarch.GetName] asked, as a chill ran down [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] spine. “It’s gone? Completely?”\n\nThe warlord to his side raised an eyebrow. “That’s… what I was telling you about, sir.” [Root.Monarch.GetName] just stared at him blankly – the warlord started again. “We believe it has been crippled. Any above ground presence has been incinerated… but the Jungle’s roots run miles underground in some cases. Whatever we find we burn, but…”\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] laughed. All this, and it still persisted! They had burned the world, burned half the continent, and it still survived! The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] shook [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] head. “No, no– we’ve had enough burning. If you find any remnants, separate them, stem their growth – but keep them alive. We may have defeated the Effelai…”"
 taychendi_empire_events.21.a: "“...but that does not mean it can no longer be useful.”"

 taychendi_empire_events.22.t: "Effelai Victorious"
 taychendi_empire_events.22.d: "We have been defeated. We are beaten. We have lost the battle.\n\nTens of thousands of Taychendi soldiers drag themselves back over the Veyii Sikarhi, a disorganised mob – and they leave hundreds of thousands more behind, turned into the puppets of a beast of which they cannot even comprehend. The song of the jungle mix with the screams of the dying. Everywhere, elves ask “why?”\n\nSome also ask “how?” They lay the blame at the Emperor Denariatam’s feet, and accuse him of having blood on his hands and ash on his boots. Many of the warlords agree.\n\nBut that cannot be allowed to persist. Taychend has been beaten before – but we will not allow our Northern Expedition to become Ebenanth’s Western Expedition. This will not be our downfall, merely a setback in Taychend’s ultimate destiny.\n\nThe war drums beat once more, the sabres are sharpened, the fire is reignited. Today, the Effelai is victorious – tomorrow, it shall learn just how temporary that victory is."

 taychendi_empire_events.23.t: "A Demon, A Devil, A Flamethrower"
 taychendi_empire_events.23.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] shuddered a little as a fist pounded against the metal turret. “I’LL BURN YOU ALL!” A voice cried from within, rage dripping from every word. “I KNOW YOU HAVE CHILDREN GALINPAN! I’LL DRAG THEM TO THE INFERNAL PLANES MYSELF–! I’LL SKEWER THEM AND WATCH THEM COOK! YOU HEAR ME?! THEY’LL BURN– BUURRRRNNNN–!”\n\nThe lead engineer – one Galinpan Arihnai – gave a hearty laugh at the captive’s threat. “As you can see, the demon gets rather angry stuck in there.” The lead engineer stepped towards the turret’s “nozzle”, making sure to keep his head out of the way. “In fact, that is the secret to our system here, my [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] – a jet of flame, available on demand! Allow me to demonstrate.” One of Galinpan’s assistant artificers handed him a heavy, padded cowl – after he put it on, the lead engineer moved his head before the nozzle for a split second.\n\n“BUURRRRNNN–!” came the cry, and a jet of flame erupted from within. The top of Galinpan’s cowl singed, but the artificer escaped otherwise unscathed. Denariatam couldn’t help but be impressed at the display. The lead engineer walked back to the Emperor – and motioned for one of his companions to fetch a pre-prepared hunk of meat. \n\n“Using some of those documents the Ravelians generously donated, we managed to organise a successful capture operation. After that, it was just a matter of…” Galinpan looked back to the metal turret – the demon’s prison. “...Conditioning. Peeking our heads near the nozzle gets a guaranteed reaction, but we’re working on some additional trigger-points.” The lead engineer turned around, and signalled to his assistant, who very carefully dangled the hunk of meat in front of the nozzle.\n\nThere was a moment of nothing – then, a jet of flame flash-cooked the steak. Galinpan turned to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] as the assistant made ready to throw the steak in – and was then cut off when a much fiercer jet of flame incinerated steak and hand alike. Galinpan and the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] both grimaced as the assistant screamed in pain."
 taychendi_empire_events.23.a: "“May need a little more conditioning… but you have to admit it's powerful!”"

 taychendi_empire_events.24.t: "Chance to Hit: 50%"
 taychendi_empire_events.24.d: "The door to the throne room shattered – a moment passed, then Daranarma’s warriors, armed with all manner of scrap-artificer weapons and military gizmos, charged into the room. They were not met with any resistance. Jalinta knew his fate was sealed the moment he lost the Periyodhai – he’d made sure he would face his enemy alone. He grimaced as that enemy walked through the broken door, wielding a massive handheld cannon. The Techno-Warlord pointed it as Sajirada.\n\n“How lucky I am,” Daranarma started, “that you were not killed on the field yesterday! I’ve gotten a lot more testing out of my new weapon!” He had a satisfied grin on his face that made Sajirada’s blood boil. “This–” he turned his cannon to show the rainbow-like crystal that powered it, “-is prismatic damestear, straight from Amadia!” He had heard of these things – powerful but wild, chaotic. ”It packs a punch, my friend– want to see!?”\n\nThe Techno-Warlord levelled the cannon at the seated warlord – as the barrel began to glow with prismatic light, Sajirada readied himself for the end. But when the weapon fired, it was not Sajirada who was claimed by it. An explosion of prismatic light erupted from the back of the weapon – and the right half of Daranarma’s upper body exploded with it. The Techno-Warlord flew through the air, alongside a shower of giblets and gore. His mutilated corpse hit the floor with a wet thump.\n\nDaranarma’s men looked at the corpse, then at each other, and then broke, fleeing. Sajirada could hardly believe his luck. He climbed down from the throne and walked over to the weapon that had both doomed and then saved him, picking it up. Suddenly, an idea came to mind. The weapon packed a punch, but was dangerous to whoever wielded it… so what if whoever wielded it didn’t matter?"
 taychendi_empire_events.24.a: "Critical Failure! Daranarma was hit for 281 hit points."

 taychendi_empire_events.25.t: "Cry Me A River"
 taychendi_empire_events.25.d: "“The monsters of the jungle were not “natural” as you’d understand it. We believe the Effelai used the same processes it employed to encourage the growth of its plants and roots to encourage the growth of its animate creations.” The artificer gestured to the elf in the testing chamber, seemingly sedated. “By taking those processes and introducing them to our own subjects, we believe we can replicate the Effelai’s… creative abilities.” An assistant entered the testing chamber, jabbed some sort of needle in the ruinborn’s neck, then rushed back out. The door slammed behind him.\n\n“We’ve tried it on plants, kotakompu, oxes.” The ruinborn jerked awake – then began to writhe around in pain. “All trials were… highly effective.” There were gasps in the observation chamber as tumours seemed to sprout across the subject’s body, his muscles bulging, expanding. Muffled screams could be heard from behind the iron-barred glass, as cords of muscle sprouted from the elf’s body – red at first, though they quickly turned green. Flowers sprouted from the vine-like tendons. “Muscle growth was particularly exceptional.”\n\n“He does not seem controllable,” the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] commented, as the test subject slammed his head against the ground repeatedly. Blood and bone splattered across the chamber floor.\n\n“Oh, absolutely,” the artificer admitted, “but in a way, that’s the point.” He nodded to one of his assistants, who tapped on the viewing glass – the ruinborn’s head snapped up, then the beast lunged forwards, pounding against the glass even as his body continued to tear itself apart. “These are not precise instruments. Inject them, deploy them, and they will destroy all in front of them before they expire. Suicidal, short-lived… but quite deadly.”\n\nOne of the warlords in the room turned to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], horror written across his face. “To subject living beings to this monstrosity is– it’s an insult to all who died fighting the Effelai! We fought to destroy that thing, not revive it! How could you–” The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] cut him off with a glare."
 taychendi_empire_events.25.a: "“They did not die for an ashen waste, but for glory. At any cost, we will claim it.”"

 taychendi_empire_events.26.t: "Plant Misbehavin'"
 taychendi_empire_events.26.d: "When we began “producing” imitation Seedthralls, we believed them to be easily deployable, disposable shock troopers. When we began to introduce Effelai growth stimulants into some of our agricultural fields, we foresaw all positives and no drawbacks, our crops growing taller and fatter than they ever had before. Both of those assumptions, it seems, were misguided.\n\nThe Effelai was complex beyond imagining, its true nature likely known only to itself. With the jungle defeated in its home territory, cut down to a few scraps clinging to its heart, we thought we could harness its near-corpse, and thus effectively lifted the methods it had used to expand wholesale. Unfortunately, we seem to have neglected just how much of the old singing jungle we were bringing with us.\n\nAcross our empire, it seems that the various Effelai-influenced plants and Seedthralls have been taken back under the control of the remnant Heart, and are now going berserk, with plants rapidly spreading and consuming farmers and villagers alike. The means by which we produce imitation Seedthralls have been hijacked, and entire towns have been converted to mindless monstrosities. While we have desperately tightened the security around the Heart of the Effelai so that this does not happen again, we will still have to clean up the out of control plants."

 taychendi_empire_events.27.t: "Of Strength and Honour"
 taychendi_empire_events.27.d: "The chieftain fell to one knee as the fight finally left him. Cuts and bruises covered his body – and the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s. The fight had taken everything both of them had, as sabre, shield and warhammer clashed, an audience of tens of thousands of Ozgar Orcs and Taychendi watching on. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] felt half-dead, bones cracked and blood and sweat mixing as they dripped down his face – but even still, it was his sabre that was aimed at the orcish chieftain’s neck. [Root.Monarch.GetName] had won.\n\nThe chieftain looked up, straight into the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]’s eyes. “You bested me… a good fight, but you bested me…” the orc smiled despite himself – they had given both their peoples a show they would not soon forget. “Congratulations… chieftain.” The smile wore away as the Taychendi in attendance cheered, and the orcish now-ex-chieftain understood exactly what he had lost. This was an Ozarm Chadash – and now, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] found [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] the undisputed master of all orcs in his realm. The Taychendi elf took [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] sword away, and turned to the crowd.\n\nThe orcs had looks of existential fear written on their faces. Their existence hinged on [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] decision now. Many of the warlords wanted to “repossess” the orcs – apparently created by Ducaniel, the scion of Aesadas, so recently rediscovered but already regarded with a mix of awe and derision. Some of those wanted to put them to work in the mines and plantations, as the Cannorians had done – but was that not a waste of their martial abilities? Others wanted to induct them into a specialised force of auxiliaries, send them as shock troops against our enemies. There were those still that wanted to simply leave them alone. Had they not suffered enough?\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] supposed [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] was the judge of that, now. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] called to the crowd – “Orcs of Taychend…!”"

 taychendi_empire_events.28.t: "The Power of Yodhan"
 taychendi_empire_events.28.d: "The Sajirada’s jaw dropped as he walked into the entrance hall – one of his bodyguards retched as they saw the carnage. The corpses of his soldiers were strewn about, mutilated, ripped apart, smashed in. Blood pooled across the floor, spattered the walls. It was like some terrible beast had rampaged through – and had left a horrific trail of death and devastation in their wake, that continued all the way through the Sajirada base. They’d done well for themselves since their late patriarch Jalinta had turned them into feared Techno-Warlords, expanding their territory, their influence, their manpower. Now, something had turned all that inside out – hundreds had been killed, and seemingly without any casualties.\n\nFinally, Sajirada and his men came to his throne room. The trail of blood and gore led right up to the golden chair at it’s head, the twenty corpses that surrounded it – and the armoured figure that sat atop it. The armoured elf was seven feet tall, covered head to toe in jagged Precursor-steel plates, Damestear glowing beneath them. The hulking figure stood up, and cracked its knuckles.\n\nThe Techno-Warlord ordered his soldiers forwards – and then watched in horror as they were torn apart. Gunfire, sabre slashes, magic bolts, all had no effect. The steel plates, already coated in gore, were painted a deeper red. Finally, only Sajirada was left. The armoured figure advanced, swiped the warlord’s weapon away, and threw him to the floor. It stood over him – then the figure removed their helmet.\n\nThe warlord stared in disbelief. Towering over him was the face of Selurana Vustarin – the fifty-something, bookish matriarch of the Vustarin family had torn through an entire army. “That’s impossible! What is this– this power!?”\n\n“I believe,” the Vustarin gloated as she readied the killing blow, “this is the power of Yodhan! And to think, it took a Thekvrystana to finally unlock it– and some Larankarha to test it on!”"

And the blood… all the blood. Even as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] mused on the realm [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] ruled, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] subordinates arranged new campaigns in North Aelantir, in Sarhal, in Insyaa.

Then, like Valkadevu on the wastes of Neraghul, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] understood. The other empires had simply misunderstood – glory is not some ambiguous thing. Glory is Violence.\n\nIf the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] would not kill, end, conquer, annihilate then the warlords would do it for them. And so you be the sword, or face it. And so Taychend would march, and destroy, and drink the blood of the unconquered world until they could drink no more. Then? Maybe they’d all turn on each other, rend the Empire apart for the ichor of ascension that pumped through its veins. It didn’t matter. The Cycle of Glory – the Cycle of Blood – would be over, and Taychend would have already ascended. An Empire of Violence, and an Empire Vainglorious..."
 taychendi_empire_events.29.dvampire: "Mihaela strolled through her trophy room in Nanru Nakar, inspected the glass cases. They were filled with keepsakes from every threat Taychend had ever faced. She’d only faced a fraction herself, but it didn’t matter. This empire was hers – and that meant its victories, its glory, and its valour were hers too. The Kamrayakval’s Armour, ever black and imposing; an Erythe mist generator from Degakheion; a prismatic idol from Amadia; the green-flamed sword of Munakles… it was all her property. Her right.\n\nShe stopped at the display that held Laskaris’ helmet and armour,  The armour was a total forgery, but if it looked right, and felt right, who really cared? The helmet was definitely real, though. Sometimes Mihaela took the panoply out to wear it around – she could almost feel the confidence drip from the steel, see Laskaris’ victories play out before her. It was almost funny, how knowing when you’d die could be so similar to immortality.\n\nBut that was the trick, she supposed. The “why” behind the Taychendi first tacitly accepting her, and then cheering her name as she sent them to go and conquer. Who cares about the specifics? Who cares that your Empress drains the blood of a few innocents to survive, when your Empire consumes millions to keep afloat? Who cares if your ruler is foreign, when they rule just as a native would? Why care about controlling others when it gives you the ultimate freedom?\n\nMihaela sighed, turned and sat against the glass. For a moment she wished she’d figured this out a few centuries ago – but she knew that if she’d joined her child’s war, she’d have joined him in defeat too. Now, she had everything he’d wanted and more. Mihaela could do whatever she wanted… and there were a lot of things she wanted to do. And so the Empress rose – and with her, the empire.

Taychend had far surpassed the heights of prosperity they reached under the Second Empire. The Ironblood Army was so large as to be uncountable, so powerful as to be undefeatable.

It was as if all their wishes had been granted, but in the worst possible way. More tales of glory, of all kinds, were published in the Violet Library by the year, but their words were written in blood.

Do you think she’d like the bloodshed, the constant warfare?”\n\n“She was a warrior!” Kilaiek replied. “Of course she would!”\n“How could we know?” Kriadvai responded.\n“Does it matter?” [Root.Monarch.GetName] asked. The other two cousins looked askance at [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]. “It’s been over a millennium since she lived – and in that time, this city, this family… we’ve grown. Evolved. The way we rule those below, sitting up on the high chair, above the warlords – that was not Liandarha’s vision, that was Varanash’s! The way we rule ourselves, split into three and then rebound – that was not Liandarha’s vision, it was the vision of Triandar and Elechana and Pelozhil!”\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] looked up at the statue. “Liandarha was born amidst the skies, tethered to the light and order of Dhivumanhu… but she died in darkness, in a world of glorious chaos. That is the world in which we live and over which we reign… and it is through glory, and through chaos, that we shall end this cycle, and return the glory of Liandarha’s age to Aelantir. We will rise, an Empire Vainglorious…”"

 taychendi_empire_events.30.t: "The Speech at Teramzadai"
 taychendi_empire_events.30.d: "Munatam had stood alongside a hundred thousand soldiers that day, on the fields of Teramzerai. A force commanded by the greatest warlords of the Empire, and led by the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself], a grand invasion force that would soon set off for the lands of the Lizardfolk. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] gave a speech, elucidating the higher purpose of the war. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] talked about how the Precursors had once sundered the Lizardfolk, “usurped the golden scales”, burned their civilisation to the ground, and how by repeating and surpassing their conquests they could prove they had matched the might of Tacenie and Aesadas. When the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] had finished, Munatam cheered, chanting “glory!” alongside the rest of the army.\n\nBut in his tent that night, Munatam turned to his comrade as they were getting ready to sleep. “Ishran…” he said, “did you understand the speech today?”\n“Not a word,” the Chendhyan replied, chuckling. “Do you know who Ae-sa-das is?”\nMunatam shrugged. “A flying city I think? That’s what Tacenie was. But I don’t get how this is supposed to be any more glorious than a normal war. I mean, in this “Golden Scales” thing, the lizards had a big empire… but they’re now divided, weaker than they would have been… right? And the Slaver-Nobles… was it even difficult for them? Surely we would need to–”\n\n“Ah, Munatam!” Ishran cut him off in exasperation. “Stop wasting time thinking about things that don’t matter. We’re here to fight battles, kill people, and loot everything or everyone not nailed down. That’s our glory– what more do you need?”\nMunatam shrugged, looking down. “Well… I don’t know. Just wanted to understand, that’s all.”\nIshran laughed at that. “Believe me, Munatam – you probably understood the speech better than the person who gave it!"

 taychendi_empire_events.31.d: "“The city took a few weeks to take, but that was expected. Hard fighting, but quite a few good duels, glorious moments – I attached a list for you of the relevant regiments, soldiers, warlords, in case you wanted to celebrate any. Also seized massive stocks of psychoactive substances, Marhed Rayodana will love the stuff. About half the city dead, the rest enslaved. About a hundred thousand bound for Taychend. Lizardfolk are good swimmers though, and when we’re still near shore some try and jump overboard – requesting some more gunners to counter.”\n– Denarion Vitakes, Siege of Nazhni Report\n\n“There were a few snags. The lizards conjured up a storm on approach. By the time we got there, the troops were riled up. We took the city fine, but then the soldiers got off the leash – I tried to restore order, but when they started smashing up all the egg clutches things got messy. I just gave up after a while. I’ll write a full report later, but about 90% dead? Blood flowing down the streets etc. etc. The rest either escaped or were caught by us. We didn’t take many casualties, though – and we stripped the city clean. I directed a shipment of sapphires directly to the Palace, as you had instructed.”\n– Ultatam Achyavar, Siege of Khugra Report\n\n“Heavy use of evocation magic and artificery, employed similar instruments to that used in the Effelai. TOO SUCCESSFUL. Floating harbours incinerated in an hour, ZERO slaves recovered. Will need to dredge metal, gold from the water. Rest of the city put up too much resistance, lost control of soldiers. Captured 10 to 20 thousand slaves, rest killed, mostly by fire. 200, 300 thousand? The city census you gave me was probably exaggerated. I told you Auto-Scorchray is OVERKILL for urban environments. No historical/distinguished duels, events of note. Karassk champions all piles of ash – good job!”\n– Arichanna Vustarin, Siege of Karassk Report."

 taychendi_empire_events.32.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] grimaced as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] looked at the spire across the lake, a lance of black stone piercing the sky. The remnants of another ancient empire, whose power went beyond [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] comprehension. The ancient Lizardfolk had apparently had the strength to conquer other worlds, travel through the Astral Sky. If these spires were how they did it, then they may well soon find out how – at great expense, the technology within the spire had been stripped out, and shipped off to Taychend for study. When they had conquered the world, would the destiny of the Lizardfolk be [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] own empire’s too?\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName]’s assistant relayed to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] that the preparations were ready. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] looked at the thousands of warlords and soldiers around [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] – and the abjuration mages ready to shield them from the debris. The Lizardfolk’s destiny was to conquer other worlds – their fate was to be annihilated in a storm of magic and fire. A few thousand years later, those who destroyed them were themselves annihilated. Perhaps the Precursors usurped more than just the Lizardfolk’s golden scales. Maybe [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] own realm would too. [Root.Monarch.GetName] turned to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] assistant, gave the order, then turned to look back at the spire as the elf sent a message over her T-Wave Transmitter.\n\nAt once, the abjuration mages cast their magics, as a shimmering ward appeared over the crowd. Soon after, a bright light flashed from the base of the Spire of Zerat, escaping the entrance to its blackened halls – over a few seconds, more flashes burst through the spire’s walls, as if it was being devoured from within. Then it could bear the force no longer, and the spire burst. The warlords cheered as a massive blast of red and blue and orange turned the spire into a shower of blackened shards, thrown up into the sky and then hurled at the ground like javelins. One smashed against the ward above them, shattering into fist-sized fragments. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] smiled."

 taychendi_empire_events.100.d: "In times of war, those warlords who live on the borders of our territory are at a natural advantage, often being given lands along their frontier to raid and plunder. In times of peace, however, half of their potential targets are cut off, their overlords unwilling to risk an all-out conflict. Usually, they are forced to make do – sometimes, they decide to take matters into their own hands.\n\nAcross our border with one of our neighbours, a coalition of border warlords have launched a series of unsanctioned but successful raids on enemy territory. While some call for a non-reply in the hopes of not provoking the other side, others say that we should indulge them, and declare war. If we were to take particularly harsh measures, we may be able to temper the destabilising nature of the insubordination – though perhaps at a cost to our Empire’s glory."

If we are to pacify the region once more, a lot of blood will need to be spilled."

Taychend is no different, although the fact that family members are so readily given military commands adds to the instability.\n\nRecently, an imperial scion, having spent much time on campaign and gained the personal loyalty of their troops while doing so, has risen up over some grievance or another, and attempted to usurp the throne. Though the Second Gophiran Empire was once riven by these familial conflicts, and eventually destroyed by one, this scion’s rebellion is too small to threaten the same fate – nonetheless, his rampaging army must be stopped."

Slave-servants to wealthy merchants or warlords often get away with “simply” daily abuse and confinement. Slaves on the personal plantations and agricultural estates of the extremely wealthy are often whipped as an “incentive”. If a slave is sent to a mine, it is a near certainty they will be worked to death.\n\nNo wonder, then, that if a slave sees an opportunity to escape their conditions, they will usually take it. As the Kheionai once found out, in times where the slave population is engorged, the conditions for escape and revolt grow – it seems our current situation has led to that very outcome. Across our empire, slaves rise in revolt, the success of one uprising only encouraging others. We will have to put this down, and with brutal force."

 #The Depths of Aercel - Event Chain
 taychendi_empire_events.200.t: "The Depths of Aercel"
 taychendi_empire_events.200.d: "Nanru Nakar – the greatest, largest and oldest city in Aelantir – was once named Aercel. The heart of Pre-Ruin Taychend, the city was Tacenie’s primary docking station, in which it gathered tribute from the Slaver-Noble vassals of the Precursor Empire and teleported them up to the flying city via the Vanetavanem. Naturally, such a massive city, which handled such a monumental amount of goods, needed a place to store them – and, like on their rural estates, the Slaver-Nobles preferred to hide such utilitarian necessities underground and out of sight. Over thousands of years, they built a vast system of underground warehouses, slave-barracks, reservoirs and sewers – alongside quite a few facilities they would rather keep out of Tacenie’s eye.\n\nAfter the Ruin, the city’s underground facilities were abandoned. The depths of Aercel became the Nakari Underground – a dangerous, winding warren of smooth-stone corridors, half-collapsed chambers and every danger imaginable. Every year, scavengers delve into the darkness – but, harassed by both dangerous wildlife and the mutated remnants of those slaves driven deep underground by Ebenanth, they have never managed to even remotely subdue the labyrinth. This expedition would be the first to truly attempt to reach the bottom of it.\n\nThere is one problem, though. Nanru Nakar has, is, and forever will be ruled by the Mudaliars. The most prestigious and wealthy family in Taychend, they claim descent from Liandarha Mudaliar herself, the Tacenie Precursor who was instrumental in driving the Slaver-Nobles from the city after the Ruin. With over a thousand members at any one time, they have their fingers in every corner of the city – a power that has not diminished with their fracturing into three branches following the battles against Erankar. The full support of the Mudaliar Cousins will likely be key to the success of the expedition."

 taychendi_empire_events.201.t: "The Undercity"
 taychendi_empire_events.201.d: "There are a thousand entrances to the Underground in Nanru Nakar, tucked away in side-streets, basements of Pre-Ruin buildings and sewer pipes – but most of these are small or treacherous routes, which only give access to the Undercity, the inhabited upper layers of the underground where the destitute vagrants and criminal classes of the city live, away from the attention (and protection) of the city guard.\n\nIn order to march a full expedition into the unexplored depths of Aercel – the Underwarren – one needs to go through Nakar Kriadvai. The district of ruins, Kriadvai is dotted with excavated passages to the Underwarren, specially expanded over the years to support larger expeditions. It is in these entrances, in their own little slices of the Undercity, that the Scavenger Guilds have made their home. They have already supplied a great deal of knowledge and expertise to this particular Imperial expedition – but apparently, they were not quite satiated with their compensation.\n\nAs the expedition prepared to descend into the undercity, they were met by a blockade of scavengers, demanding a larger cut of the profits – though they could simply be dispersed, the implicit threat is there all the same: if the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] denied their request, they could make life very difficult indeed."

 taychendi_empire_events.202.t: "Into the Dark"
 taychendi_empire_events.202.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] felt unease as the army halted at the edge of the Underwarren. The warm lights of the Undercity had receded, the harsh blue-white of targeted mage-light replacing them. Many Nakari citizens had gathered to watch them depart, eager to catch a glimpse of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], or say goodbye to any scavengers they knew in the army – as they had just been reminded, some were undoubtedly there with ulterior motives. To tail them, maybe pick some of them off, swindle them as the scavengers had done – the Underground was a lawless place, after all.\n\nThat didn’t bother the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], though. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] had ten thousand elves with him – a sizable number even on the field of battle. A number of the Mudaliars, alongside the King of Nakar Kriadvai, had joined him, alongside some other warlords who had tagged along, eager for glory. No, [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s real fear was the unknown. Steel, after all, could cut through flesh far better than it could cut through darkness.\n\nBut [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe]’d just have to deal with it – with a short speech and a flash of his sabre, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] called for the Expedition to advance further into the dark."
 taychendi_empire_events.202.a: "One way or another, they would uncover Aercel’s secrets."

 taychendi_empire_events.203.t: "A Precursor Armoury"
 taychendi_empire_events.203.d: "When the abjuration mages finally unwound the wards, and the artificers blasted through the smooth-stone doors, it was like walking into the past. The armoury was pristine, with white-washed walls, racks of Precursor weapons and shining sets of armour, interspersed with beautiful, bone-white statues of the elves of ages past.\n\nThen the statues – the Challúmata – came to life. As soon as they detected intruders, they awoke from their “slumber”, grabbed the nearest weapons to them, and charged, acting on commands issued thousands of years ago, by long dead masters. Animated through necromancy, the souls of the dead coursing through their metal bodies, their advance did not stop until they were dismembered, hacked or blasted apart – even then, their broken limbs did not give up, only stopping their unyielding crusade when the priests surged forwards and exorcised them.\n\nBy the end of the battle, the white walls of the armoury had been painted red with the blood of Taychendi who had tried to plunder it – but the defenders were nothing more than lifeless husks too. Now, [Root.Monarch.GetName] needed to decide what to do with its contents."
 taychendi_empire_events.203.a: "Sell the weapons and armour to the adventurers."
 taychendi_empire_events.203.b: "Give it to the artificers so they can use them in their gadgets."

 taychendi_empire_events.204.t: "Deep Elves Attack"
 taychendi_empire_events.204.d: "The Underwarren of Nanru Nakar holds many terrors, that have claimed the lives of tens of thousands of scavengers and vagrants alike over the years – the assassin-like Dey Vettaga, swarms of sheer-toothed Kotakompu, tank-like giant armadillos, idle or wandering Challúmata, and elves hiding in the shadows, who would much prefer their works out of the public eye – Cultists of Urazhil or devious blood mages. But those threats are not what the scav guilds fear the most.\n\nThe expedition was encamped when the pale ones attacked.\n\nThey spared no prisoners, they gave no warning – one moment the lookouts were starting into the darkness, the next they were fighting for their lives. The Kriadvahna, pale-skinned elves suited to the conditions of the Underground, are slight but fierce warriors. They have dwelt in the depths of Aercel for a thousand years or more, the descendants of the slaves who joined Liandarha Mudaliar in fleeing Ebenanth’s advance in the decades after the Ruin, and had not returned to the surface with her descendants.\n\nUsing their command over both magic and the Underground’s treacherous terrain, they are a formidable enemy – and seem to always have just enough numbers to make the life of intruders hell. As piercing screams and the rumble of mage-fire echoes through the camp, everyone must do their part, or else the Expedition may well face a very grim fate indeed."
 taychendi_empire_events.204.a: "Hold the line and fight them off!"
 taychendi_empire_events.204.b: "Fight them as best you can."

 taychendi_empire_events.205.t: "Demons in the Depths?"
 taychendi_empire_events.205.d: "It was a hard fought battle, but eventually the Kriadvahna were driven off, leaving behind scores of dead warriors, bone-pale white and Taychendi tan both. By morning, the Expedition had tallied its losses, packed up its tents and supplies, and readied to both move deeper into the underground, and face any more Kriadvahna attacks.\n\nThey were relieved, however, to not face any. As the expedition approached, any Kriadvahna scouts they were lucky enough to spot quickly fled – as they came across Kriadvahna villages and encampments, they found them deserted in a hurry. The deep elves did not even bother to take their belongings, which the expeditionaries happily helped themselves to.\n\nThe scholars and mages were astonished to find that the Kriadvahna – long thought to be merely mindless savages – actually had a strong material culture, shaped from the various items found in the Underground. Among their works of art were those of a more religious significance – most dedicated to defending against demons from above, but some against unknown terrors from below too.\n\nIn one such village, soldiers came across an area marked with signs of danger and caution, obvious even to outsiders – delving deeper, they discovered a strange altar, guarded by broken, exorcised Challúmata. There were intact scrolls atop it – and some are saying that the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] may be able to commune with whatever the altar was dedicated to."
 taychendi_empire_events.205.a: "Commune with it."

 taychendi_empire_events.206.d: "The Expedition had thought the Kriadvahna had been cowed, afraid of the might of the demons above. They advanced lazily deeper into the darkness, swatting away or shooting anything that came near.\n\nWhen the first calls of “Kriadvahna!” rang out, many thought it was just a raid, maybe an overeager lookout pointing out a shout – then the screams and desperate shouts, and the musket fire and mage-bolts and clash of steel and rending of flesh. Before even ten minutes had passed, the Exepditionaries understood what they were facing – why they had faced so few of the denizens of the Underground. They were not retreating, but regrouping.\n\nNow, tens of thousands of pale elven warriors attacked at once. Most either bore simple spears, slings, axes, or used their hands as spell focuses – their champions bore glistening Precursor armour and blades of enchanted ruin-steel. Each Kriadvahna fought tirelessly, desperately, as if their whole people was at stake, as if their world would end if they lost. They fought with wounds that would send most others crying for their mothers or the gods – climbing over the bodies of their fallen kin to keep up the assault. They had a single battle cry on their lips – “lai-dan-har!”\n\nIf the expedition does not fight with the same determination as their enemy, things are going to get very bloody indeed."

 taychendi_empire_events.207.t: "The Glow"
 taychendi_empire_events.207.d: "After a few hours, the fighting died down, and the Kriadvahna retreated. The expedition, bruised, bloodied, but alive, continued into the depths in a grim sort of silence. The Kriadvahna would not be coming back, not for anything – they wouldn’t risk extinction by attacking again. All that was left now was for the expeditionaries to discover what the Kriadvahna had so jealously guarded.\n\nThey found out soon enough. As they descended, the warning signs that had been found near that altar repeated – and grew more dire. The mages of the expedition complained of headaches – and of unnatural power, mana coursing through the air. A blue mist formed as the party advanced – then, they saw the writing. Most could not read it – but the scholars identified it well enough. “STAY OUT!” “DO NOT ADVANCE!” “DOOM AHEAD!” “BEWARE THE GLOW!” All written in an ancient tongue – not that of the ancient Kalavendhi, nor the Slaver Nobles, but of Tacenie.\n\nThe warnings came to a massive chamber, large enough to house an ancient dragon. The expeditionaries gasped as they entered – hundreds of thousands, maybe millions, of golden Precursor slave collars had been piled high in the vault, like how a dragon hoarded gold. Every single collar had a damestear crystal within, bathing the room in a near-blinding blue light. There were four Kriadvahna champions in the room, wearing the silver-steel armour of the ancients, praying, kneeling. They turned, gorged on the might of magic, and charged.\n\nOnly after they had each felled scores of Taychendi soldiers were they dispatched – the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] himself, the Mudaliar-King of Nakar Kriadvai by his side, approached what they had once guarded. A single skeleton, clad in resplendent armour, laid against the foot of the pile of collars. A message had been written at her feet.\n\n“MY NAME IS LIANDIEL. MY CHILDREN CALL ME LIANDARHA. REMEMBER ME.”"

 taychendi_empire_events.208.d: "“Mother of my blood!” the Mudaliar-King cried, as he fell to his knees. “Mother of my blood, we have found you again!”\n\nThe purpose of the chamber was clear – this was the tomb of Liandarha Mudaliar, the once-mythical founder of the Mudaliar Dynasty, who descended from Tacenie to smite the Slaver-Nobles who had once ruled the city. In a way, it was also the tomb of the Slaver-Nobles themselves. The implements of their eponymous rule, their gilded slave-collars, as elegant and beautiful in form as they were brutal and domineering in their conception, had been stockpiled, hidden away. A fortune of gold and damestear.\n\nOn closer inspection, most of the collars were deformed, battered or broken. Many of their pure damestear crystals had been cracked, shattered. Having surely once glowed a bright white, even a thousand years later they still glowed a warm blue. And having been radiating their magic away for thousands of years, exposed to the air? The glow was poison.\n\nTo say that the expedition is divided on what to do with the tomb would probably be an overstatement – most are united on their desire to haul the collars to the surface, and scrap them for all they’re worth (though some mages would prefer they are given some for study.) There are some, however, who wish to honour what they believe is Liandarha’s wish, and seal the tomb. Though it seems there are some side passages that suggest Nanru Nakar goes deeper, no matter our choice it is unlikely we will be able to continue on."

 taychendi_empire_events.209.d: "Since we looted the tomb of Liandarha, we have been gradually selling off the gold and damestear salvaged from the ruined slave collars, selling them to buyers across Taychend. After years of profit, we have finally made our final sales.\n\nNakar Kriadvai, which had thrived from the salvaging operations for years, can now return to its previous trade of scavenging Precursor relics from the Nakari Underground."

 taychendi_empire_events.300.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] paced restlessly around the palace gardens, fists balled behind [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] back, gritted teeth pointed at the floor. It had not been a good week for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] – virtually everything [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] had been working on had seen one failure or another. Even when [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] lay in bed [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] struggled to think of anything other than the slights and the setbacks – and so [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] was out here, at an ungodly time of the night.\n\n“Trouble sleeping?” A woman’s voice roused the Emperor from [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] musings. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] turned, startled – then, as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] noticed a humanoid figure in the shadow of the garden, reached for the dagger at [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] hip. The woman in the shadows raised her hands in a show of peace.\n\n“What do you want?” The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] asked, as the woman emerged into torchlight. [Root.Monarch.GetName] could see her pale skin, her dark red hair – a Cannorian. “Who let you in!?”\n\n“Who let me in? Well, your guards, for one. Hmmm… your servants too. Your slaves… you get the idea.” The woman smiled mischievously. “It really wasn’t difficult, especially for someone like me.”\n“Like you…?”\nThe woman waved the question away. “Unimportant. I really came here for a… minor request.” She emerged from the shadows completely, now. [Root.Monarch.GetName] could see that her skin was like a bone-white. Despite himself, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] felt strangely at ease – like he was being lulled to inaction. “I’ve been looking to start a family – not with you! – and I need a place to call home.

 taychendi_empire_events.301.d: "The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] stared at the human woman sitting on the other side of the desk, her legs crossed, hands in her lap, a disarming smile on her lips, as if nothing had happened. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] wasn’t as naive now as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] had been 10 years ago, though. Since their last meeting, since the nameless woman had taken up residence north-west of Nanru Nakar, there had been disturbing reports. People disappearing, shadows hunting in the night, bodies found drained of blood – with fang marked necks.\n\n“You know why you are here, don’t you?” The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] asked. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] felt that same blanket of ease fall over him – though [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] tried to throw it off.\n“I believe I do.” The woman replied, calm as anything.\n“Then what do you have to say for yourself? In your defence?”\n\nThe woman chuckled. “In my defence? Nothing. The rumours are true. It’s all me.” The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] placed a hand on the sabre at his hip – how could one look so amused when admitting to murder? “I’m what’s called a ‘vampire.’ Have to feed, I’m afraid, or I’ll go all crazy. We wouldn’t want that, would we?”\n\nThe [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] grimaced. “Are you going to give me a reason not to have you killed?”\n\nShe laughed again – a belly laugh this time. “Oh, I’d love to see you try!” [Root.Monarch.GetName] stayed [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] hand – and tried to control [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] pounding heartbeat, and the chill in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] spine. “But I think I have a better idea! My name is Mihaela – I’m what you could call an Errant Prince. As in: I’m one of the most powerful of my kind ‘alive’. I grew… tired of the petty tyrants and traitors of my homeland. And now I’m here… and I think we could come to a very, very useful partnership indeed. If you reject me, I’ll vanish – you’ll never see me again. But allow me to build up my power, here in Taychend? I will give you more power than you’ve ever imagined.”"
 taychendi_empire_events.301.a: "“That does sound enticing…”"
 taychendi_empire_events.301.b: "“Absolutely not, to Cerachmanu with you!”"

 taychendi_empire_events.302.t: "Meeting under the Moon"
 taychendi_empire_events.302.d: "“You wanted to see me?” The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] asked. Mihaela stood on the balcony, staring out at the city beyond – she gestured to a full wine cup nearby, and [Root.Monarch.GetName] soon joined her at the railing.\n“Your land is so… beautiful.” Mihaela said, distant. “So many people clawing for glory, blood. Controlled chaos. A hunting ground for people like me… and maybe, for people like us.”\n\nThat “us” sent a shiver down [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s back. Mihaela turned to face [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]. She was beautiful, captivating… but it was never a “normal” beauty. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] doubted it was how she actually looked, for one – but there was also always something tainting her, always some emotion saturating the way she looked. Wrath, envy, malevolence… today, she was dripping with so much pride – so much vainglory – that [Root.Monarch.GetName] reflexively stepped back, a hand on [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] sabre. For the first time, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] did not see a partner, but a pretender.\n\n“When I first came to Taychend, I just wanted to live my life how I wanted, in total freedom. The chaos was so alluring – no Blood Court, no subordinates scheming to rule the shadows. But now I look out and realise what my children once did, what I tried so hard to reject… so long as you’re on top, control and chaos aren’t so exclusive. I think you’ve realised that too.”\n\nMihaela stepped forwards, raised a hand to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]’s cheek. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] froze at her touch. “I want to make you an offer – my final one. Put me on top. Allow me to ascend to where I’ve always been destined to be… and I will give you the freedom I’ve enjoyed for so long. The freedom of the hunt… the freedom of immortality… the freedom of Vampirism. And then? We will rule the chaos, side by side – and we shall rule it forever.”"
 taychendi_empire_events.302.a: "Accept her offer"
 taychendi_empire_events.302.b: "Reject her offer"

 taychendi_empire_events.303.t: "The Pale Queen Rises"
 taychendi_empire_events.303.d: "Moonlight illuminated the Vanetavanem’s throne room as Mihaela sank into the seat. Jaher, Ioriel, Garion? Those pretentious elves had thought to dominate Cannor – and now she’d stolen half their home continent out from under them! Not everyone had accepted the change in management, but she’d pretended to have found the “Bloody Hand of Kadradar” – an idea shamelessly stolen from that fool Silverspite – and cast herself as a Relic-Lord instead of some monstrous abomination. The Taychendi accepted it well enough, and now she was “Veliara, the Pale Queen.”\n\nMihaela took in the tens of thousands before her, and grinned as she imagined the millions outside. She was delighted to find the great houses and families of Taychend she’d read about in attendance. She spotted a familiar face in the crowd too – the Pale Queen gave Theodore sína Trinás, her fellow Errant Prince, a nod. The Blood Court would throw everything they had at her – but she wasn’t going to be beaten this time.\n\nThe former Emperor advanced towards her, crown in hand – too slowly for Mihaela’s taste. She stood, walked over, grabbed the crown, and then placed it on her head. The crowd was confused for a moment, as their new ruler walked back to her throne, then twirled on her heel to face them again. Mihaela drew her rapier, pointing it at the crowd.\n\n“Subjects!” She called. “For too long, you’ve been content with “normal” men ruling over you – well, no longer! This day marks the dawn of a new Taychend – one where my power is absolute! And in return…? Do you want glory?” The crowd looked confused, but some nodded. “Conquest?!” Now there were sparse cheers of agreement. “Riches?!” The response grew louder, fuller, as the crowd grew more excited. “Blood?!” And tens of thousands cried “Blood!” in response. “Do you want to rule the world?!” And the entire crowd cried “the world! The world! The world!”"
 taychendi_empire_events.303.a: "“So bow to me, and I will give you everything you’ve ever dreamed!”"

 taychendi_empire_events.304.t: "A Game of Shadows"
 taychendi_empire_events.304.d: "Theodore put a hand to his temple as he poured another glass of wine. “Everything that could have gone wrong has,” he complained, as he took a swig. “It's like we’re not even making a dent!” The Errant Prince had been in charge of the shadow war against Mihaela for 20 years. He’d tried every trick in the book, spent enough money on the project to bankrupt the Gnomish Hierarchy twice over, but Mihaela’s forces had thrown every plot and scheme back. \n\nThe other Errant Prince in the room, sitting on the other side of the table, took a sip from his own glass. “It has to be expected. The resources of half of Aelantir, her new clan…” Renaud sighed. “I have to say… Mihaela has not broken the Masquerade. As far as we know, she hasn’t told a soul that other Errant Princes even exist! Maybe we should just… give up?”\n\nTheodore scowled – angry at both his friend’s suggestion and how much he agreed with it. “The Blood Court is– they’re not happy, Renaud! I just…” Theodore shook his head, slumped back in his chair. “Gods… how could this have happened?”\n\nRenaud shrugged. “Mihaela’s a… predictable maverick. She’s been making the same mistakes her entire life. Remember the farmhouse at Gerbuta? When she–”\n“You think I don’t remember? She felt so sick she didn’t sleep for months.” She’d cried when she realised what she’d done – the only time Theodore had seen her do so.\n“And yet? She learnt nothing!” Renaud poured himself a glass. “And next you’ll ask: ‘what about her grief?’ Well… she hasn’t changed in 600 years! Why now?”\n\nRenaud sighed as he took out his notebook. “How about Orenkoraim again? There are some Sarhaly mercenaries I can have sent over...” Theodore nodded through the plan, though he knew how it would turn out. The Errant Prince downed his glass, and reached for the bottle again."
 taychendi_empire_events.304.a: "“Once more unto the breach…”"

 taychendi_empire_events.305.t: "Blood Ties"
 taychendi_empire_events.305.d: "Mihaela threw the body to the floor, wiped the blood off her mouth. The Pale Queen turned to her underling – the former Emperor was wiping blood off his sword. “Another night, another revolt, another band of hunters, another failure. I think dear Theodore is finally running out of tricks!” Denariatam simply nodded the comment away, then returned to caring for his sabre – Mihaela invoked her right, and his gaze snapped up. “If something is wrong, spit it out.”\n\n“I was thinking,” Denariatam replied, “about the Slaver-Nobles. You’ve read of them, yes?”\nMihaela laughed. “I might be foreign, but I’m not ignorant.”\n“Of course. Well, their immortality allowed them to dominate the world, keep it in order for thousands of years… us vampires have the same power, do we not? The Cycle of Glory is one of chaos… mortal elves clamouring for ascension. But we stand above. And so the next cycle would be–”\n\nMihaela held up a finger – Denariatam halted immediately. “A cycle of order, right? We’d be the new Slaver-Nobles, ruling over the masses, with total liberty, the ability to do whatever we want…” A wicked grin formed on the Errant Princess’ face as she spoke. Pictures of an immortal empire formed in her mind. “And with the world under my total control… I will finally prove the others wrong– do what my children failed to do, what the others don’t want me to do! Live as I was meant to!”\n\n“The Blood Court…” Mihaela raised an eyebrow – Denariatam was not supposed to mention them, but she let it slide, just this once. “Will they truly let you? There is one of you, and–”\n\nThe Pale Queen laughed away her underling’s concerns. “Please… the only thing the others care about is survival… and once I send Theodore back to them in his coffin, they’ll understand the right way to do that. He’s faltering… next time, he’ll face me himself.”"
 taychendi_empire_events.305.a: "“And then, Theodore shall see what power really is…”"

 taychendi_empire_events.306.t: "A Duel at Midnight"
 taychendi_empire_events.306.d: "Mihaela was in her trophy room in Nanru Nakar when Theodore sína Trinas arrived. When the Errant-Prince spotted her, his eyes narrowed. “Oh, Theodore…” Mihaela smiled, as she walked between the displays. “It’s been so long! Enjoyed your little trips to Taychend…?”\n“I have not.” Theodore replied. He looked the typical Roilsardi gentleman, a rapier at his side. The two vampires began to circle each other. “You rule over a stolen empire, in a stolen palace, filled with stolen relics. It makes me sick.”\n\nMihaela laughed. “Oh, does it now? You know what makes me sick? When I think of how the Blood Court tried to bind me, restrict my liberty– it makes me sick when I think about how you murdered my child!”\nTheodore’s anger flashed. “He murdered himself! You tried to restrain him, remember? Gods–! You’re just a bundle of regret and guilt and spite, aren’t you?! A little girl lashing out!”\n\n“That’s what you think…?” The Pale Queen raged too – but she contained it, then channelled it. “No… you just don’t understand. I’ve moved past your petty fear. Only I can see what is true glory! After this is done? After you all understand just what you’re dealing with…? My armies will march, and my ships will sail, and the very blood of the world shall fuel my conquests! And then, at the end of it all, I will stand atop Halann, the master of the new cycle! Empress-Autonomous!”\n\nTheodore stared at his former comrade, astonished, mouth agape. “What happened to you?” He whispered. Then he shook the doubt away. “No, no… I get it. I understand. You’ve gone mad… and this will be a mercy.” Theodore drew his rapier, then took a decisive step forwards – the glass displays shattered as his boot struck the floor.\nMihaela laughed. “My my–you’re actually approaching me?”\nThe Errant Prince pulled a silver-stake from his cloak. “I can’t torpor you without getting any closer!"
 taychendi_empire_events.306.a: "“Oh, Theodore…! Then come as close as you like–!”"

 taychendi_empire_events.307.t: "Its in the Blood"
 taychendi_empire_events.307.d: "The battle between Theodore and Mihaela lasted seven hours. Each took and dealt enough punishment to kill a dragon, as the battle between them destroyed swathes of Nanru Nakar. But Mihaela knew the terrain. Knew the rivers, knew the bridges, knew which properties she owned and which she didn’t. It was only a matter of time – then a failed ambush, a rapier’s near miss, a perfect counter and a desperate struggle, and Mihaela held a stake over Theodore’s heart.\n\nThe Vampire-Empress cackled as she pinned Theodore to the ground, her hair dishevelled, eyes psychotic in victory. “THERE–! I got you– I beat you! I WON!”\nTheodore gritted his teeth. “Tch– always the same with you, isn’t it–?! Nothing but gloating, arrogance–! What a sick joke!”\n“A joke?!” Mihaela lashed out, striking Theodore across the face. “You don’t know anything! None of you do! None of you know what it's like! Everyone failed me– everyone!”\n“You failed yourself! Time and time again– and now what, millions have to die because of that?! This is Gerbuta all over again! The farmhouse!”\nCharred corpses flashed before her eyes. “That– that wasn’t my fault! They should’ve– I didn’t– I–!” Mihaela struck him again, and again, and again. The world shook with every strike – but Theodore didn’t scurry away this time.\n“Our kind… we’re a mistake already, Mihaela… don’t add to it. Please…”\n\nMihaela raised the stake high. Theodore raised his hands reflexively – but she never delivered the coup de grace. “Is that what you really think?”\n“You know it is…”\nShe did. Mihaela grimaced as she saw old memories. Burnt castles, burnt bodies, and burnt bridges. “It's too late for that…” Mihaela admitted. “Far too late. You think we’re mistakes…? Fine. But I won’t be a failure.” The Errant Princess threw the stake away and stood, turned to walk away – Theodore got up after her.\n\n“What do you want me to tell the Court?” Theodore asked, as he raised a hand to his battered face. “They may come after you again…”\n“Tell them I’ll leave them alone… and I won’t reveal their secrets. And…” Mihaela turned to Theodore again, and smiled. “Tell them that when I conquer the world, I’ll give them all the order they want."
 taychendi_empire_events.307.a: "Eventually – after much debate – the Blood Court agreed to leave Mihaela alone."

 #The Echoes of Ebenanth - Event Chain
 taychendi_empire_events.400.t: "The Echoes of Ebenanth"
 taychendi_empire_events.400.d: "The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] sank into [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] padded chair with a sigh. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] knew temple dedications were necessary to show piety to the gods, but they were just so long and tedious – made worse when the Cult of Ebenanth insisted on [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] reciting the prayers [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself]. [Root.Monarch.GetName] just wanted to rest, sign off some unimportant paperwork, and finish [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] day with a glass of wine and a relaxing bath.\n\nThe Blue House, however, had other ideas. One moment [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] was happily procrastinating, the next the room was lit up by the light of magic, as a robed figure teleported into the room. The mage thankfully held up the sign of the Nila Tenvach – the foremost magical institution in Taychend – before [Root.Monarch.GetName] could call for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] guards.\n\n“I come bearing words from the Pinnacle, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle],” the mage explained. “The construction of this temple to Ebenanth in Pattivaram has proven to the Archmages that you have… an appreciation of the liege of our founder.”\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] chuckled. “Right, your founder Sulathrezhil… a key member of the conspiracy that murdered Ebenanth?” The Blue House worshipped both – it naturally led to some contradictions. “Well I do appreciate him, as all good rulers do – but I’m not sure what your point is?”\n\n“Have you ever imagined yourself wielding Starshear? The power to call down the energies of the Astral sky at your command? Annihilate entire cities? We believe that with your resources and our knowledge, that dream may come to pass.” The mage took a box out from his robe, placing it on the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]’s desk.\n\n“When Ebenanth met his end, the jewel that powered Starshear was shattered, divided into five shards – in a last ditch effort to save his life, Ebenanth attempted to “imprint” his soul onto his relic. He only left a whisper, an echo–” The mage opened the box, revealing a crystal shard that glowed a brilliant white. “–but an echo is enough. Ebenanth’s memories bind the shards' enchantments together…”"

 taychendi_empire_events.401.t: "The Search for Starshear"
 taychendi_empire_events.401.desc: "After the death of Ebenanth, the relic on which he based his power, Starshear, was fractured by his mutinous generals, who shared the Shards of Starshear among themselves. Though the “Council of Warlords” tried to rule Ebenanth’s Empire, they quickly fell, and the Shards first passed to the warlords’ successors, then to opportunistic scavengers, then to legend. But with our resources, we have the resources to make legends reality – we just need to decide how to make that happen.\n\nThe first option would simply be to hire masses of adventurers and have them comb Taychend – tried, true, but expensive.\n\nThe second option is to use powerful divination magic, by giving our court mage as many resources as they could need, employing our mages in scrying or improving their latent divination abilities, or perhaps relying on our capital’s traditions.\n\nThe third option would be to use an extensive spy network, by improving the nation’s external or internal intelligence capabilities, employing expert spymasters and giving them as many resources as they could possibly want, or perhaps relying on our capital’s ancient contacts.\n\nOf course, should the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] have a powerful being backing them, or be a powerful enough mage as to affect the whole realm, and have legendary skill in that magic, then they may be able to uncover the shards by their own power."

 taychendi_empire_events.402.a: "Restart the search."

 taychendi_empire_events.403.t: "Accession"
 taychendi_empire_events.403.d: "The first Shard had been held by the Blue House for centuries, seized from the plains of Parahechend. When the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] first touched the shard, it was as if [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] head was plunged into water, then pulled into the air another elf breathed, a thousand years ago.\n– – –\nEbenanth felt the jolt of every gallop as he rode through the ashen waste. Clouds of grey dust swirled in the air, half a storm. Even now, forty years after the Ruin, it was as if someone had drained the colour from the world. Starved trees rose from the arid fields, spine-like. Eventually, he arrived at a “city”, circled with mud-brick walls plated with scrap. Its inhabitants – dressed in rags and leathers, emaciated, near-soulless – looked up to the Slaver-Noble and his mount in awe. Most horses had been eaten for meat in the years after the Ruin – people had simply forgotten how to ride. But Ebenanth made remembering the old ways a point of pride – and spite.\n\nWhen Ebenanth finally dismounted before the fortified hall that served as Pattivaram’s capitol, and entered his father’s chambers, his hands balled into fists. Ultrathikeyan Starshear laid on his deathbed, withered and aged. He had shrunken into himself now, his muscles atrophied, dark-blue hair turned wisp-white. The sight – the knowledge that he had never been able to see his father in his ten-thousand year prime – made Ebenanth simmer with rage. He had been born twenty years after the Ruin, and eight years after the Slaver-Nobles had been driven from Aercel – their glory was now only a memory.\n\nEbenanth kneeled beside his father, head bowed in reverence, and to hide his anger. He was woken from his vigil by a tap on his shoulder – he startled at both the staff that had touched him, and his father’s gaze. The last wisps of once-immortal fire burned in Ulrathikeyan’s eyes, as he passed his staff to his son, looked south, and spoke his last words."
 taychendi_empire_events.403.a: "“Our city… our rule… our power… take it back!”"

 taychendi_empire_events.404.t: "Reclamation"
 taychendi_empire_events.404.d: "The second Shard was found buried in Ameion. Taken by the Ambhen government for safekeeping, it was lost during its sacking by Taychendi forces.\n– – – \nEbenanth rode through the city in triumph, Starshear on his back, as his lieutenant’s chariots rattled behind him. The bloody remnants of the rebels’ resistance were strewn about the avenues. He had only seen Aercel from a distance before now, the monolith of their past power. The buildings had not yet fallen to ruin – but forty years of neglect had made their mark nonetheless. The entire city was ash-stained, desolate.\n\nAt last, the Relic-Lord came to the piercing tower at the city’s heart. His father had told him of how they could send a ship’s load of goods up to the sky in an instant, with a snap of their fingers. “Tribute for our so-called-masters in Tacenie”. The words dripped with a venom Ebenanth rarely heard. His father did not talk much of the days before the Ruin – but he knew something had caused it, and that it was not the Slaver-Nobles’ fault. That was enough for him to put things together.\n\nEbenanth grimaced, even as he beheld the great chamber at the statue’s base. He had incinerated half of Liandiel’s army – but his victory was half-done. She had fled to the underground. With Aercel’s depths in such disrepair, it was unlikely they would be found – but unlikely they would pose much threat either. The more pressing issue was the rest of the scions of Tacenie – they had fled to the south, to that steel-fortress on the lower Kalavend, and the safety of its invader-loving, traitorous ruler.\n\nHe would have to ride against them too, and soon. After 38 years of exile, Aercel had finally been returned to its rightful owner – now, it was time to show everyone that the Slaver-Nobles were back…"
 taychendi_empire_events.404.a: "…and by Starshear’s power, they would reclaim all they had lost."

 taychendi_empire_events.405.t: "Annihilation"
 taychendi_empire_events.405.d: "The third Shard was found in the Larankarha highlands, lost when a warlord tried to conquer the Advakhalla.\n– – – \nEbenanth strode out into the arid fields below the waste, Sulathrezhil and Darandal behind him, and the Steel-Citadel before him. It was titanic, a testament to its ruler’s wealth and power. An ashen storm swirled above, strangling the sun, but the silver-steel plates that adorned its walls still managed to glisten.\n\n“Ah, the son of Ulrathikeyan!” A voice called from the Citadel’s battlements – even a wraith-like husk, the Slaver-Noble warlord still kept his commanding voice. “Come to add us to your new empire?”\nEbenanth studied the soldiers manning the walls – a hundred different colours adorned their heads. “No… I don’t think so! You’re a traitor Aldatarel! You consorted with the scions of Tacenie! The ones who doomed us all, stole our might!”\n“Doomed!?” The ancient elf readied a spell, alongside every battlemage on the walls. “This is no less their work than ours! But that won’t matter soon enough. The past is dying, Ebenanth! In a hundred years, Ducaniel’s name will be forgotten– and your legacy will be naught but ruin!”\n\nEbenanth simply scoffed, and raised his staff to the ashen skies. As mage-fire alighted the walls, Starshear’s prismatic jewel glowed a brilliant white, exploded into light, then went dark. Sulathrezhil surged forwards, cast a powerful ward around them – and then Astral light cut through the dark of day.\n\nWhen the bolt of light struck the Citadel, it ran it through clean. The steel rippled, the walls buckled, then light burst through every window, every opening – and then heat, and smoke, and starfire. The top of the fortress erupted, blasted open – and then the Steel-Citadel collapsed in on itself, the very metal screaming in pain. As Sulathrezil’s ward held, and the ash of his enemy’s destruction subsided, Ebenanth smiled."
 taychendi_empire_events.405.a: "And the past was buried in his wake."

 taychendi_empire_events.406.t: "Revelation"
 taychendi_empire_events.406.d: "The fourth Shard was found in the possession of a merchant in Oremvand. He did not have the arcane capacity to understand its true nature – to him, it was just another jewel.\n– – – \nDarandal struck the green-haired elf, sending him and the chair he was tied to tumbling to the floor. Blood sprayed across the smooth-stone walls. Ebenanth sighed as Darandal pulled the Imperial upright – they’d clearly been interrogating him for days. “Talk, Imperial, and it stops.” The child of Tacenie – a second generation elf, twice Ebenanth’s age – looked up to the First Emperor. “We’ve traced as many Imperials as we can. I know where Liandiel is, I know where Vaceran is, and the rats in the north. So tell me – where did you come from?”\n\nThe prisoner sputtered out a denial. “My mother never told me– Never! I’ve told you fifteen times… just believe me… please!”\nEbenanth’s grimaced. “You don’t want us to take another hand, do you?”\nDarandal unsheathed the sword on his back – the prisoner eyed the blade for a moment, then broke at last. “My… my family came from the west– the steppe. I was born on Tacenie… we were among the last to leave.”\n\nEbenanth’s eyes went wide. Every Imperial they’d found, hunted, had told them the exact same thing – Tacenie had been destroyed, its location unknown, remnants scattered. He’d thought it’d crashed in the northern mountains– but he’d been looking in the wrong place the entire time. “Where!? Where in the steppe!? Tell me!”\n\nThe prisoner closed his eyes, sighed. “I don’t know… when most folk left, the rest put a glamour over it – for protection... it's just another part of the horizon, now.” Ebenanth smiled, even as he felt his heart pound. If his family lived in Tacenie for even a year, that meant it was not only in the east… but intact. The last of the flying cities. Ebenanth turned to Darandal."
 taychendi_empire_events.406.a: "“Kill him, then follow me – we have an expedition to plan.”"

 taychendi_empire_events.407.t: "Ascension"
 taychendi_empire_events.407.d: "The fifth Shard was found in the ownership of a Cannorian adventurer, who had brought it to Anbenncost – it took an intricate heist by thieves of the Na’Sharan to recover it.\n– – – \nEbenanth sulked as he walked through camp, his general Keshelanar following close behind. The Western Expedition – the great incursion into the western steppes – had been a total failure. Even the public objectives hadn’t been fulfilled. While the overland route to the prisons of the western peninsular had been cut off in the Ruin, the descendents of the great slave revolt not only eluded his forces, but withered them. He had taken captives, massacred villages, but it could not recoup his losses..\n\nAnd Tacenie… only he, Darandal, and a few others knew of that hidden goal. He had thought he might be able to find it through trial and error, or at least divination – but he was wrong. It wasn’t politically disadvantageous, but that failure cut Ebenanth deepest of all. Now all he could do was sound the retreat.\n\nAs Ebenanth entered the command tent, he was surprised to find his generals assembled – and the meeting table missing. They had clearly smelt weakness, and pounced – but he understood that too late. The First Emperor pulled his staff from his back, but Sulathrezhil caught his hand with telekinesis – when Ebenanth raised his left to cast a spell, Keshelanar surged forwards and cut it off.\n\nEbenanth fell to the floor, gritting his teeth in pain as he clutched his stump. Starshear clattered to the ground ahead of him. Darandal righted him with his boot, then ran his sword through his back. As his blood pooled around him, everything he’d accomplished – the conquest, the destruction, the glory, the death, the ruin – flashed before his eyes. He had gotten so close… the rule of the Slaver-Nobles so nearly restored. But it would all be for nothing. With his last embers of strength, Ebenanth reached out to the weapon that had won him his empire…"

 taychendi_empire_events.408.d: "The Blue-House mage went down on one knee, and presented Starshear to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] – a black-wood staff, lined with ivory and ebony, and crowned with a crystal that shone a brilliant white, wreathed in a prismatic halo. Not the base wild magic of prismatic damestear – but a connection to the primordial chaos of the Astral sky.\n\n“Starshear requires a large amount of mana to use – you’ll only get about one cast per day.” [Root.Monarch.GetName] took up the staff, and just by touch felt the power coursing through. “But, well, I’ve always believed that in magic, power is superior to speed.” The archmage looked to their right – at the enemy city in the distance. “Perhaps it is time for a demonstration?”\n\nThe [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] turned to the city in the distance. As a crowd of warlords, soldiers, mages and notables looked on, [Root.Monarch.GetName] raised Starshear to the sky, closed [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] eyes, and called down oblivion. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] felt [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] magic surge, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] energy pour into the staff as the crystal at its peak flared with light. For a moment, [Root.Monarch.GetName] thought [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] was not powerful enough, as the muscles in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] body burned, and a line of blood dripped from [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] nose. Then, all at once, the crystal went dull – and the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]’s pain with it.\n\nAlmost two millennia ago, Ebenanth had sought to deny the inevitable. Turn the world back to the time of the Slaver-Nobles. But through the power of Starshear, he had only swept away the last remnants of the old world – through his death, and the destruction of all he worked towards, the last cycle breathed its last.\n\nThat power – the light of annihilation – now cut through the sky, now struck Halann with rippling force, tore apart the city before the crowd. The home of tens of thousands erupted into an explosion of light and heat and starfire, all within incinerated in an instant. Starshear’s fracture had heralded the true beginning of the Cycle of Glory…"

 #The Last City - Event Chain
 taychendi_empire_events.500.t: "The Last City"
 taychendi_empire_events.500.d: "It took hundreds of thousands of elves to search for the Last City. Each party, ten thousand strong and arms linked into a human chain five miles long, had their segment squares of the steppe meticulously marked out over months – you probably could have seen the effort from the Astral Sky itself. Soldiers stood side by side as they marched, combed over their assigned area. Then, when they reached the other side, they would rest for the night, mark that segment as completed, then hop over into the next square and repeat, over and over again.\n\nIt took five months to stumble on the Last City. Grazing animals were pushed out of the way, villages passed through – but most inhabited parts of the steppe were ignored. It wasn’t like Tacenie would be found in the same space as a village. And so, bit by bit, quadrant by quadrant, a Taychendi boot trod each inch of the Chendhya. When a party first stumbled on their target – first stepped through the glamour that had masked the flying city’s presence for a millennium, they found the city untouched – near pristine. It was as if its inhabitants had never left.\n\nWhen the Last City had been found, it took but 24 hours until every major warlord of the realm was closing in on its location – until the Emperor themselves arrived, and finally ordered the glamour dispelled. For the first time since the Ruin, the glory of Tacenie, the last of the flying cities, was exposed to the air.\n\nNow, all they needed to do was raise it to the sky…"
 taychendi_empire_events.500.a: "…and make it fall"

 taychendi_empire_events.501.t: "To You, $YEAR$ Years From Now"
 taychendi_empire_events.501.d: "Swing, step. Swing, step. Swing, step. The slave advanced, scythe of silver steel in hand, as the two slaves behind him picked up the maize he cut down, like clockwork. He did not even pause to move a stray bang of green hair out of his face. It was hard work, boring work, tiring work – but it was work he was good at. He’d been practising it for millenia, after all – he’d like to think he would be.\n\nToday, the sun was beating down on them. The air was hot and dry – though the sweat made the gilded collar at the slave’s neck a little less uncomfortable, it was small consolation. Only the overseer’s whistle could give that. When it blew, the slave stood, stowed his scythe, and helped the others bring the corn stalks back to the carts.\n\nThe slaves kept their break in the shadow of their master’s statue. It towered over the field – gave them a little shade at certain points of the day, like a sun-dial. A constant yet temporary respite, given at the same time each day for the past 3491 years of the slave’s life, just like the break he received half way through the day.\n\nHe looked up to the statue, for a moment – to the elf who owned him – then to the base, built of different stone. A statue of a different, draconic master had once stood where he did – a reminder that the cycle-clock of the world had once been broken. But the dragons were but a memory, now, fallen and faded.\n\nSwing, step. Swing, step. Swing, step. The slave advanced, scythe of silver steel in hand, as the two slaves behind him picked up the maize he cut down, like clockwork. This time, though, something did give him pause – an extraordinary shadow. The slave looked up to see a mountain gliding across the sky – Tacenie, in all its glory. He wondered, for a moment, if the Slaver-Nobles would fall as their predecessors once did."
 taychendi_empire_events.501.a: "Then he bowed down, and returned to his work."

 taychendi_empire_events.502.t: "Risen Once More"
 taychendi_empire_events.502.da: "A hundred thousand people watched on the fields of Traerraden. Over the past few years, every inch of Tacenie had been investigated, probed, stuffed with every artificer gadget and magical implement the brightest minds of Taychend could think of. Now, those gathered – Vustarin artificer or Blue House mage, gnomish tinkerer or Ruinborn scholar, Dawn Elven techno-thaumaturgist or Cennayakuta warlock – all waited with baited breath.\n\nA hundred thousand people waited in the port of Orenkoraim, the Gathyanavaida behind them. Warlords, warriors, and of course the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself]. Great projections had been set up, so that they could watch the launch in real time. [Root.Monarch.GetName] took a deep breath – glanced at those beside [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim], the creme of Taychendi society – then gave the signal to an aide beside [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim].\n\nThe soil of the steppe shook – then a wave of heat, and magic, and smoke and wind. Then, for the first time since the Ruin, since the days of Arethon and Ducaniel, Tacenie rose once more.\n\nEveryone who had ever even known about the project burst into cheers, shouts. “Glory!” They cried, “Tacenie!” “Glory!” “Tacenie!”.\n\nThe [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], though, did not cheer – instead, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] stood still, thinking. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] had one last decision to make. Tacenie had risen – but it was not destined to rule the skies. Its not as if it could, after all – the world had the knowledge to raise it to the skies, but not to keep it there. No, Tacenie’s destiny was to fall, and with its destruction signal the decisive end of the Cycle of Glory. All that was left was for the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to decide where exactly that would happen."
 taychendi_empire_events.502.a: "“To Anbenncóst – the destruction of Anbennar will signal a new cycle of unity!”"

 taychendi_empire_events.503.t: "The Day of Ashen Skies"
 taychendi_empire_events.503.d: "A fisherman off the coast of Venail was the first to see it. Then the priests of the Adeanscour, then the priestesses of Minara. High Lorentish noble and Low Lorentish farmers were moved from their work by the sight of a mountain moving through the sky. Some knew what it was immediately, having studied their history well enough – but it was only when the mages of the Windtower saw Tacenie on approach that Cannor awoke to what was happening.\n\nThey awoke too late. By the time Tacenie arrived above Anbenncóst, the Imperial family had fled – but most simply stood, staring at the flying city above. Men, women, children, of every race, every background, left their homes to watch and marvel, from Wesdam to Varivar. Tacenie climbed higher and higher, until it breached the clouds themselves.\n\nThen, it stopped climbing – for a moment it stood as still as millions watching. Then the force of its ascent reversed entirely. Its fall was powered for but a moment – the last dregs of energy either drained, or turned to fueling the awaiting cataclysm – but it was enough. When Tacenie struck the earth, it was as if Aesadas had fallen once more.\n\nNot as powerful, of course – but that was small comfort to those within its reach. Anbenncost was utterly annihilated in an instant. Fifty miles outside the city, person and building were simply incinerated, turned to ash by roiling clouds of smoke and fire and debris. Two hundred miles, and they were simply flayed instead, or buried alive by their collapsing homes.\n\nThe destruction reached the shores of the Dameshead. Coastal cities were wiped away by apocalyptic floods, while meteors struck those inland like missiles. From Aelantir to Bulwar, this echo of Ruin trembled, the scream of souls blurring shadow and fire. The death toll reached ten million by the end of the day – then, the ash storms began. The Day of Ashen Skies had come again…"
 taychendi_empire_events.503.a: "…but it was not, as some might have predicted, the end of the world."

 taychendi_empire_events.504.t: "The Day of Ashen Skies"
 taychendi_empire_events.504.d: "A whaler off Feiten was the first to see it. Then the eunuchs of Kohai, then the cities of the Yanhe. Xiaken monk and Hobgoblin scout were moved from their routine by the sight of a mountain flying high above the misted hills. Few knew what it was, not at first. But some Harimari philosophers, having studied the High Temples for years, recognised the architecture – finally connected the dots.\n\nTacenie arrived to a Sramaya confused, out of the loop. People of every race and background left their homes to marvel at the city in the sky. Tacenie climbed higher and higher, until it breached the clouds themselves. The watchers gasped as a dragon of brass broke through Sramaya – left broken buildings in its wake, as it flew higher and higher. The dragon – the city’s protector, once a shadow, a murmur – roared, jets of flame scorching Tacenie’s back, claws rending rock and artifice. For some, for a moment, centuries of baseless suspicions were proved true.\n\nNone lived long enough to share that confirmation. The force of Tacenie’s ascent reversed entirely. Its fall was powered for but a moment – the last dregs of energy either drained, or turned to fueling the awaiting cataclysm – but it was enough. The brass dragon was pinned beneath it – she gave a last defiant roar before Tacenie struck the earth.\n\nIt was as if Aesadas had fallen once more. Not as powerful, of course – but that was small comfort to those within its reach. Sramaya was annihilated in an instant. Twenty miles outside the city, people and buildings were simply incinerated, turned to ash by roiling clouds of smoke and fire and debris. Fifty miles, and they were simply flayed instead, or buried alive by their collapsing homes. Cities across the gulf of Rahen were wiped away by apocalyptic floods, while meteors struck those from Sardiphadin to Bim Lau. The death toll reached thirty million by the end of the day – then, the ash storms began. The Day of Ashen Skies had come again…"
 taychendi_empire_events.504.a: "…but it was not, as some might have predicted, the end of the world."

 taychendi_empire_events.505.t: "Year One"
 taychendi_empire_events.505.d: "Aboard the flagship of a fleet in the western Divenhal, the great warlords of Taychend stood aboard a warded deck, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of Taychend at their head, watching. They had prepared for a feast – a celebration. [Root.Monarch.GetName] saw the explosion in the distance, as it consumed the lives of millions. The ash fell – the ward above shimmered – and those below stood and cheered. They cheered for their Empire, they cheered for their Emperor, they cheered for the turning of the Cycle.\n\nThe [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] turned back to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] warlords, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] lieutenants, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] family. “Nearly two millennia ago, a similar explosion once ended our world as we knew it. The ordered rule of the Slaver-Nobles gave way to the chaos of the post apocalypse – and the rule of the warlords, and the rule of glory.” [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] surveyed the crowd before [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] – saw those descended from the greatest heroes of this past cycle. “But all cycles are destined to end – and their rulers are destined to be overthrown!”\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] drew his sabre, held it aloft. “With this sword, this Empire succeeded where every warlord empire before it had failed. We brought you, warlords of Taychend, to heel, and then we led you all to untold riches, unrivalled glory! Our armies scoured Aelantir, the Lizardfolk, Insyaa. We proved time and time again that we were the equal of the Slaver-Nobles and the Empire of Aesadas!” [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] pointed his sword at the explosion behind him. “And with this final act, we have proven that we have surpassed them!”\n\n“Some of you will return to Aelantir, continue raising the magnificence of our cities, our works. Some of you will sail on, to conquer the wastes left in our wake! But as you build, and grow, and march, and spill the blood of the world, know that the Empire you are building will not fall like those of this cycle. Know that this Empire will soar for millennia! That we shall rise above Ducaniel and Arethon, above Ebenanth and Yodhan, Ultarlan and Olhokar, Erankar and Laskaris! On the first year of this new calendar, Taychend shall rise above, alone, the unconquerable masters of this new Cycle…”"
 taychendi_empire_events.505.a: "“...And there we shall rule – an Empire Vainglorious!”"

 taychendi_empire_events.506.t: "Second Thoughts"
 taychendi_empire_events.506.d: "The assembled warlords raised an eyebrow as the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] stalled. “I just…” the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] paused, choosing [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] words carefully. “I just want to know the exact reasons. For my speech, later.”\nA high ranking warlord raised his voice. “Well… it would mark the definitive end of the cycle of Glory. Show that we’ve surpassed those who came before… both in this cycle and the last. Destroying the last embers of the Precursor Empire.”\nThe [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] turned to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]. “While ruining swathes of our conquests in the process?”\nThe warlord shrugged. “So what? We have not been lenient before.”\n\nThe two stared each other down for a moment. The room grew tenser – then one of the Mudaliar cousins cut through it. “My family has shaken off most of Tacenie’s legacy… but it was once the home of our founder. Are we really an Empire that wipes away the legacy of those who came before? We have not gone hunting for the dragons as the Slaver-Nobles did, have we?”\n\n“And our journeys to Insyaa and Sarhal?” Another warlord called. “What of them?”\n“Fine, but have we copied everything from the Slaver Nobles?” The Mudaliar shot back. “I don’t think we spend most of our times on useless pursuits–”\nA Cennayakuta noble in the crowd drew his sabre. “Says you, scion of Tacenie! Why deny us our glory at this most pivotal hour?!”\n\nThe [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] stepped in, raised [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] arms – the crowd fell silent instantly. If [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] allowed Tacenie to fall, signal the new age through destruction and devastation, would [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] not be giving in to the worst impulses of this current cycle? And falling prey to the weaknesses of the old? Would it really be looking forwards, or looking back? Were they really ending the cycle… or just bringing its excesses to new heights?"
 taychendi_empire_events.506.a: "“Tacenie shall fall, no matter our compunctions. Anbenncóst will be our target.”"
 taychendi_empire_events.506.b: "“Tacenie shall fall, no matter our compunctions. Sramaya will be our target.”"
 taychendi_empire_events.506.c: "“Tacenie will not fall… not today.”"

 taychendi_empire_events.507.t: "Year One"
 taychendi_empire_events.507.d: "The room fell into chaos, shouting, scuffling. Sabres were drawn. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] cried “HEAR MY VOICE–!” and the warlords calmed for a moment, stepped back – but their swords were not sheathed. Wrathful faces stared back at [Root.Monarch.GetName].\n\n“For too long, our quest for glory has driven us insane! When you look at this wanton destruction, annihilation – does that look like an Empire about to turn a page into a new world, a new cycle?! Or does it feel like an Empire succumbing to its thirst for blood – for glory?! That desire, that hunger– its taken us to the ends of the world and the peaks of the past. But the changing of a cycle, it isn’t about being better than those who came before, it’s about being different!”\n\nThe tension lightened ever so slightly. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] pointed to the projection of Tacenie. “When Aesadas fell, it ended the cycle because it ended the world as it was! I know what you all think– Tacenie’s fall will herald our ultimate victory, be the point where our global domination is guaranteed! And maybe it will be! But if this is a cycle of glory, destroying the world for more glory will not end it, but perpetuate it! And the world will not be ordered, and the cycle ended, by our empire, but by its demise!”\n\nThe standoff broke – warlords sheathed their sabres, and [Root.Monarch.GetName] looked to Tacenie once more as they gave up. “If Ducaniel had made this decision, his cycle would have continued another ten-thousand years.” Then [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] turned to the warlords. “But we have proven ourselves wiser than him, and more glorious than him! So go! Go back to your cities, to your armies– go back and be proud of what we have accomplished! And when we build again, march again? Do it for something other than pride! Do it for order, not chaotic glory!”\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] called for a mage to shut the projection of Tacenie off – though [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] knew it would not disable the city itself. [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] descendants could very well fall prey to that which had built their empire. But if [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] hopes proved true, then this would truly be the first year of a new era, a new cycle…"

 taychend_tailatam_system_reform_desc: "The Tailatam System originated as a method of governance instituted by Tailatam Sangamar in the latter stages of the Gophiran Empire. In order to secure his hold over the Kalavend, he summoned all warlords within his territory to personally kneel before him, separating loyal and disloyal subjects.\n\nNow institutionalised, the modern Tailatam System forces all new warlords of a certain stature to submit to the Emperor in person, on pain of death – seeing the grandeur of the capital and Imperial Power, any potentially treacherous ambitions can be seen off."
 taychend_mudaliar_system_reform: "The Mudaliar System"
 taychend_mudaliar_system_reform_desc: "The Mudaliar System originated in the practices of the classical Mudaliar Empire’s rulers. Rather than interfering with the warlords, meddling in their affairs and attempting to cut one down to size, they took a hands-off approach to their subjects, allowing the natural jealousies and ambitions of the warlords’ peers to deal with troublesome upstarts.\n\nNow institutionalised, the Mudaliar System provides a framework in which conflicts between warlords can be both cultivated and controlled, allowing them to simultaneously accumulate power while ensuring their rivals have a way to keep them in check."

 artifice_invention_taychend_demon_powered_flame_rigs_desc: "Successful expeditions into the infernal planes – “Cerachmanu” to the Taychendi – has led to the capture of many infernal creatures capable of spellcasting. By entrapping one of these creatures within a war-rig, and then enticing it to cast spells through conditioning, powerful flame-throwing, manoeuvrable units can be deployed."
 artifice_invention_taychend_prism_cored_war_machines: "Prism-Cored War Machines"
 artifice_invention_taychend_prism_cored_war_machines_desc: "Prismatic damestear is a form of damestear found chiefly in Amadia, infused with wild magic. Artifice powered by prismatic damestear is chaotic but powerful, susceptible to the same periodic shifts in both safety and magical potency that normal wild magic is. Nonetheless, the use of expendable slave operators in wielding or controlling Prism-Cored War Machines can significantly cut down on potential costs."
 artifice_invention_taychend_effelai_growth_stimulants: "Effelai Growth Stimulants"
 artifice_invention_taychend_effelai_growth_stimulants_desc: "The Effelai was home to many twisted, unnatural monsters, great and powerful, as if they were taken straight from a child’s nightmares. Having slain the living jungle, it is believed that these monsters – and the massive plants they fed on – were not entirely artificial. Through a variety of time-consuming methods, we have managed to isolate stimulants we believe play a role in muscle and plant growth – by introducing these to crops and livestock, we can supercharge our agricultural production."
 artifice_invention_taychend_imitation_seedthralls: "Imitation-Seethralls"
 artifice_invention_taychend_imitation_seedthralls_desc: "The Effelai was able to seize the bodies of the Effelai’s inhabitants, turning them into seemingly undead “Seedthralls” and puppeteering them through various means. Though we cannot replicate the Effelai’s exact methods of creating these thralls, we can use the contained remnants of the singing jungle to create a more disposable form of Seedthrall – by injecting disposable slaves with rapidly acting growth stimulants also sourced from the jungle, we can deploy these unstoppable (and quickly expiring) shock troops en masse, clearing the way for our regular forces."
 artifice_invention_taychend_artifice_augmented_kotakompu: "Artifice-Augmented Kotakompu"
 artifice_invention_taychend_artifice_augmented_kotakompu_desc: "Kotakompu – hound-sized, sickle-toothed rats common to Taychend – have extremely durable bodies, which are far more receptive to bio-artifice augmentation than those of elves or men. Grafted steel plates, bionic limbs, spell-casting eyes… there seems to be no limit to what the Kotakompu can accept."
 artifice_invention_taychend_relic_lord_prototype_power_armour: "Relic-Lord Prototype Power Armour"
 artifice_invention_taychend_relic_lord_prototype_power_armour_desc: "Since the Warlord-Emperor Yodhan’s day, warriors across Taychend have sought to replicate both his might and style of fighting. In emulation of the Armour of Yodhan, the Emperor’s relic, the Yodhanpir wore heavy, hulking armour – but it could not give them his strength or durability. Artificery, however, can solve that problem. By cladding an damestear-powered exo-skeleton in salvaged plates of Precursor steel, we can deploy true dreadnoughts on the battlefield, each warrior a relic-lord."

The proliferation of the Imperial Cult is now an important part of reinforcing the Emperor’s authority across the Empire.\n\nWhile Taychendi religion is not a proselytising one per se, forcing new subjects to give sacrifices to the Imperial Cult is an important mark of its “conversion,” and the Cult has become a key player in expanding Taychendi religious practices to new lands."

While most know her to obviously be a Vampire, Mihaela-Veliara’s administration maintains the fiction that she is, in fact, a Great Relic-Lord, whose blatantly vampiric powers had been granted by powerful blood-magic relics.\n\nIn order to make nice with outside powers, Mihaela also exports significant quantities of relics – a fact that has convinced many outside regimes to publicly accept that fiction rather than risk their supply. Notably, Mihaela has not actually broken the Masquerade – she has been careful to ensure that her activities do not threaten Cannorian vampire society, despite their hostility to her."
