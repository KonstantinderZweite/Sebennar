Z87_Gladeway_development_desc:0 "The gladeways have always been a place of little development the forest hostile to many of our people. The dimensions between the plane of the fey and ours have always been fickle, allowing for traveling to the other roots of the gladeway at a cost. The only hope for us to survive is to secure and develop these lands. We should start from the exterior as these points are easier for our contacts in the archfey to assist in developing as these are closer to the end of the fey residence this will likely cost us many resources."
