The dimensions between the plane of the fey and ours have always been fickle, allowing for traveling to the other roots of the gladeway at a cost. The only hope for us to survive is to secure and develop these lands. We should start from the exterior as these points are easier for our contacts in the archfey to assist in developing as these are closer to the end of the fey residence this will likely cost us many resources."

Unfortunately, there was a little bit of an unforeseen circumstance involving his majesty and his little habit."
Z87_great_haze_title:0 "A Great Haze"
Z87_great_haze_desc:0 "A vision appeared during our great emperors haze a shadow of a beast emerging from the ground. He spoke of the ground trembling from the power of the great monster long forgotten by the embrace of the world. One part of his vision stuck out more than the others the sight of many dead burned by a flame so hot and bright."

Servitude through slavery and death."
Z87_goblin_development_title:0 "Goblin Age"

Z87_sacrafice_title:0 "A Price of Power"
Z87_sacrafice_desc:0 "A death of a few is a sad fate.The death of thousands would be a heartbreaking affair. That is the perspective of a moral person. Muhi is not this noble person. The death of thousands for a chance of improving his magic is a fate that he is willing to serve. There is no point in trying to protect an empire without the proper power at place. Outside factors are key in changing the world there is a peaceful way to fight these outside factors but peace was never one of Muhi's strong suits. May our rituals serve the empire. "

May our pacts with the fey help protect us from the evils outside our woods."

Without the help of the fey muhi may have been lost in his studies for decades to come."
Z87_to_another_forest_title:0 "Into The Outer Reach"

Who will die to fullfill these paths. A dragonic figure appears oftentimes to Muhi. A haze appears over this figure a distant hue of red. A heat felt through the haze of Muhis vision. Muhi was never the same after these visions. All he wanted was to find the truth no matter the cost to himself or his people. His obession led to a quest of forests of the fey. Forest unexplored by his people. What will become of his country will be determined in these forests. Will death be the fate of his vision or will these visions instead provide death to those that oppose him. Time will only flow forward and his fate and the fate of his people will be decided on a fateful adventure."
Z87_spy_title:0 "Armored Treasury	"
Z87_spy_desc:0 "Etched into the walls of a cave near the dragon's site is a pile of mystical artifacts. These artifacts are surrounded by a blue hue. Our researchers have found that after throwing in a prisoner this blue hue cooks our test subject to death. Thankfully our leader moved closer to observe this and the hue stopped.

Z87_armored_snipers_title:0 "Armored Snipers"
Z87_armored_snipers_desc:0 "Our military is the strongest in the world. This is proof of our blessed future and past. We have developed a new pact with a powerful fey. As our military grows we have developed a sense of power that no other army goblin, human, or other has known. As the fey demand more of us, we grow in turn. The cost of this trade may be upsetting our people, but we have shown our strength before to those who have disagreed with our will so none will defy us. "
Z87_capitulated_populace_title:0 "Capitulated Populace"
Z87_capitulated_populace_desc:0 "The most powerful factions in our government hated the change we have made. It is time to educate these people to see our way. These people will never be satisfied unless we force them to be satisfied. Whatever the cost we must achieve our goal."

Z87_dragonslayer_room_title:0 "Dragonslayer Trophy Collection"

The goblin was an inbred goblin with nothing but one eye too big and a sword much too big for the goblin to wield. At least that is what the king had thought. "

 flavor_akluztajo.7.t:0 "Sleeping Beast"

A trip to find a dragon that is long thought to be dead. Lost in the forest was the likely outcome. Muhi could not be denied whatever came of this would decide the fate of our world. Months and what felt like years passed as they kept traveling scouring every dirt pile until eventually they found what looked like a cave. Fear crept through the whole entourage many remembering the previous fate of those that came to a cave under Muhis guidance. Muhi walked forward. His eyes a haze of red a read none of his people have ever seen. Muhis entourage were paralyzed with fear. Only Muhi moved inch by inch until he saw on beast sleeping in the cave. The beast looked strong on the outside but Muhi felt that the dragon was weakend. By what only the dragon and whoever did damage to the beast knew. The dragon opened its eyes and peered at Muhi. A deep snare of a voice came out of the dragon weakness creeping from the dragons vocal cords "A fate destined to fall on me, I am not strong enough to fight a mage as powerful as you in my current state." Muhi knew he had two choices to partner with this beast and betray his peoples past to empower his country and himself. Or he could choose to end the life of a beast and use the scales for his own men."
