The dimensions between the plane of the fey and ours have always been fickle, allowing for traveling to the other roots of the gladeway at a cost. The only hope for us to survive is to secure and develop these lands. We should start from the exterior as these points are easier for our contacts in the archfey to assist in developing as these are closer to the end of the fey residence this will likely cost us many resources."

Z87_sacrafice_title:0 "A Price of Power"
Z87_sacrafice_desc:0 "A death of a few is a sad fate.The death of thousands would be a heartbreaking affair. That is the perspective of a moral person. Muhi is not this noble person. The death of thousands for a chance of improving his magic is a fate that he is willing to serve. There is no point in trying to protect an empire without the proper power at place.

Who will die to fullfill these paths. A dragonic figure appears oftentimes to Muhi. A haze appears over this figure a distant hue of red. A heat felt through the haze of Muhis vision. Muhi was never the same after these visions. All he wanted was to find the truth no matter the cost to himself or his people. His obession led to a quest of forests of the fey. Forest unexplored by his people. What will become of his country will be determined in these forests. Will death be the fate of his vision or will these visions instead provide death to those that oppose him. Time will only flow forward and his fate and the fate of his people will be decided on a fateful adventure."

 flavor_Akluztajo.2.t:0 "The Right To Rule "
 flavor_Akluztajo.2.d:0 "One goblin has come from one of the most powerful clans to visit the palace. This was at least what our ruler had believed. This goblin named Muhi Dragob came from the flameways and he had more plans than just visiting our ruler. When Muhi came to our king his majesty felt nothing but despair. The goblin was an inbred goblin with nothing but one eye too big and a sword much too big for the goblin to wield. At least that is what the king had thought. "
 flavor_Akluztajo.2.b:0 "Why is there a sword probing out of our king's chest? "
 flavor_Akluztajo.3.t:0 "Pacification or Starvation"

 flavor_Akluztajo.6.t:0 "Ancient Relics Study"
 flavor_Akluztajo.6.d:0 "Muhi is no brilliant man but the relics were soaked in what felt like unlimited knowledge. He a fool felt himself grow smarter and smarter. His inbred nature taking second stage to the effects of relics that seemed to make him smarter by just standing near the ancient objects. Perhaps with this new found aid our king could govern and lead our great goblin nation a little better "
 flavor_Akluztajo.6.a:0 "Surely nothing bad could come from this"
 flavor_Akluztajo.7.t:0 "Sleeping Beast"
 flavor_Akluztajo.7.d:0 "Goblins,elves, and other lesser classes have followed Muhi into the great unknown of the fey relam. Madness this was the thinking of many on this trip. A trip to find a dragon that is long thought to be dead. Lost in the forest was the likely outcome. Muhi could not be denied whatever came of this would decide the fate of our world. Months and what felt like years passed as they kept traveling scouring every dirt pile until eventually they found what looked like a cave. Fear crept through the whole entourage many remembering the previous fate of those that came to a cave under Muhis guidance. Muhi walked forward. His eyes a haze of red a read none of his people have ever seen. Muhis entourage were paralyzed with fear. Only Muhi moved inch by inch until he saw on beast sleeping in the cave. The beast looked strong on the outside but Muhi felt that the dragon was weakend. By what only the dragon and whoever did damage to the beast knew. The dragon opened its eyes and peered at Muhi. A deep snare of a voice came out of the dragon weakness creeping from the dragons vocal cords "A fate destined to fall on me, I am not strong enough to fight a mage as powerful as you in my current state." Muhi knew he had two choices to partner with this beast and betray his peoples past to empower his country and himself. Or he could choose to end the life of a beast and use the scales for his own men."
