Z87_Gladeway_development_title:0 "Glade Enrichment"
Z87_Gladeway_development_desc:0 "The gladeways have always been a place of little development the forest hostile to many of our people. The dimensions between the plane of the fey and ours have always been fickle, allowing for traveling to the other roots of the gladeway at a cost. The only hope for us to survive is to secure and develop these lands. We should start from the exterior as these points are easier for our contacts in the archfey to assist in developing as these are closer to the end of the fey residence this will likely cost us many resources."

Z87_sacrafice_title:0 "A Price of Power"
Z87_sacrafice_desc:0 "A death of a few is a sad fate.The death of thousands would be a heartbreaking affair. That is the perspective of a moral person. Muhi is not this noble person. The death of thousands for a chance of improving his magic is a fate that he is willing to serve. There is no point in trying to protect an empire without the proper power at place. Outside factors are key in changing the world there is a peaceful way to fight these outside factors but peace was never one of Muhi's strong suits. May our rituals serve the empire. "

The goblin was an inbred goblin with nothing but one eye too big and a sword much too big for the goblin to wield. At least that is what the king had thought. "
