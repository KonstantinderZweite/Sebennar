 ynn_barges.1.t:0 "The Final Journey"
 ynn_barges.1.d1:0 "For years, $PREVIOUS_MONARCH$ has ruled our nation. For good or ill, they have led our people towards tomorrow. Today, however, their journey of leadership has ended, and their journey toward the afterlife, their journey along the sacred Ynn, begins. If this journey is to be successful, however, we must ensure proper transportation, so as to keep our ruler untainted from any impure floating in the River."
 ynn_barges.1.d2:0 "A previous [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has died. For good or ill, they have led our people towards tomorrow, and continued leading as head of their family once their term ended. Today, however, their journey of leadership has ended, and their journey toward the afterlife, their journey along the sacred Ynn, begins. If this journey is to be successful, however, we must ensure proper transportation, so as to keep our ruler untainted from any impure floating in the River."

 ynn_barges.2.d2:0 "The barge of our dead monarch $PREVIOUS_MONARCH$ has arrived at our Great Ynnic Dam of [Root.GetName]. The inhabitants observe with the due reverence as the barge floats onward, nearing the dam's gates."

 ynn_barges.2.b:0 "Charge the toll"
 ynn_barges.2.c:0 "Turn them back"
 ynn_barges.2.e:0 "Let our monarch through"
 
 ynn_barges.3.t:0 "[From.Owner.GetName] Demands a Toll"
 ynn_barges.3.d:0 "The [From.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] of [From.Owner.GetName], holder of the Great Ynnic Dam of [From.GetName], demands a toll from our nation if our monarch is to pass. Though many see this as little more than extortion, if we wish to properly deliver $PREVIOUS_MONARCH$ to the Divine Waterfall, we may just have to pay up. However, the option always remains to sink the barge, and have our monarch pass through with the commoners, if need be."
 ynn_barges.3.c:0 "We'll just open up the dam ourselves"
 ynn_barges.3.a:0 "Very well"
 ynn_barges.3.b:0 "Sink the barge"
 
 ynn_barges.4.t:0 "Payment Arrives"

 ynn_barges.5.t:0 "No Reply"
 ynn_barges.5.d:0 "Despite our very reasonable request to the new ruler of [From.GetName], they have not sent any funds. Instead, it appears that they have sunk their own barge, allowing their monarch to float with the rest of the dead through the Commoner's Gate."
 ynn_barges.5.a:0 "That settles that then"
 
 ynn_barges.6.t:0 "Our Barge Didn't Make It"
 ynn_barges.6.d:0 "With our barge stopped, we have been forced to a last resort: to let our monarch float along the River on their own. Though they run the risk of being tainted by the evil souls who may be floating in the River, at least this way they will make it to the afterlife, for better or worse."
 ynn_barges.6.a:0 "Hopefully they have better luck in the next world"
 
 ynn_barges.7.t:0 "[From.Owner.GetName] Prevents Passage"
 ynn_barges.7.d:0 "It seems that the [From.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] of [From.Owner.GetName] has stopped our barge from continuing its holy journey, leaving us with no choice but to sink the barge, and have our ruler run the risk of being tainted. There seems to be nothing we can do, and their ruler appears to have no intention of changing their mind."

 ynn_barges.9.a:0 "From yesterday to tomorrow"
 
 ynn_barges.10.t:0 "[From.GetName] Forces their Way Through"
 ynn_barges.10.d:0 "Despite our very reasonable request to the new ruler of [From.GetName], they have not sent any funds. Instead, it appears that they have used the ongoing conflict to send troops to seize our dam, and opened up its gate to their barge."
 ynn_barges.10.a:0 "They weren't supposed to do that!"
 
 ynn_barges.11.t:0 "Ynnic Barge Lands"
 ynn_barges.11.d1:0 "A vessel containing the coffin of an ancestor has arrived in [1031.GetName] today, plunging into the lake from the Great Waterfall above.

 ynn_barges.11.d2:0 "A vessel has arrived in [1031.GetName] today, plunging into its lake from the great waterfall above.

 ynn_barges.11.d3:0 "A vessel containing the coffin of a dead Ynnic monarch has arrived in [1031.GetName] today, plunging into its lake from the great waterfall above.

 #Ynn Events
 ynn_events.0.t:0 "Reurbanization"
 ynn_events.0.d:0 "After centuries of decay, warfare, and abandonment in favour of the countryside, the peace brought about by our nation has allowed the hub cities along the Ynn River to know prosperity once again, reaching levels of urban sprawl unseen since the times of the Ynnic Empire.\n\nWhere once laid ruins and decayed buildings getting scavenged for materials, are now blooming metropolises whose streets draw all from Cannorian fighters to Raheni merchants, and all along the Ynn people are thanking our nation for that."
 ynn_events.0.a:0 "May this be an age of even greater prosperity"
  
 ynn_events.1.t:0 "Clearing Out the Tromseloc Way"
 ynn_events.1.d:0 "A group of three riders bearing the banners of [Root.GetName] rode through the mist, the eerie silence of Tromseloc only broken by the squishes of their steeds' hooves on the old muddy path. Riding ahead to a ruined waypost of faint red and white paint, the captain gazed between the cracked walls, and saw the movement of antlers. "Be ready everyone, it looks like we've cornered a wendigo." The captain said to his companions, before dismounting and approaching the door.\n\nWith a kick, the old door was shattered, and the captain stepped inside sword in hand, turning to the right and raising his blade to meet the claws of the incoming wendigo."
 ynn_events.1.a:0 "If the way is clear? It's clear enough for an army to march through if they're careful."

 ynn_events.6.t:0 "Iosahar Drifts Away"
 ynn_events.6.d:0 "Our Iosahar in [iosahar_into_tributary_target.GetName] has been acting independently for quite some time now, acknowledging our Overlordship but not our authority. They've used their distance from our capital as an excuse to conveniently forget about our edicts, our missives, and - Ynn be merciful - our party invitations, hoping that we wouldn't notice their absence.\n\nIf we don't act soon, [iosahar_into_tributary_target.GetName] may declare full independence."
 ynn_events.6.a:0 "Remind them who rules."
 ynn_events.6.b:0 "We don't need their sword; their tribute is enough."

 ynn_events.7.t:0 "Overlord Infringes on Tradition"
 ynn_events.7.d1:0 "[From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] has declared the Iosahar system obsolete, undoing the work our predecessors have done to establish a land of equal lords. Clearly, [From.Monarch.GetName] is seeking to restore the excesses of power that led to the fall of the Ynnic Empire! Shall someone do something about this?"
 ynn_events.7.d2:0 "[From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] has turned [From.Monarch.GetHerHis] back on Ynn River Worship, converting to a new foreign religion. Clearly, [From.Monarch.GetName] has gone mad, and now this madness threatens to engulf the entire realm! Shall someone do something about this?"
 ynn_events.7.a:0 "We shall rise up!"
 ynn_events.7.b:0 "Back down."

 ynn_events.8.t:0 "The Great Iosahar Insurrection"
 ynn_events.8.d1:0 "Our Oathkeeping subjects have risen up in rebellion: led by [From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] of [From.GetName], they are clearly displeased with our choice to bring an end to the complacency and selfishness enabled by the Iosahar system. It is too late to back down now, all we have left to do is crush this rebellion, and our rule over the Ynn will be solidified forevermore."
 ynn_events.8.d2:0 "Our Oathkeeping subjects have risen up in rebellion: led by [From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] of [From.GetName], they are clearly displeased with our choice to bring the light of a new religion to this land. It is too late to back down now, all we have left to do is crush this rebellion, and our rule over the Ynn will be solidified forevermore."

 ynn_events.9.d1:0 "We have been bested in war and our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] now bends the knee before [From.GetName], pledging [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] sword and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] purse. We may bide our time and throw off their yoke one day, perhaps becoming Overlord ourselves. In the meantime…"
 ynn_events.9.d2:0 "We have been bested in war by one of the Antler Lords, and were forced to bend the knee. The City of Warriors and its institutions lay at the mercy of [From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] of [From.GetName], to whom we will pledge our swords and coins from now on."

 ynn_events.17.t:0 "The Dragon Kingdom"
 ynn_events.17.d:0 "The Rzentur share much of the customs and lifestyle of broader Ynnic culture, however ever since the overthrowing of Lord Trantan and the rise of the Drozma Tur faith, a wedge has been driven between the River-worshipping Sarda and Dolindhans and their Dragon-worshipping Rzentur cousins, who are once again decried as "barbaric" by the other two.\n\nEvents such as the rise of the Great Heathen Host, culminating in the slaying of Drozmagog at the hands of a Ynnic knight, have further driven this wedge, resulting in a sharp turn for the still-nascent tradition of Rzentan chivalry.\n\nWhile many knights are still employed by Rzentur rulers, individualism is no longer encouraged nor are heroic deeds emphasized, and the informal code of Overlord-Vassal relationship developed during the apex of Amacimst and Amaceped - the Two Castles Period - has been put to the wayside: the strongest Rzentur Lord rules with the title of Ladr - Duke - as a superior to his other vassals and the sole enforcer of the Dragon's will."
 ynn_events.17.a:0 "It is time to bury the antlers."
 ynn_events.17.b:0 "We will conquer the Ynnics using their laws."
 ynn_17_tooltip:0 "Every Rzentur §YIosahar§! subject becomes a normal §YVassal§!, gaining §R+20%§! Liberty Desire and losing §R10§! Trust.\nYou won't be able to make new §YIosahar§!."
 ynn_17_tooltip_really_good_idea:0 "§RYour Dolindhan vassals will not like this.§!"
 
 ynn_events.18.t:0 "Oath-bending"
 ynn_events.18.d1:0 "Our distant Overlord in [From.GetName] expected us to bend the knee, pledge our sword and pay taxes to a distant capital, but no longer!\n\nThrough some careful maneuvering, our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has managed to become free in all but name, only some sending some small, modest tribute to [From.GetName] occasionally."
 ynn_events.18.d2:0 "Our distant Overlord in [From.GetName] expected us to bend the knee, pledge our sword and pay taxes to a distant capital, but no longer!\n\nThrough some careful maneuvering, our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has managed to become free not just in fact but also in name, shedding the need maintain any pretence of vassalhood."
 ynn_events.18.a:0 "Outstanding move."
 
 ynn_events.22.t:0 "Visitors from Below"
 ynn_events.22.d:0 "Having for long stood on what we considered the edge of the world, the visitors who arrive to [1133.GetName] from below are usually limited to the occasional group of Boek climbers or Cheshoshi mercenaries, but today that changed: elves with pinkish skin and rounded ears - not unlike those of a knight - came visiting the holy city, bringing with them not just weapons and pouches, but also carriages pulled by small, antlerless horses.\n\nUpon questioning, we were surprised to learn that the majority of them were not elves at all, but a variety of species: what they had in common was that they all hailed from a farawy continent known as "Krarh Nor", the New Land.\n\nTheir carriages were filled with exotic crops, quality furniture, new and unconventional weapons, garments worthy of our ladies, even a tasty tree-shaped food item called mushroom. In exchange for their gifts, they simply asked to be let into the city, where they could witness the great dam of [1133.GetName], the sight of which had drawn them from afar."
 ynn_events.22.a:0 "Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to [1133.GetName]."
 ynn_events.22.b:0 "Guards! Turn these vagrants away."
 ynn_22_tooltip:0 "The visitors leave disappointed."
 
 ynn_events.24.t:0 "The Dragon Cult's Last Stand"
 ynn_events.24.d:0 "“The [Root.GetAdjective] are coming! Sound the alarm!" Erethra Dolenmach shouted, running from one bell tower to another.\n\nAs the bells rang through the streets of [drozma_last_stand_prov.GetName], hundreds, thousands of followers came out out of their homes. A mob armed with torches, axes, and whatever objects they could find, also bolstered by the few elite devouts to the Drozma Tur cause still remainining, now form a barrier several rows deep between the Dragon Prince and [Root.GetName]'s approaching [Root.KnightsWarriors]. Little can be said or done, as the [Root.KnightsWarriors] grimly advance, while the cultists wave their blades and draw their bows…"

 ynn_events.26.d1:0 "It is done. We have crushed the crazed mob of the Dragon Cult, and slashed our way through [drozma_last_stand_prov.GetName]'s streets, reaching the palace of deviancy where the Dragon Prince was being raised and revered. Our [Root.KnightsWarriors] disarmed the enchanted gates and entered the palace's garden, exchanging magical blows of fire and water with the Dragon Cult's last defenders. The fighting continued on the inside, as we fought room-by-room, until every Rzentur in the building lay dead.\n\nOnce the dust settled, our mages determined that the Dragon Prince was dead, and presented us with the body of a teenaged boy in noble clothes, none other than the creature itself having taken Rzentur form."
 ynn_events.26.d2:0 "It is done. We have crushed the crazed mob of the Dragon Cult, and slashed our way through [drozma_last_stand_prov.GetName]'s streets, reaching the palace of deviancy where the Dragon Prince was being raised and revered. The creature didn't wait for us any longer, and perched itself on the roof of the palace, growling at our [Root.KnightsWarriors] before spitting a cloud of flames at them, repelled by the water shields cast by our mages.\n\nOnce the dust settled, the dragon lay dead among the rubble of the now-ruined palace and countless corpses of our [Root.KnightsWarriors]. All the same, our surviving troops raise their blades to the sky and cheer, for few can say they have accomplished the deeds that transpired in [drozma_last_stand_prov.GetName] today."

We have crushed the crazed mob of the Dragon Cult, and slashed our way through [drozma_last_stand_prov.GetName]'s streets, reaching the palace of deviancy where the Dragon Prince was being raised and revered.

[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] stood at the front, wielding a spear and charging at the beast.\n\nOnce the dust settled, the dragon lay dead among the rubble of the now-ruined palace and countless corpses of our [Root.KnightsWarriors]. Alas, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] was among those who perished in the fight, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] death the ultimate sacrifice for the Dragon Cult's final defeat. [Root.Monarch.GetHerHisCap] remains were swiftly attended to by the best embalmers that were accompanying our army, and trusted carpenters were summoned to craft a royal coffin and barge. The streets of [drozma_last_stand_prov.GetName] are now filled with sorrow and celebration in equal measure as they await [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s funeral."

Our surviving troops raise their blades to the sky and cheer, to their victory today, and to the victory of their [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], who will be immortalized in Ynnic memory as the second coming of Artorean."

 ynn_events.106.t:0 "Devastating Floods"
 ynn_events.106.d1:0 "The province of [Root.GetName] has been brutally flooded by the Ynn River, and despite the local rescuers' valiant efforts, direct aid from our [Root.Owner.GovernmentName] is required in order to dispatch enough rescue teams to save [Root.GetName]'s population and fund their reconstruction."

The situation is especially dire in [Root.GetName], where emergency workers have been desperately reinforcing the embankments along the main stem of the Ynn, while the bravest Tide-Guards set out to rescue people and valuables from the crumbled buildings that were carried away.\n\nDespite these efforts, [Root.GetName]'s local forces are not enough, and they are requesting the [Root.Owner.GovernmentName]'s assistance. An assistance we cannot give, as our entire country is also battling the wrath the River."

 ynn_events.107.t:0 "Great Dam Requires Maintenance"
 ynn_events.107.d1:0 "Dams are powerful structures, built to endure the force of a running river - even then, they need regular controls and maintenance, and for a river as enormous as the Ynn these can become enormously costly. The Great Dam of [Root.GetName] is in need of such maintenance, as per the inspectors' report, and our [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] was called to help.\n\nWhile private citizens can raise enough resources and workforce to plug the leakages and avoid a disastrous collapse of the Dam, traditionally the Ynnic Empire and its successor states have been providing the bulk of the capital needed to keep the dams fully operational and ensure they retain their true monumental grandeur."
 ynn_events.107.d2:0 "The Great Dam of [Root.GetName], powerful as it may be, has received a considerable amount of damage whether from besieging armies or prolonged neglect.

 ynn_events.110.d:0 "A recently received supposed gesture of diplomacy from [ynn_joust_offender.GetName] turned out to be nothing more than a blatant insult. In accordance with the rules of chivalry, the words spoken can be justification for a duel of honour, traditionally in the form of a joust.\n\nWhile it may be foolhardy to risk life and limb over the gabble of some arrogant [ynn_joust_offender.Monarch.GetTitle] with a clear lack of etiquette, a lack of challenge on our part over this matter will be interpreted by many to mean the offending words were true!"

Is it time to purchase a pet?"
 ynn_events.306.a:0 "Why, I will take good care of this animal!"
 ynn_events.306.b:0 "Sadly I've never had a passion for small furry critters."

 ynn_events.307.t:0 "Whitetail Fox Sighted!"
 ynn_events.307.d:0 "“Fox! I've seen a fox!" has become a common shout across the province of [ynn_whitetail_prov.GetName], after a whitetail fox created its den near a local village much to the inhabitants' glee. Legend says that when the first elves wandered the land after the Ending Flood cleansed the world, everyone was uncertain on what to do until a fox approached people and taught them how to rebuild society.\n\nNow, new faces are joining the village in [ynn_whitetail_prov.GetName] and its inhabitants are working at a brisker pace than before, and who's to say whether this is the influence of the fox at work or a simple superstition acting in our favour?"
 ynn_events.307.a:0 "What does the fox say?"

 ynn_events.308.t:0 "Komenvecer"
 ynn_events.308.d:0 "Komenvecer or 'Stone Dinner' refers to a dinner or festivity where various seafoods are presented, featuring as the main course a large platter of Stone Fish which all diners are expected to take a piece from. Most typically held around the halfway point of the Stone Fish Stuir Balia, Komenvecer can also be organized when there's a big catch of fish or whenever the local lord feels a craving for it.\n\nAnd naturally, when it is someone as powerful as [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] organizing a Komenvecer for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] noble Iosahar, the seafood can be expected to be both abundant and delicious!"
 ynn_events.308.a:0 "Time to dig in!"
 ynn_events.308.b:0 "I need to excuse myself."

 ynn_events.309.t:0 "A Successful Komenvecer"
 ynn_events.309.d:0 "The Iosahar laugh amiably as they bid their farewells to [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] at the end of the Komenvecer, rising from the broad banquet table where only emptied plates remain. Some Iosahar are intoxicated - but not by the food, of course, rather by the wine. Everyone was impressed with the culinary skills of the chefs of [Root.GetName] and the finesse of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s hand-picked kitchen staff."
 ynn_events.309.a:0 "Let's do this again next year!"

 ynn_events.310.t:0 "A Fishy Komenvecer"
 ynn_events.310.d:0 "You could swear the Stone Fish tasted funny for a moment, but you did not want to concern the other table companions who seemed absorbed in the feast. Now, a few weeks have passed, and you have heard the news of many [Root.GetAdjective] Iosahar coming down with stomach pains and fevers. While nobody would accuse [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] as the responsible of that, many suspect the food intoxication had a certain degree of correlation with [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] recent feast."
 ynn_events.310.a:0 "Let's just hope nothing bad happens to [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]."

 ynn_events.311.t:0 "Rivalry Between Sky and Water"
 ynn_events.311.d:0 "An incessant barrage of rain and thunder has been striking the province of [ynn_thunderdome_prov.GetName] over the last few weeks, in what the locals swore to be no mere rainstorm. Our agents investigated and found it to be the truth: the rainfall and thunderbolts are in fact the vicious blows of two creatures, a Thunderbird and an Underwater Lynx, locked in a bitter fight to the death judging by the severity of their attacks.\n\nWe may tell [ynn_thunderdome_prov.GetName]'s inhabitants to stay sheltered in their homes for as long as it takes for one of the fighters to beat the other, however the damage brought by the ever-worsening weather may well prove disastrous by then. To bring a swifter end to this, we are aware of rituals that can placate zodiac creatures and restore the balance, however those who perform them will be at great risk, as they'll need to approach the very eye of the storm while the creatures trade blows."
 ynn_events.311.a:0 "Best to not interfere in supernatural fights."
 ynn_events.311.b:0 "Perform a ritual to placate the creatures! It's the only way to avert disaster!"
 ynn_events.311.c:0 "Ask the Veykodan druids for advice."
 ynn_events.311.d:0 "Summon the aid of Epednar shamans."

 ynn_events.312.t:0 "Taming a Wild Antler Horse"
 ynn_events.312.d:0 "Our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] seemed unusually late to return from [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] last hunting trip, but just as the courtesans began to worry, there [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] appears from the horizon, and on a new ride. An antler horse of a massive size - far more than your usual war steed - is trotting along the route that leads to [Root.Capital.GetName], carrying [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] on its rugged back.\n\nArriving to [Root.Capital.GetName]'s gates to a row of impressed guards and frightened peasants, the ruler deftly descends along the creature's side and bids it farewell for now, as the horse begins its walk towards a nearby grove; the gates and streets simply weren't large enough for it either way."
 ynn_events.312.a:0 "The favour of a wild antler horse is a great sign of prestige!"
 ynn_events.312.b:0 "The earth shall tremble, and so shall our enemies."

 
# ynn_events.6.t:0 "Rumours from the Nether World"
# ynn_events.6.d:0 "The Netherfolk are a mysterious people who live beneath the enormous cliffs to our south, conducting primitive semi-nomadic lives in a land which is known to us as Posveagal, the Nether World. Contacts with them are scarce, and often limited to the legends and deeds of our oldest forefathers or the recountings from the rare visitor who daringly climbed the Southern Cliffs.\n\nToday [1133.GetName] received one such visitor, an elf named Kalin'do who brought an unusual story: while he and his tribe were out hunting, they saw an enormous vessel approach their shores, and from the vessel descended people dressed like kings, wielding tools and weapons of a quality unmatched."

All villages along this path were eventually abandoned due to a resurgence in Wendigos and Veykodan raids.\n\nNow that we prepare to restore order and emerge from the Dark Ages, rebuilding the Tromseloc Way will open up a vital connection between Dolindha and Sarda. We will send parties to clear out ruined waystations before our engineers can repair them or build new ones from scratch, paths will need to be beaten again, and communities will need plenty of encouragement to move in; we will no doubt face stiff resistance from Veykodan tribes, or worse still, ambushes by Wendigos hiding among the trees and ruins, which is why our efforts must be carried out with the maximum alert."
