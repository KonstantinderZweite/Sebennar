  flavor_neratica.2.d:0 "Nerat is the Judge of the Dead and Warden of Hell. Our duty as his servants is to take action to destroy those who defile life itself, and unlike the corrupted leadership of the Necropolis our order did not forget that oath.\n\nThe ruinborn elves of this so-called Reaper's Coast worship an evil god of death they call 'Cheshosh', and those Cheshoshi built a powerful kingdom here, centered around a massive complex they call the Bone Citadel. It is a grim monument of death and heresy where their priests wield deathly magics and torture the souls of those who displease them. It is antithetical to everything Nerat stands for. It must be destroyed, lest they rip open the gates of the Fugue Plane and upset the very natural order.\n\nOur clerics and paladins shall march on the Citadel and let them know Nerat's righteous fury!"
  flavor_neratica.2.a:0 "Heretic fools. Nerat is with us!"

  flavor_neratica.3.t:0 "The Onyx War"
  flavor_neratica.3.d:0 "A gigantic army landed on our shores recently, with weapons of war we had never encountered before. The few elves that came back after the first attempts at contact reported that they were clad in black metal and left few survivors. Those evil invaders have now started marching on the Bone Citadel, the heart of our chiefdom, to destroy it and leave nothing in their wake!\n\nThe [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has called upon the vassal chiefs to honor their oaths of loyalty, but [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] authority has been called in question by our subjects as many believe those demons were sent by Cheshosh himself to deliver punishment upon [Root.Monarch.GetName] for the Bone Citadel's exactions.\n\nThey are of course mistaken; those invaders were clearly sent by Cheshosh to test us and reveal the weak and traitors among our ranks. The Bone Citadel shall stand for centuries to come once this is over, for what does not kill us makes us stronger!"
