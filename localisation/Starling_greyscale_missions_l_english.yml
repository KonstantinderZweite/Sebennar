 EF7_appropriate_industry_desc:0 "Our coffers are empty. Indeed, there was never really anything in them in the first place. While this wasn't an issue beforet the Dragonwake- it is when you're trying to rule over a country. Though perhaps not as necessary- and subsequently crueler- for our state to survive we must seize the Gnomish Captains of Industry and their mines, lest our state fall to bankruptcy."

Though many are celebrating the now-assured success of our people, many others question whether it was all the bloodshed was really necessary. Regardless, a chieftain has no time to quarrel with such pointless moral quandries, and we should prepare for a bold plan with the Trolls."
