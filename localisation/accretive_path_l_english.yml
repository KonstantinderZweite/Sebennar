 accretive_path_acts_of_hermitage_minor_hover_tt:0 "Acts of Hermitage\n--------------\nHermitage is a rather simple concept: one sets out into deserts and mountains and other isolated places, to separate one’s self from discord, to live in harmony with one’s surroundings, or to train one’s mind and body without worldly distractions. While harsh for many, such a path carries with it immense honor and reverence.\nYearly Legitimacy: §G+0.5§!\nYearly Yearly Republican Tradition: §G+0.15§!\nYearly Devotion: §G+0.5§!"
 accretive_path_acts_of_hermitage_major_unimproved_hover_tt:0 "§TActs of Hermitage§!\n--------------\nMonths flow like water, summers and winters passing upon the hermit like rain upon mountains. The body shivers, sweats, suffers, but strengthens nonetheless, and the mind grows as sharp as grassblades. The hermit is isolated, but not useless. They farm, build, study, contemplate as any would, but unburdened by diversion.\nYearly Legitimacy: §G+1§!\nYearly Yearly Republican Tradition: §G+0.3§!\nYearly Devotion: §G+1§!\n State Governing Cost §Y+15%§!"
 accretive_path_acts_of_hermitage_major_improved_hover_tt:0 "§TActs of Hermitage§!\n--------------\nYears pass like leaves in the wind, seasons coming and going; the hermit delights in them, but does not grasp for them to stay. The hermit is content, neither distracted nor burdened, as free as a bird. Their body is now perfected, stable as stone, energetic as water, with their mind as flexible as wood and yet harnessing the emotions of fire. And with their very nature as righteous as metal, they have achieved perfection in isolation.\nYearly Legitimacy: §G+1§!\nYearly Yearly Republican Tradition: §G+0.3§!\nYearly Devotion: §G+1§!"
 accretive_path_remembrance_festivals_minor_hover_tt:0 "Remembrance Festivals\n--------------\nIn many communities, festivals are the highest form of worship, whether it be a regular occurrence or on a certain day of the month or year. Icons and murals are plastered with faces both recent and ancient, all gone from this world. Such ceremonies bring a sense of ease and calm, not only to the locals, but also to the spirits around them.\nStability Cost Modifier: §G-7.5%§!"
 accretive_path_remembrance_festivals_major_unimproved_hover_tt:0 "§TRemembrance Festivals§!\n--------------\nPreparation starts ever earlier, more certain and skilled. Roles are performed like clockwork: painting, dancing, carving, all to a great and knowable design. Gentle laughter fills the air alongside quiet contemplation, yet one does not overpower the other. The celebration makes life more tolerable, burdens and pains easier to bear, though not without cost.\nStability Cost Modifier: §G-15%§!\nGlobal Tax Modifier: §R-10%§!"
 accretive_path_remembrance_festivals_major_improved_hover_tt:0 "§TRemembrance Festivals§!\n--------------\nCycles are determined by the festival, preparations beginning weeks or months in advance. Joy and grief ebb and flow, cycles to be embraced rather than extremes towards which to be drawn. Endless arrays of ceremony and tradition, centuries displayed through controlled creation, lanterns outshining the stars, ancestors and spirits honored and appeased.\nStability Cost Modifier: §G-15%§!"
 accretive_path_sponsor_travelling_libraries_minor_hover_tt:0 "Sponsor Travelling Libraries\n--------------\nWagons set out for the horizon, stocked on scrolls and books, tended to by philosophers and scholars. Few can read out there; as such the pages are read aloud, under azure or dusk skies. Knowledge is brought from the centers of empires and societies to the edges, rural villages and townships enlightened by lantern-light.\nGlobal Institution Spread: §G+10%§!"
 accretive_path_sponsor_travelling_libraries_major_unimproved_hover_tt:0 "§TSponsor Travelling Libraries§!\n--------------\nThe wagons continue unimpeded, stopped only along rivers and at markets. The darkness is illuminated, the mist parting from the minds they greet. They are hailed wherever they go, whether on tall mountain slopes or along winding forest paths or by harsh desert trails. Ignorance persists, however, and intellectuals are summoned from the capital; ever more lanterns are lit against the dark.\nGlobal Institution Spread: §G+20%§!\nAdvisor Pool: §Y-1§!"
 accretive_path_sponsor_travelling_libraries_major_improved_hover_tt:0 "§TSponsor Travelling Libraries§!\n--------------\nIllumination covers the land, illustrious and resplendent. Villagers read tomes, scrolls, and books, make notes for themselves, knowledge carrying itself further than the wagons ever could. Like the fireflies that surround the wagon come nightfall, the light of knowledge spreads further and faster now; no need for the lanterns, as unburdened as the rivers and wind.\nGlobal Institution Spread: §G+20%§!"
 accretive_path_meditation_through_labour_minor_hover_tt:0 "Meditation Through Labour\n--------------\nThe farmers set out at dawn, lazily trailing the path down to their patches of rice and vegetables, as the miners make for their ores and minerals. Both work hard through the day, the swing of a scythe and of a pickaxe creating a chorus, if only they could hear it.\nProduction Efficiency: §G+5%§!"
 accretive_path_meditation_through_labour_major_unimproved_hover_tt:0 "§TMeditation Through Labour§!\n--------------\nBoth are faster now, muscles learning the tasks, the mind free to wander. It ponders the world at first, and then beyond, aligning as trees to the wind. Such labour is intense, however - many need time to recover, rest and regrow.\nProduction Efficiency: §G+10%§!\nManpower Recovery Speed: §R-10%§!"
 accretive_path_meditation_through_labour_major_improved_hover_tt:0 "§TMeditation Through Labour§!\n--------------\nThey awake at once, swiftly moving to their labour, their hands and feet moving as swift as rain and as direct as rivers, deftly dealing with their goals for the day. Their mind handles a thousand tasks, failing in none, glorious in its struggle, harmonious in its strife.\nProduction Efficiency: §G+10%§!"
 accretive_path_fill_the_begging_bowls_minor_hover_tt:0 "Fill the Begging Bowls\n--------------\nBeggars are commonplace throughout the land, from mountains to seas. Kitchens are set up, food is prepared, fires are stoked, boiling, grilling, chopping. Bland rice and vegetables, some meat, poor but filling, enough to last the night. Alms are given, coins clinking into cups and bowl.\nImprove Relations Modifier: §G+10%§!"
 accretive_path_fill_the_begging_bowls_major_unimproved_hover_tt:0 "§TFill the Begging Bowls§!\n--------------\nThe fires grow, pots and pans and chopsticks both bought and brought from afar.

 accretive_path_fill_the_begging_bowls_major_improved_hover_tt:0 "§TFill the Begging Bowls§!\n--------------\nExpertly diced spices, masterfully cooked rice - perfection in the grill of the meats. Hunger is vanquished, as one would slay a lesser beast or root out bandits. Laughter is shared round campfires, as energetic as the flames they speak beside. Coin falls swiftly as the rain; new lives are watered.\nImprove Relations Modifier: §G+20%§!"
 relive_past_lives_minor_hover_tt:0 "Relive Past Lives\n--------------\nChi flows through everything, and as such, it flows from life to life. If one concentrates one can flow backwards through the river, see one’s past. The journey is hard; the rapids of chi make progress difficult and short-lasting. Kings, mages, philosophers; wisdom can be  gleaned from the great men and women of history.\nIdea Cost: §G-5%§!"
 relive_past_lives_major_unimproved_hover_tt:0 "§TRelive Past Lives§!\n--------------\nSwimming is easier now; push past the rocks and roots, fly through the waters to your goal. Experiences are gleaned, memories earned, lessons learned. How to sort the worms from the cheese?. Many lives are simply ordinary, farmers and miners and slaves, useless. More energy, time, and resources are needed to push past this blockage.\nIdea Cost: §G-10%§!\nAdvisor Cost: §Y+10%§!"
 relive_past_lives_major_improved_hover_tt:0 "§TRelive Past Lives§!\n--------------\nFlow up and down the river, sailing through lives. Righteous heroes and wretched villains, powerful kings and feeble beggars, those who lived long and those who barely got to live at all. No experience is useless, no deed, action, or event unworthy of study or impenetrable in detail. In mastery of every life, preparedness for any situation is guaranteed.\nIdea Cost: §G-10%§!"
 accretive_path_universal_martial_education_minor_hover_tt:0 "Universal Martial Education\n--------------\nAmong the most basic ways one can cultivate their personal Chi is through repetitive attentive action: the farmer who waters their crops for months on end, the painter who learns the inner nature of azures and ochres, and of course, the martial artist who practices their stances and forms. Through universally accessible trainers our peoples benefit from the tuning of their soul, while the state will benefit when it comes time for war.\nLand Morale: §G+5§!"
 accretive_path_universal_martial_education_major_unimproved_hover_tt:0 "§TUniversal Martial Education§!\n--------------\nThe body moves through the will of the soul; through intentionality there is meaning, and through meaning purpose. To move is to grow, to stop is to become like a stone, devoid of life, devoid of Chi. Thus it is in the best interest of all to keep moving, to not lie still and rot away. Through martial arts the people achieve this, attaining purpose and the strength of cultivated life.\nLand Morale: §G+10§!\nDiscipline: §R-5%§!"
 accretive_path_universal_martial_education_major_improved_hover_tt:0 "§TUniversal Martial Education§!\n--------------\nRepetition. The body flows as water adjusting to the land; to the world around it. The punch begets footwork. Form follows form. The martial artist becomes akin to a watershed, their body a system. Through each strike flows their cultivated Chi. Through each strike - the fluidity of water. Through repetition, the peoples of our land imbue this creed.\nLand Morale: §G+10§!"
 accretive_path_leadership_of_hero_monks_minor_hover_tt:0 "Leadership of Hero-Monks\n--------------\nOur troops and generals are like flowers in a garden. They grow wildly and wickedly without a gardener, but with guidance from our Monks, they will grow straight and strong.\nLand Leader Shock: §G+1§!"
 accretive_path_leadership_of_hero_monks_major_unimproved_hover_tt:0 "§TLeadership of Hero-Monks§!\n--------------\nThe Monk bends and stoops in the bramble patch. She strips the soldier of the green shoots of naivety, and soon blooms the orchid.\nLand Leader Shock: §G+2§!\nGeneral Cost: §R+33%§!"
 accretive_path_leadership_of_hero_monks_major_improved_hover_tt:0 "§TLeadership of Hero-Monks§!\n--------------\nEach petalled head turns to the sun;seeking its fellows, it reaches for the sustenance. As the Monk tended the garden, now the garden tends the Monk.\nLand Leader Shock: §G+2§!"
 accretive_path_hire_sellsword_monks_minor_hover_tt:0 "Hire Sellsword Monks\n--------------\nOnce fully developed, a flower will bloom, stretching high and tall to the sun. The same goes for Monks, who offer their services not to enrich themselves for the gold, but for the experience that comes with such a dangerous profession. These are important stepping stones towards their future growth.\nMercenary Maintenance Modifier: §G-10%§!"
 accretive_path_hire_sellsword_monks_major_unimproved_hover_tt:0 "§THire Sellsword Monks§!\n--------------\nAlas, too many monks in a regiment will lead to squabbling, like a pot sharing two flowers. There is only so much room before the two roots start to fight for the riches of the soil. We must cultivate our monks as we cultivate our lands, before any dire issues arise.\nMercenary Maintenance Modifier: §G-20%§!\nMercenary Discipline: §R-5%§!"
 accretive_path_hire_sellsword_monks_major_improved_hover_tt:0 "§THire Sellsword Monks§!\n--------------\nAs time progresses, two flowers that share a pot either both succeed or both meet their end. Just as we managed to cultivate our state and land, so have we cultivated our Sellswords. Battles and wars have forged of our fractious monks fierce brothers-in-arms. A blooming future awaits.\nMercenary Maintenance Modifier: §G-20%§!"
 accretive_path_liberation_of_the_mind_unimproved_hover_tt:0 "§TLiberation of the Mind§!\n--------------\nThe mind is one of the simplest and yet most complex things. Like a fishing pole, one fishes to feed oneself. But a fisherman too focused upon his task will soon be swallowed into the sea. An inexperienced fisherman either comes back home or he can feed himself and let the sea take over.\nCountry Administrative Power: §G+2§!\nCountry Diplomatic Power: §R-1§!\nCountry Military Power: §R-1§!"
 accretive_path_liberation_of_the_mind_major_improved_hover_tt:0 "§TLiberation of the Mind§!\n--------------\nOne who conquers the sea, conquers the mind. Know when to focus upon oneself and when upon the sea. Such a fisherman will always come home with a full net.\nCountry Administrative Power: §G+1§!"
 accretive_path_liberation_of_the_soul_unimproved_hover_tt:0 "§TLiberation of the Soul§!\n--------------\nThe soul, the source of oneself. Brimming with energy that our body and mind suffer to understand and our bodies suffer to exert. Liberating our soul will lead into new riches and paths. But without discipline, such liberation makes a mockery of our duties.\nCountry Diplomatic Power: §G+2§!\nCountry Administrative Power: §R-1§!\nCountry Military Power: §R-1§!"
 accretive_path_liberation_of_the_soul_major_improved_hover_tt:0 "§TLiberation of the Soul§!\n--------------\nThe true liberation of the soul lies in the harmony of the mind and body. Each yearns for its own substance, but cannot exist without the other. It is our duty to discipline ourselves and harmonise these two opposing forces, so that our spirits may be made free.\nCountry Diplomatic Power: §G+1§!"
 accretive_path_liberation_of_the_body_unimproved_hover_tt:0 "§TLiberation of the Body§!\n--------------\nThe body is the foundation of the self. It is the host of the mind and spirit, and cannot be simply left behind. Like a proper foundation, it requires nourishment; the strength of the soul and mind are built upon it. Where the foundation collapses, the house is not far behind.\nCountry Military Power: §G+2§!\nCountry Administrative Power: §R-1§!\nCountry Diplomatic Power: §R-1§!"
 accretive_path_liberation_of_the_body_major_improved_hover_tt:0 "§TLiberation of the Body§!\n--------------\nOnly once the whole temple is planned is the foundation built upon;  without planning, the Temple would never hold the Mind and Spirit. Too small a foundation and the Temple does not fit upon it. Too broad, and one wastes too many resources to be able to afford the Temple itself. Every temple has its own foundation;  as we study them, we learn about ourselves. Otherwise all will crumble sooner or later.\nCountry Military Power: §G+1§!"
 accretive_path_river_flows_in_you_minor_hover_tt:0 "Stream Flows in You\n--------------\nPeople are like rivers, often flowing from one place to the other: from home to work, as traders from one country to another, as warriors from one battlefield to the next. As a state, we have influence and power to direct this human flow  into a more prosperous pond.\nTrade Steering: §G+5%§!"
 accretive_path_river_flows_in_you_major_unimproved_hover_tt:0 "§TRiver Flows in You§!\n--------------\nJust as with rivers, if there is too much water, the banks will burst, overflowing and causing immense damage along its path.In such a time, the bountiful waters of the river will spill over borders, uncontrolled.\nTrade Steering: §G+10%§!\nGlobal Goods Produced: §R-10%§!"
 accretive_path_river_flows_in_you_major_improved_hover_tt:0 "§TYanhe Flows in You§!\n--------------\nOver time, even rivers born of calamity will settle down. A strong path is carved from the ground, worn of years of unruly and overflowing waters running its course. As such, it is no surprise that many monks look upon a river and its reflection, and take inspiration from it in the cultivation of their chi.\nTrade Steering: §G+10%§!"
 accretive_path_words_aflame_minor_hover_tt:0 "Words Aspark\n--------------\nThe cultivated body is nothing without a cultivated mind; the mind demands knowledge and chi alike. Through careful calculation and redirection of Chi, thoughts will flow with it and come to the mind as flashes, sparks, and embers.\nTechnology Cost: §G-2.5%§!"
 accretive_path_words_aflame_major_unimproved_hover_tt:0 "§TWords Aflame§!\n--------------\nThoughts can consume — and through that consumption breed obsession. The Gangim people harness this to great effect through a form of meditative practice performed within hot springs; they channel their inner Chi towards fanning that flame of obsession, the flame of single-minded purpose which fuels innovation and discovery.\nTechnology Cost: §G-5%§!\nPrestige Decay: §R-1%§!"
 accretive_path_words_aflame_major_improved_hover_tt:0 "§TWords Ablaze§!\n--------------\nA curious mind burns; words and thoughts flow through their being; the flame fuels ever greater heights of achievement. Most fires of this sort are rapidly reduced to cinders, but not here, where the flame is ever-supplied with fuel. The Chi of the self, the Chi of the hot spring waters, the Chi of the nature that pervades all, may flow into, and out of it. As above, so below.\nTechnology Cost: §G-5%§!"
 accretive_path_serenity_in_rock_and_stone_minor_hover_tt:0 "Serenity in These Walls\n--------------\nRock and Stone, castles and walls; each adorn the halls of Haless’ Wars. They form as naturally as banks along rivers and cliffs beside stormy seas. Naturally, generals see these as just one more facet of nature's gift; precious buildings that protect the riches and prosperity in their shadow.\nGlobal Garrison Size: §G+10%§!"
 accretive_path_serenity_in_rock_and_stone_major_unimproved_hover_tt:0 "§TSerenity in This Keep§!\n--------------\nAnd as we build them up, manning such walls comes at a price. Just as in nature, all things come at a cost. We are moving just earth and rock, but people and families, barracks and armories, smiths and their tools. Are we able to take on such a burden.\nGlobal Garrison Size: §G+20%§!\nFort Maintenance: §R+15%§!"
 accretive_path_serenity_in_rock_and_stone_major_improved_hover_tt:0 "§TSerenity in Rock and Stone§!\n--------------\nAnd over time, our dedication and mastery has cultivated our knowledge. Like a cliff, the waters of discipline  erode all outcrops over time. Only the necessary stone remains.\nGlobal Garrison Size: §G+20%§!"
 accretive_path_the_second_ascension_minor_hover_tt:0 "Minor Ascension\n--------------\nAmong so many things that nature and life gives us, the most sought after is simply more time: more time to explore, more time to enjoy, more time to cherish, more time to gather wisdom. Many monks go on a quest to develop their chi, to break through their limits, often taking inspiration from old animals and their spirits. After all, wisdom comes from experience and time.\nAverage Monarch Lifespan: §G+7.5§!"
 accretive_path_the_second_ascension_major_unimproved_hover_tt:0 "§TPath of the Ascension§!\n--------------\nBut unlike some animals, blessed with long lives, people are invisibly bound to a clock. Some are even able to feel this binding, and will tug against its tension, writhing and contorting in unseemly ways. Such movements are visible, unlike the threads of time and death.\nAverage Monarch Lifespan: §G+15§!\nDiplomatic Reputation: §R-1§!"
 accretive_path_the_second_ascension_major_improved_hover_tt:0 "§TThe Second Ascension§!\n--------------\nBut like the Monks, with care and cultivation, learning from the deeds and actions of those that came before,we can build a temple of knowledge. We can grow comfortable in our binding, slackening the string for just a few more hours before the clock ticks down. This is at least enough time to prepare the next of us, and leave the care of the Temple to the next as we move on.\nAverage Monarch Lifespan: §G+15§!"
 accretive_path_tea_ceremonies_minor_hover_tt:0 "Tea Formalities\n--------------\nIn the fields, the leaves are gathered, brought down into the village-houses, where they are boiled and prepared. Two kneel, one pouring into porcelain, both grasping their cups with two hands. They drink, tasting the flavor, before talking. The formality brings a sense of ease.\nGlobal Own Trade Power: §G+5%§!"
 accretive_path_tea_ceremonies_major_unimproved_hover_tt:0 "§TTea Ceremonies§!\n--------------\nThe tradition expands; many kettles boil throughout the village, experienced preparation of newer blends. A group sits down, the host passing the kettle around, doling out the brew. A guest graciously thanks him, bringing his cup to his lips. He spits out the tea; a yet-to-be acquired taste.\nGlobal Own Trade Power: §G+10%§!\nImprove Relations Modifier: §R-20%§!"
 accretive_path_tea_ceremonies_major_improved_hover_tt:0 "§TTea Rituals§!\n--------------\nGrand preparation, elaborate blends and flavors, techniques tinkered with for decades by masters of their craft. The town comes together, a festival of trade and commerce. Pairs and groups, friends and strangers, old and young; each drinks from the brew of prosperity, which flows near and far.\nGlobal Own Trade Power: §G+10%§!"
 accretive_path_teachings_of_balris_minor_hover_tt:0 "Teachings of Balris\n--------------\nThere is no land in all Haless that does not know the monasteries of Balrijin, the sons and daughters of the great dragon Balris dispensing their wisdom upon any who would hear. Such a path is dangerous, however, and as such only a few dozen make the journey. They cross over rolling fields and farmlands, to the northern mountains where, amidst the temples, they make themselves known.\nPrestige Decay: §G-0.5%§!"
 accretive_path_teachings_of_balris_major_unimproved_hover_tt:0 "§TTeachings of the Golden!\n--------------\nBanners flutter in the wind as hundreds make the trek, passing way-stations and inns built to aid them, to the place songs are sung of, the place whose majesty tapestries can only half display. Greed runs rampant, however. Many cannot resist the allure of wealth, climbing all the way simply to snatch stray scales, trinkets to be sold at lowland marketplaces.\nPrestige Decay: §G-1%§!\nInflation Reduction: §R+0.1§!"
 accretive_path_teachings_of_balris_major_improved_hover_tt:0 "§TTeachings of the Auric!\n--------------\nTemples and monasteries, gilded with knowledge, blessed with eternal flow of righteous philosophy. Every day, thousands flock up and down the steps, whether by sun or lantern-light, the shine of wise scales guiding them to wisdom and enlightenment. And among those gilded peaks, the scaled scions teach the ways of their righteous Dawn-Dragon, the Auric Lord Balris.\nPrestige Decay: §G-1%§!"
 accretive_path_sages_of_the_misty_mountains_minor_hover_tt:0 "Sages of the Haze and Highlands\n--------------\nMonks and sages trek up and down the highlands, eyes peering out to find their way, each step landing on haphazard rocks and precarious ledges. The trudging ascent takes hours, gritted teeth and pained muscles, as each initiate makes their way to the summit of the highlands. And yet, that so few can take this path is a blessing.\nHostile Attrition: §G+1§!"
 accretive_path_sages_of_the_misty_mountains_major_unimproved_hover_tt:0 "§TSages of the Fog and Hills§!\n--------------\nThe path is easier; eyes, legs, arms, hands, all moving in harmony, ascending as one. Training begins, speardeft sages patrol the moorlands, their fogshroud cloaks granting deft invisibility. But the path is a burden for so many.\nOwn Territory Dice Roll Bonus: §G+1§!\nLand Forcelimit Modifier: §R-10%§!"
 accretive_path_sages_of_the_misty_mountains_major_improved_hover_tt:0 "§TSages of the Misty Mountains§!\n--------------\nThe men and women weave up the mountains, dancing across peril, water flowing to the highest ground. In times of peace, sherpas guide the way, merchants and travellers shepherded under sagely protection. In times of war, eyes in the hills, spears in the mist, an enemy rightfully uneased.\nOwn Territory Dice Roll Bonus: §G+1§!"
