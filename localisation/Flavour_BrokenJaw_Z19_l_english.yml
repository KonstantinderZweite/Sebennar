 Z19_shamanic_knowledge_title:0 "Shamanic Knowledge"
 Z19_shamanic_knowledge_desc:0 "Where others foolishly place their trust in whatever flimsy modernity they come across, we revere the ancient and sacred craft of our Shaman caste. Our shamans are unique, their magic and talent for prognostication centuries in the brewing, and we would be fools to throw away this distinct advantage of the orcish people. With that said, the organised state sponsorship and patronage which the humans bestow on their mages is a model we seek to learn from. Let us build shamanic lodges, free our shamans from the whim of government by earmarking funds on a yearly basis, and encourage them to see their counterparts in other clans as colleagues, rather than rivals."

 Z19_founding_the_council_title:0 "Founding the Council"
 Z19_founding_the_council_desc:0 "From his earliest rule, Jayuk has always valued good counsel – he tends to self-deprecate to experts, eliciting their good advice by professing his ignorance, though after so long at the helm he has begun to enjoy an easy familiarity with many topics of state. His clear vision extends to the future, to the rulers that may live after his death. He sees the folly of trusting in the goodness of one soul, one bloodline. Thus he seeks to formalise the powers of a monarchical council, in the image of a clan council, who will be explicitly powered to advise and enjoin their lord."

 Z19_justice_victorious_title:0 "Justice Victorious"
 Z19_justice_victorious_desc:0 "The humans in their endless ambition deem any method just which achieves their ends. Brasûr agreed with them. Now Brasûr is dead, and we affirm that ancient orcish idiom – “the sharpness of the sword is in the wielding.” It matters not merely that we rule, but how. Where Brasûr sought to make a King of himself in the human manner, we will make a land of clan-chiefs, where the collective wisdom of the orcish people is preserved and transmitted to our children, uninterrupted by the selfish arrogance of an autocrat."

 Z19_end_of_the_traitor_title:0 "End of the Traitor"
 Z19_end_of_the_traitor_desc:0 "Jayuk, by his own admission, was neither strongest nor quickest of those who sought to lead orckind, but he saw clearly and remembered who he was – who we are. Brasûr the clever falls to Jayuk the wise, and this war we fight for the heart of the orcish people proceeds, as it always must, with a struggle. Leaders such as Brasûr, who place their cause not in the greater culture or faith but in themselves, lay an awful trap for their followers – their ideas die with them. Ours will not."

 Z19_bring_our_own_title:0 "Bring Our Own"
 Z19_bring_our_own_desc:0 "It is no coincidence that so many successive states have made their capital at Bal Vroren; it is a fulcrum of the region, well-situated to project influence over our entire domain. But the city we build here will not be some Brasûrite mongrel; it will stand for the vibrant and traditional consultative clan culture of our ancestors, centred not around a single palace but around multiple hearts of discussion and exchange, grand halls for the finest families of the realm. Amongst these will stand the troll-clan, the newest of our confederates – but by no means the last."

 Z19_zurtrins_dream_title:0 "Zurtrin's Dream"
 Z19_zurtrins_dream_desc:0 ""Zurtrin defines us by what we are not, as his life defined us by ending. We are not blindly ambitious – whether out of madness, as with the so-called Dookanson, or out of avarice, as with the traitor Brasûr. We are neither decadent humans nor mindless, famished ogres. We do not drown ourselves in nostalgia as elves do, nor do we leap upon each novelty like gnomes. Orcish strength is in the slow, steady deliberation of the clan, the respect for precedent and legal stricture, and the hammer blow we bring to bear – in time."\n\n Shaman Ukyav Crowfeeder, 'The Broken Jaw'"

 Z19_tear_them_apart_title:0 "Tear Them Apart"
 Z19_tear_them_apart_desc:0 "The human irredentists in Escann believe that to be an orc is to struggle mindlessly for power, deaf to any sense of honour. The traitor Brasûr seeks to prove them right. But not all of us have forgotten what it is to serve Dookan, to remember the holy integrity of the orcish people. Starved we will feed ourselves on vengeance; naked we will clothe ourselves in integrity. We will splinter the Maw and tread its bones into our soil - all the better to eke a crop from this frozen earth."

 Z19_our_new_friends_title:0 "Our New Friends"
 Z19_our_new_friends_desc:0 "Where Brasûr wasted his energy and efforts on the fickle approval of humans, we look to the sturdy folk of the eastern woodlands, the trolls from whom we have learned much of navigation and survival. Their close knit communities and ferocity accord much more with our traditional culture than the bickering stallholders of the Giant's Grave, and we have already begun to forge close ties of friendship and allegiance."

 Z19_mutual_cooperation_title:0 "Mutual Cooperation"
 Z19_mutual_cooperation_desc:0 "The trolls of our nation tell us of a homeland far to the north, but close to us in spirit. These trolls of Ðigoveða live in clans much like our own. They are lacking in understanding of the institutions underlying a civilised society like ours, but they do have ready access to mammoths. The beasts’ utility for our cavalry regiments is obvious, but with troll handlers, they may also prove perfect plow beasts for our inhospitable lands. If we deepen our diplomatic ties, surely each nation’s deficit could be exchanged for the other’s surplus."

 Z19_an_exchange_of_people_title:0 "An Exchange of People"
 Z19_an_exchange_of_people_desc:0 "As our relationship with the trolls deepens, certain Gray Orcs have been recognized as "Troll-Hearted"; spiritually close enough to trolls to allow their exploitation of the northern lands to be done in a way that does not offend the giants. We have offered up many such frontiersman to colonise the lands around Lake Ormrsær in the name of their chiefdom. At the same time, many trolls believe the capture by trolls and troll-hearts of Bal Vroren renders it a site of holy conquest against the giants’ ancient enemies, and wish to live in its proximity, working in our lands."

 Z19_the_frozen_union_title:0 "The Frozen Union"
 Z19_the_frozen_union_desc:0 "The shamans are unanimous. Jayuk has the heart of a troll king, and [Z89.Monarch.GetName] has the soul of an orcish hero. The troll clans will submit to Jayuk’s rule, and the two peoples will continue to hold true to their oaths to their forebears, while forging a new oath to one another: to stand together in a Frozen Union against the harsh winds of Gerudia, and the blades of a world that sees them as nothing more than ravening monsters."

 Z19_the_way_foward_title:0 "The Way Forward"
 Z19_the_way_foward_desc:0 "The vision of a Gray Orc polity at the eastern fringe of the Giant’s Grave was Brasûr’s dream, but it was not born of him. It is the dream Gray Orcs all once shared in common as we migrated from the Serpentspine, and it is a dream whose time is overdue. With that said, Jayuk is no Brasûr. He does not seek to create a decadent autocracy in the human model, where courtiers bow and scrape to their monarch. Instead, Jayuk envisions a leader empowered by their Council and approved by their community, just as clan chiefs have always traditionally relied on the approval of their clan elders. Such leaders – whom he dubs Warmasters – will lead our people into battle and represent us to our adversaries, benefiting from the expertise of clan leaders and legitimised by their support."

 Z19_expert_advice_title:0 "Expert Advice"
 Z19_expert_advice_desc:0 "Clarity of sight. Integrity beyond comfort. These are the virtues of our Lord Jayuk, who has deferred to none in his insistence upon honour. Such a lord is exacting – just as he insists on the upright morality of his coterie, so he looks ruthlessly within himself, and sees all that is wanting. His unpretentious air brings the learned and the wise from far afield, and for all his legendary severity, the honest are rewarded. He offers himself to his people, reforging himself again and again under their hammers, like the ancient alloys of the dwarves. Such a sacrifice resembles Dookan’s, and we do not miss the resemblance."

 Z19_what_they_know_title:0 "What They Know"
 Z19_what_they_know_desc:0 "The humans of our land lack proper respect for the righteous organisation of a clan, and yet not all of their methods of governance are without merit. We will not dismiss all human knowledge as worthless, as the false Dookanson would have us do, but neither will we exalt them as superior to our own, as the arch-traitor Brasûr would have us do. Perhaps the human governments could serve as grist for the mill of progress when we consider what the clan of the future will look like."

 Z19_a_place_for_trolls_title:0 "A Place for Trolls"
 Z19_a_place_for_trolls_desc:0 "As the trolls have begun to find their places within our realm and the relationships between orcs and trolls deepen, conversation naturally turns to religion. We find a great kinship between our two peoples: as the Gray Orcs have remained faithful to Dookan and sought to free him from his prison, so the trolls have stood watch for the titans in the north, preventing any incursion of the younger races into their lands. We must build temples where both orc and troll can worship, each in the manner befitting their ancient oath, and build the trust between the races – and the trolls will serve as useful enforcers to keep our human subjects in line with a minimum of bloodshed."

 Z19_bringing_our_friends_title:0 "Bringing Our Friends"
 Z19_bringing_our_friends_desc:0 "The eastern Alenic Reach is in righteous orc hands… or is it? The squabbling humans who populate the rich coastal area continue to refuse to accept their fated role in helping us to enact Dookan’s rescue, and constantly flout proper clan structure – they even marry people of the same village, an act of rank incest! We must replace their ruling caste with proper Gray Orc chiefs, and expand the role of our troll enforcers in maintaining righteous hierarchy."

 Z19_the_humans_place_title:0 "The Humans Place"
 Z19_the_humans_place_desc:0 "The pact is simple, fair, and binding. The human clans will be permitted to send representatives to the clan council to learn from us, as the trolls have, how a nation is properly to be run. They will not be given a vote at the council, and they will be charged tuition through their taxes until they are deemed properly educated. The orcs agree to respect the rights of the human minorities to stay in their lands, and the trolls, filled with holy joy to live in the shadow of broken Bal Vroren, will ensure that none but an oathbreaker  comes to harm when a reminder needs to be given to the Reachmen of their obligations, for what harm could a criminal Reachman possibly do to a righteous troll?"

 Z19_dealing_with_the_locals_title:0 "Dealing With the Locals"
 Z19_dealing_with_the_locals_desc:0 "Jayuk is not a lord given to boasting – if he crows of anything, it is of his keen sight, his willingness to see what is truly there. He sees the efficient tax collectors of the humans, the organisation with which they split and tend to these meagre lands. He sees the great systems of rotation which preserve the thin soil, the village summits which regulate and parcel out work, not unlike our clans. Bereft of an Escann upon which to endlessly feast, he sees the future of the Broken Jaw."

 Z19_the_cost_of_living_title:0 "The Cost of Living"
 Z19_the_cost_of_living_desc:0 "So far we have struggled to collect taxes from the recalcitrant and faithless humans, but the gold mine of Old Dwaroval presents an opportunity: we can mint coins of the realm to purchase needed supplies from the humans, allowing their local orcish landlords to demand payment in a much more streamlined form. No mortal ruler’s face will adorn the coins – only a simple chain with one link for every crown of its value – keeping Dookan’s long imprisonment in the daily thoughts of all righteous orcs."

 Z19_the_local_fauna_title:0 "The Local Fauna"
 Z19_the_local_fauna_desc:0 "Our new friends, the trolls, tell us of the techniques they use to manage the populations of mammoths in their land, taking only as many as they need in each year and hunting down the Gerudian sabrecats that would otherwise thin the herds. If we develop these eastern lands and clear more land for pastures, we can trigger an explosion in the wild mammoth population, netting us a fortune in ivory."

 Z19_grazing_lands_title:0 "Grazing Lands"
 Z19_grazing_lands_desc:0 ""The modern plowmammoth, a common sight across Grombari farmland today, is actually not so ancient a creature as its monstrous proportions may suggest. Agricultural records from shortly after the Gray Orc Wars of Unification suggest this breed is a result of hybrid vigor, produced by the intentional release of thousands of the Ormrsær subspecies of the population into the traditional grazing lands of the Logrian breed. While many southerners find the cheese sourced from these beasts too sour and salty, it has become a staple of Gerudian cuisine, as in the (frankly delicious) Logrian syrniki."\n\n -Culinary Traditions of The Far North, Castonath Press, 1727"

 Z19_mammoth_warfare_title:0 "Mammoth Warfare"
 Z19_mammoth_warfare_desc:0 "As our troll-hearted cavaliers grow closer with their mounts, a simple truth becomes clear: fortifications exist on the Gerudian tundra only because the mammoths allow them to. No one has ever given the mammoths a reason to object to the structures marring their ancestral landscape. Until now."

 flavour_brokenjaw.0.t:0 "Jayuk the Liberator"
 flavour_brokenjaw.0.d:0 "What is moral strength, but to turn one's back on the promise of power?\n\nRejecting the swivel-eyed heresy of Korgus, we went north, only to see the conniving autocrat Brasûr backstab his way to mastery over the Gray Orcs, murdering our old warchief Zurtrin outside of the bounds of honourable combat. Now he parades about as a human king, spitting on our most ancient traditions of clan consultation in favour of his unbridled ambition. In his arrogance, he looks upon our meagre lands and sees no real threat to his teetering grasp on that stolen throne – but we will have our retribution.\n\nYes, these lands are marginal, but grasping Zurtrin’s broken jaw as our battle-standard, we will bring vengeance down upon Brasûr and win back the traditional clan freedoms which all Gray Orcs once enjoyed. Our Warchief Jayuk is by his own admission no chessmaster, no torch-carrying hierophant. Instead he is something more precious – a clear-eyed orc dedicated to Dookan's freedom, and to the freedom of his people.\n\nGathering his advisors around him, Jayuk has pledged nothing less than the preservation of the Gray Orc way of life."
 flavour_brokenjaw.0.a:0 "We will avenge Zurtrin!"
 flavour_brokenjaw.1.t:0 "What we Are Owed"
 flavour_brokenjaw.1.d:0 "In the wake of Brasûr’s death, we must tread carefully; a purpose fulfilled spells a purpose lost. In our vengeful despair, we were united with our brothers in Doombringer, but hatred is a fragile basis for an alliance. Petty-minded, they see in Jayuk’s successes only a threat, and have already withdrawn their envoys from our warcamp. \n\nWe are confronted also with the thorny issue of Brasûr’s human pets, the cluster of cities on the Giant’s Grave which he brought under his dominion. Confirmed in their traditional civic rights by Brasûr’s writ, we could, in theory, send these cities our own overseers in place of Brasûr’s - but many at court feel this stinks of human intrigue, of the wheedling apparatus of human politics. They argue we should simply end Brasûr’s bizarre arrangement, that our orcish constitution should recognise the clan system alone, the traditional freedoms for which we fought this whole campaign in the first place. If the land truly is rich enough for the taking, we can always simply conquer it, and settle our own clans there instead."
 flavour_brokenjaw.1.a:0 "Let Brasûr’s chickens out of their coop. We can cook them later."
 flavour_brokenjaw.1.b:0 "It is a lot of land to give up..."
 flavour_brokenjaw.3.t:0 "A Dream Fulfilled"
 flavour_brokenjaw.3.d:0 "Larrik found Jayuk sitting cross-legged in the winter garden. Here the shamans grew what only bloomed with the snow; mostly fragrant herbs for cooking or for healing, though the sickly white-green berries of the snowshank thrived with abandon, their poison severe enough to warrant a small, lopsided warning sign staked by the patch.\n\n“You’re being morose again,” Larrik said, handing over a small aleskin. Jayuk huffed a laugh, not moving his gaze from the horizon. He gazed not towards the sea, but towards the hills in the east. “I am,” he said.\n\n“You’re thinking you’re no Brasûr,” Larrik said, settling next to his friend. He had known Jayuk a very long time - all their conscious lives. Larrik had been a gentle boy, a boy who immensely relieved his father when he expressed an interest in the shaman’s way. Jayuk had fought off his bullies, had walked with Larrik to the holy places as he learned to wield the shamanic gift, just to keep him safe. There was no more honourable boy. No more honourable man.\n\n“I am no Brasûr,” Jayuk said, flatly. He had none of Brasûr’s brilliance, none of his genius. He had struggled even to learn to read, Larrik remembered well - had grown so angry and so frustrated that he stormed out of tents, took swings at trees. Long into the campaign for Bal Vroren, Larrik had attended every council meeting, murmuring document summaries into Jayuk’s ear. Even now Jayuk issued his edicts verbally to the Council, where they would be written down for him.\n\nLarrik glanced at the great wooden hulk of the Moothallow, the grand new council hall which locals had already sourly dubbed ‘the Pie’. The builders were making good progress; Larrik realised with a start that they had been here long enough for the snowshank to bloom.\n\n“No Brasûr…” Larrik said, taking a swig from his own aleskin. “And yet we all followed you here. What does that say about us?”"
 flavour_brokenjaw.3.a:0 "Greatness lies not in our talents, but in our choices"
 flavour_brokenjaw.4.t:0 "A Closer Relationship"
 flavour_brokenjaw.4.d:0 "An envoy has arrived from the orcs of the south, who have shared so much of their culture with us, and amongst whom we have found the only non-trolls to possess troll hearts. They tell us of one last tenet of their feudal system, under which an overlord like their Warmaster promises to treat any threat to a brother-realm as a threat to his own, in exchange for a  portion of our tax income. They offer this closest of bonds to our clans, saying that the formation of such a union is the only possible outcome for two nations as close as ours."
 flavour_brokenjaw.4.a:0 "Jayuk has dealt with us fairly thus far. Let us take this last step for unity."
 flavour_brokenjaw.4.b:0 "I think we’re better off just staying friends."
 flavour_brokenjaw.5.t:0 "Dealing with the Traitors"
 flavour_brokenjaw.5.d:0 "We have brought the lands of Frozenmaw and Doombringer into the firm embrace of our great clan council, but there remain those who still dream of the return of independent great clans by those names. We will demand oaths of loyalty to the new order, and a recognition that Frozenmaw and Doombringer are merely two clans among many, with the same voice on the council as any other.\n\nFoolish patriots for lost causes may rise up in refusal of such oaths. Then let them rise, so that all traitors to the righteous order may fall at once, leaving none to utter such poisonous words ever again."
 flavour_brokenjaw.5.a:0 "The claims of Frozenmaw and Doombringer will end on the field of battle. Today."
 flavour_brokenjaw.6.t:0 "Just Friends?"
 flavour_brokenjaw.6.d:0 "BETRAYED AGAIN! As Dookan and Zurtrin were betrayed by Korgus, as all righteous orcs were betrayed by Brasûr, so now has Broken Jaw been betrayed by those trolls we thought to make equal within our realm. They think to keep their clans separate from ours, to squirrel away all the knowledge we have given them and deny this final, righteous integration of our realms."
 flavour_brokenjaw.6.a:0 "We will not allow this betrayal to stand! To war!"
 flavour_brokenjaw.6.b:0 "Enough. I grow weary of vengeance. Let the trolls keep their independence."
 flavour_brokenjaw.7.t:0 "The Grombari Council"
 flavour_brokenjaw.7.d:0 "Arakh nervously smooths her robes, the strange weight of the jewelled bronze tips on her tusks unsettling her a little, making her unsure how to hold her head. Here in Bal Vroren everybody seems so confident, so naturally a part of the sprawling bustle of this place. She feels like a bit of a bumpkin.\n\nThey lead her into a squat building of stone and wood which the locals have already begun calling the Pie – it is where the Council will meet, where she will meet. High, narrow windows cast an intermittent light over the space, and orcs of venerable age and majesty mill about, draped in fine wools, strangely exposed-looking without their clan-axes; but then again she must look the same. This place is for disputation, not warfare; no traditional challenges are to be fought here.\n\nIt takes her a few minutes to find someone she recognises, her neighbouring clan chief. He is an elderly man with a peaceable nature, and she has relied on him for much in this past year.\n\n"Kavuk!" she says, pushing her way past a small gaggle of councillors. He takes one look at her and barks a laugh.\n\n"Don't worry, nobody expects you to talk first time," he says. "Wouldn't want them to think you’re a potential Brasûr now." Arakh gives a nervous smile. Kavuk shepherds her over to a clump of greybeards to make some introductions, and she feels her heartbeat quiet just a little."
 flavour_brokenjaw.7.a:0 "A new generation of clan leaders make their debut."
 orcform.1.e:0 "Our nation will be ruled by the Grombari Council, as Jayuk wished."

#Government reform
 grombari_council_reform:0 "Grombari Council"
 grombari_council_reform_desc:0 "The council system envisaged by Jayuk represents a formal evolution of the processes of elite clan consultation which are traditional to the Gray Orcs. Esteemed local clan leaders from across Grombar – orcish and troll – form a body which in turn elects a Warmaster. This Warmaster has authority over Grombari foreign policy and military action, though they may be ousted by a two-thirds vote of the Council. A strong cultural emphasis on consensus means that the diktats of the Council have unusual sway compared to similar quasi-republican systems elsewhere."
