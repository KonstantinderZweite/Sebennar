 #Events
 ogre.1.t:0 "Reign of Ziltagh"
 ogre.1.d:0 "The great kingdom of the Fathide Ogres, Maghargma, had long fallen into decadence. The King resided within his palace, gorging himself of feasts gathered from Centaur tributes while his warlord vassals ruled their lands unapposed, paying little more than lip service to their liege. When the Centaurs attacked the kingdom suddenly and the king fell in battle, the mighty Ziltagh rose to the throne, leading our people to victory and reaffirming the power of Maghargma over the warlords. While they may still desire their freedom, while Ziltagh rules from his throne none dare to rise against him."
 ogre.1.a:0 "Long may Ziltagh reign!"
 ogre.2.t:0 "Why are you seeing this?"
 ogre.2.d:0 "Northern Fathide Ogres hate each other yo."
 ogre.2.a:0 "Word, I feel that."
 ogre.5.t:0 "The Place of the Clans"
 ogre.5.d:0 "The clans of Maghargma have long been a great boon and a terrible curse upon the land. On one hand, their close connections to the lands they rule over allow them to govern them with greater efficiency than we ever could from Maghargma. On the other hand, their loyalty is not guaranteed, as the last few centuries have shown. As we gather the greatest of the clans in the capital to announce their place in the new order of the Empire, we must come to decision as to whom the people should look to as their direct rulers."
 ogre.5.a:0 "We cannot trust them, the people shall look to us for guidance."
 ogre.5.b:0 "Now is the time for the clans to show their loyalty."
 ogre.6.t:0 "Owners of the Land"
 ogre.6.d:0 "As we ponder how to decide who should rule over the villages and rural areas of our Empire, we've come to two choices. Either we hold grand festivals of brawling and bloodsport to find the strongest within a village, granting the victor the right to the land, or we pass the villages to be ruled by prominent families in the area, effectively creating a caste of lower clans. While appointing strong warriors to rule would greatly improve the martial spirit of our people, utilizing local families would grant stability and wealth to the lands they rule over."
 ogre.6.a:0 "Only the strongest shall rule our people. Let the games begin!"
 ogre.6.b:0 "We should anoint lesser clans to ensure prosperity in the Empire."
 ogre.7.t:0 "Nature of our Warriors"
 ogre.7.d:0 "In an effort to project our status as a powerful and united Empire, many of our advisors have pushed for a reformation of our warbands. While the raging horde of hungry Ogres, eager to devour anything that stands in their way, may have been the prime weapon for ages, they claim that organizing the hordes under the strict guiding hands of powerful warlords would greatly improve the ability of our army, even if we must suffer in terms of how much manpower we can field."
 ogre.7.a:0 "The Hordes have served us well, and will continue to far into the future."
 ogre.7.b:0 "We must rally our forces into a disciplined force to project our might."
 ogre.8.t:0 "The Blackhand Missive"
 ogre.8.d:0 "We have received a rather poorly composed letter from the Ogre realm to the west. Though it took some time, we've realized that it is an ultimatum; they demand that we submit to their rule or, as they put it, earn an honored position at their feasting hall. The missive has inspired both anger and terror within our city, as the Ogres, while crude and ill-mannered, are quite powerful. They're expecting a response, and it would not be in our benefit to make them wait."
 ogre.8.a:0 "We have no choice but to kneel."
 ogre.8.b:0 "We shall never submit to those gluttons!"
 ogre.9.t:0 "The Human Response"
 ogre.9.d:0 "The humans of the Federation have sent their responses back, they have been gathered to present to the Menghurkha at his discretion."
 ogre.9.a:0 "Let us see."
 ogre.10.t:0 "Mining in Maghargma"
 ogre.10.d:0 "Our prospectors have successfully reopened the mines surrounding the capital, and have already discovered new veins to harvest from."
 ogre.10.a:0 "What have they brought from the depths of the earth?"
 ogre.11.t:0 "The Kelaktar of [Root.GetName]"
 ogre.11.d:0 "After years of hard work the fortifications of our capital are complete, the walls have been repaired and dozens of war halls have been constructed to house our warriors."
 ogre.11.a:0 "A true sign of our might."
 ogre.12.t:0 "Great Kelaktar"
 ogre.12.d:0 "One of our subjects has expanded their Kelaktar into a massive and bustling fortress city that many claim to rival Maghargma itself. While this is clearly a bold exaggeration the effect it has had on our prestige is clear. The greater factions frequently gather within the walls of the Great Kelaktar to meet behind closed doors and scheme, and it is clear that out position is now tenuous at best."
 ogre.12.a:0 "Worrisome."
 
 ogre.14.t:0 "Prepare for War"
 ogre.14.d:0 "We have raised our forces and readied our clansmen for war, now all that must be decided is how we plan to manage this war. We could either confront the residents of Amldihr in their homes, attacking their mountain with the full might and fury of our people to ensure peace and security within our swamp. On the other hand we can lure them out of their caves and tunnels to crash upon our walls and be claimed by our bogs."
 ogre.14.a:0 "We shall take the fight to them!"
 ogre.14.b:0 "They shall rot in our swamps!"

 maghargma_bolster_warband_desc:0 "Our warriors have become lazy and complacent, many have abandoned the warbands to gorge themselves on the fruits of other's labor. We must end this trend and force them back into our military if we wish to regain our former glory."
 maghargma_enforcing_rule_title:0 "Enforcing our Rule"
 maghargma_enforcing_rule_desc:0 "The power of our throne is still questioned by many of our subjects, who point towards the centuries of stagnation and neglect our forefathers enabled through their apathetic and hedonistic reigns as evidence of our illegitimate rule. We must bring these treasonous fiends to heel, and prove our might."
 maghargma_rein_the_north_title:0 "Rein in the North"
 maghargma_rein_the_north_desc:0 "As our realm sank deeper into decadence the furthest northern reaches of our Kingdom took the opportunity to break away from the crown. Far to the north are wild and traitorous clans, long time enemies of our people, and just south of them are the warlords that pay little more than lip service to their rightful liege. Through a great show of strength we can finally bring our errant subjects back into the fold."
 maghargma_the_rock_title:0 "Conquering the Rock"
 maghargma_the_rock_desc:0 "The domain of the Strongrock clan, Iltklerd, has long been the Kingdom's shield against the roaming centaurs. In the ancient past, many great battles were fought in their lands to defend our people, though with the start of the tributary system these conflicts slowly came to an end. The Strongrocks have slowly been pulling away from Maghargma's rule, confident that the strength of their walls would keep the hordes at bay, up until they were slaughtered by the treacherous centaurs and crawled back to their liege for protection.\n\nNow, as we pursue a grander future, we must bring their lands back under our sway, and ensure they shall never break away again."

 maghargma_break_the_spine_desc:0 "The Spinebreaker clan of Remlygenjrot is renowned as the cruelest and most brutal in all of Maghargma, the leaders of numerous rebellions against the first of our kings and feared throughout the Kingdom. They were among the first to denounce our throne, choosing to reign their lands with a bloody fist. Though crude and merciless, it would be to our great benefit to finally bring these monsters to kneel."
 maghargma_train_new_warriors_title:0 "Training new Warriors"

 maghargma_the_river_title:0 "Down the River"
 maghargma_the_river_desc:0 "Prosperous Kvakolba, home of the Stoneheart clan, has always been the most loyal of our subjects, guarding the passage to our capital and ferrying wealth to our walls. Nevertheless, they too have enjoyed far too many liberties in recent centuries, and they should be reminded that we are their liege, and not their friend."
 maghargma_riverstone_title:0 "Market of Riverstone"
 maghargma_riverstone_desc:0 "As the Kvakolba returns to its rightful position as the center of our Kingdom's trade network, a great market has been founded in the heart of the city as caravans stop behind the city's walls to rest and prepare themselves to enter the royal capital. We should support the growth of this bazaar, as it would only benefit us."
 maghargma_taking_the_chains_title:0 "Taking the Chains"
 maghargma_taking_the_chains_desc:0 "Safe from centaur hordes, northern warbands, and, annoyingly, royal taxmen, Achtejardon is the center of slavery within Maghargma, with countless auctions being held every day. The city is run by the wealthiest slavers, the Chainlord clan, who rule their lands from their opulent palace, using their most trusted servants to enforce their will. They view themselves above our throne. We will prove them wrong."
 maghargma_empower_slavers_title:0 "Empower the Slavers"
 maghargma_empower_slavers_desc:0 "Much as we are loathe to admit it, our people are notoriously lazy. Unless it benefits them directly or they have a whip to their backs, Ogres are very slow to undertake menial labor. With the slavers of Achtejardon under our thumb for the first time in centuries, we have a new source of cheap and "motivated" labor to work in our fields, mines, and workshops."
 maghargma_steel_wall_title:0 "The Valley of Steel"
 maghargma_steel_wall_desc:0 "Nestled within the cool embrace of a massive valley, Olkhajukh produces the vast majority of the Kingdom's weaponry. For centuries this was traded to the centaurs in return for tribute, however with the betrayal of those bastard horsemen we need all the quality steel we can get. The Steelgrinders, long safe within the confines of their rocky walls, must know the might of our throne."
 maghargma_ogrish_steel_title:0 "Ogrish Steel"
 maghargma_ogrish_steel_desc:0 "If we are to restore the glory of Maghargma and enact our revenge on the hordes to the east, we need more weapons than ever.

 maghargma_crashing_the_feast_desc:0 "Far from the walls of Maghargma and on the frontlines with the northern tribes, the Doomhunger clan of Garsvulshim ultimately denounced our throne after our ancestors failed to defend their lands on multiple occasions.

 maghargma_lands_of_plenty_title:0 "Lands of Plenty"
 maghargma_lands_of_plenty_desc:0 "The fields of Garsvulshim are among the most fertile in the Kingdom, capable of supplying the warriors of the Doomhunger clan through long sieges and supplying the hedonistic victory feasts the clan is renowned for.

 maghargma_restoring_the_walls_title:0 "Restoring the Walls"
 maghargma_restoring_the_walls_desc:0 "Our grand capital of Maghargma is built within the looming ruins of a Cloud Giant castle that crashed soon after the Day of Ashen Skies. It almost instantly became the center of our civilization, a shining beacon of our power.\n\nCenturies of stagnation and neglect have taken their toll on the city however; the once great and magnificent walls are crumbled and stained. Before we begin renovations of our capital, we must make sure the walls are secure and sturdy."

 maghargma_royal_feasts_desc:0 "With the walls of Maghargma now rising high around our city, the people of Maghargma are jubilant, eager to see the resurrection of our greatness. We must hold a grand feast to commemorate this achievement, and for that we need new feasting halls."

They've gathered around the most popular feasting halls, bringing their retinues with them and establishing a bustling market within the heart of our city. The feasting halls have become grand meeting halls for our clans, and a prosperous center of trade for our merchants."
 maghargma_mining_hills_title:0 "Mine the Hills"
 maghargma_mining_hills_desc:0 "Maghargma is half buried into the mountains surrounding it, evidence of the cataclysmic crash that brought the city into our hands and its deceased inhabitants to our plates. Long ago, we mined the mountains for a variety of ores and precious gems, though years of neglect led to several of the tunnels collapsing and never opening again. Now, as we seek new wealth to support our Kingdom, we must reopen the mines of Maghargma and see what remains within the earth around us."
 maghargma_great_maghargma_title:0 "Palace of the Devoured Gods"
 maghargma_great_maghargma_desc:0 "The royal city of Maghargma is experiencing such grand prosperity unseen for centuries, as clans clash and feast within the halls and wealth flows from the hills around us. Now, we have constructed the centerpiece of our newly refurbished capital, a massive palace carved into the mountain and decorated with hundreds of statues and effigies constructed out of bone, granite, bronze, and many more.\n\nThe greatest work within the palace also acts as its namesake; an authentic Cloud Giant skeleton with a skin of steel and gems looks over the dining hall, a reminder of where we gained our power from. The Palace of the Devoured Gods now holds the great throne of our Kingdom, and is a clear sign of our supremacy."
 maghargma_subjugate_warlords_title:0 "Subjugating the Warlords"
 maghargma_subjugate_warlords_desc:0 "We have finally enforced our will upon our closest warlords, the Strongrock, Stoneheart, and Steelgrinder clans. With the backing of our loyal vassals, we can now devote our attentions to reining in our disobedient lords and the barbarians in the north."

 maghargma_military_reform_title:0 "Organizing the Warriors"
 maghargma_military_reform_desc:0 "The standard Ogre "army" is typically little more than a horde gathered up by a strong enough warrior and sent in a vague direction with instructions to obliterate and devour whatever gets in their way. While this may have worked in the past, as we move into the future we must bring some sort of unity within our ranks."
 maghargma_supreme_ogrelord_title:0 "Become the Mengurkha"
 maghargma_supreme_ogrelord_desc:0 "The title of Mengurkha, Ruler of Ogres, has been the true title of our King for eons, though many claim that we have not deserved such a distinguished position. Through great effort and luck, we have finally crawled out of the rotten pits of stagnation to reaffirm the power of Maghargma, and of the Ogre people. Now, as we move towards a brighter future, we need a crown to match our glory, to be placed upon the Mengurkha in a grand ceremony not witnessed in more than a thousand years."
 maghargma_conquer_the_horsemen_title:0 "Conquer the Horsemen"
 maghargma_conquer_the_horsemen_desc:0 "Now that we have risen from squalor we should now devote our attention towards the treacherous Centaurs to the east. While we should thank them for giving us the shock we needed to pull our realm out of stagnation, their betrayal cannot be forgotten, nor can it be forgiven. The warriors of the Mengotsa are ready to charge into the plains and feast upon the flesh of those that sought to conquer our lands and enslave our people!"

 maghargma_the_ogre_missive_desc:0 "As we wage our campaign of vengeance and expansion across the plains we have come into contact with a thriving land full of puny humans, gathered into a so called "Federation" for their own protection.
