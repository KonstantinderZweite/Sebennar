 L09_zuvavim_summer_relations_title:0 "Summer Relations"
 L09_zuvavim_summer_relations_desc:0 "The Vurebindu humans and the Vyzemby halflings used to view one another with great hostility. The former had fled Fangaula after the invasion of the mysterious Deep Devils, migrating into Horashesh where the sheltered sea granted them respite from the oceanic invaders. They forced the Vyzemby to abandon the ancient city state of Saikinoma, and built their own town of Zuvavim right next to the abandoned fortress.\n\nThat, however, was over 2,000 years ago. Anger gave way to distrust, which gave way to indifference and eventually to cooperation as the two sides of the Sea of Lel learned to live with one another. We have been at the forefront of this diplomatic effort - an effort whose importance only became more apparent after the collapse of Kheterata. Mihitarab is only our first friend amongst the halflings. We shall make many more as we attempt to keep Horashesh safe from further imperial powers."
 L09_zuvavim_ancient_ruins_title:0 "Ancient Ruins"
 L09_zuvavim_ancient_ruins_desc:0 "Zuvavim and Chibuswa once went by the names of Saikinoma and Vadronoma respectively. Back when the ancient, beehive-inspired fortresses stood as great outposts along the Sea of Lel, a testament to the time when the Vyzemby ruled the coast from Dao Nako to Horashesh. Their ruins today are dilapidated. Humans had little interest in excavating their remains, partly due to ancient magical wards the Vyzemby who abandoned them placed in their stone, but mostly because it’s hard for humans to make use of a building where the ceilings are all 4 ft high.\n\nThis attitude has been changing lately. With more Vyzemby moving to Zuvavim, a greater interest has been growing in renovating the Ananoma, and perhaps restoring them to the heights of splendour they once reached thousands of years ago."
 L09_zuvavim_restore_ananoma_title:0 "Restore the Ananoma"
 L09_zuvavim_restore_ananoma_desc:0 "The Ananoma stood as testaments to what Vyzemby engineering and construction was capable of. But over the years the Ananoma in Horashesh decayed and grew decrepit, the region’s new human inhabitants having little interest in the intricate hallways of the beehive citadels. Their fall still stings the hearts of the Vyzemby, and their ruins stand as a barrier between more positive relations between our people.\n\nRestore the Ananoma. Rebuild those ancient trade cities along the Sea of Lel. Once they stand again in all their splendour, the Vyzemby will have to concede that the ancient mainland city states could soon all be reborn under a new human Kolovadoy."
 L09_zuvavim_a_human_kolovadoy_title:0 "A Human Kolovadoy"
 L09_zuvavim_a_human_kolovadoy_desc:0 "As Horasheshi and Vyzemby tales have crossed the Sea of Lel, one that has captured the imagination of the Zuvavim people is of Jyva’s Kolovadoy. A great hero, blessed by the gods, who will reclaim the mainland and build a great civilisation across the seas. There are many different versions of this story, but interestingly not a single version mentions that the Kolovadoy had to be a halfling…"
 L09_our_shared_believes_title:0 "Our Shared Beliefs"
 L09_our_shared_believes_desc:0 "The Noukahi Pantheon is awash with tales of heroes from foreign lands. It doesn’t matter where in the world this person may have come from. If they accomplished incredible feats, they probably did so because they had been blessed by Zuvanofa, and upon death rose to the skies to sit beside the creator and watch over his people.\n\nGiven the long shared history between the Vyzemby and the Vurebindu, perhaps we should examine the heroes of our pantheon more closely and see if they share anything in common with those from across the Sea of Lel. It would help ease some of the distrust between our disparate faiths and demonstrate that perhaps our beliefs are not so far apart."
 L09_summer_trade_title:0 "Summer Trade"
 L09_summer_trade_desc:0 "Despite the ample trade opportunities in the Summer Isles, Kheterata never was able to establish good connections with the Vyzemby, in large part because they had little interest in their culture. To them, all Vyzemby halflings looked the same. If you can’t tell your Amezetany from your Mazava, how could you ever hope to profit in the Sea of Lel? Thankfully with Kheterata no longer controlling our foreign relations, we can re-establish diplomatic and trade connections with all the different Vyzemby."
 L09_summer_riches_title:0 "Summer Riches"
 L09_summer_riches_desc:0 "Merchants and traders from distant lands have been docking their ships in the ports along the Sea of Lel. There we show them our finest wares, such as our fine shawls and glass beadware, along with the many herbs and rugs made on the Summer Isles. Yet when they return to their homeland to sell their wares, those who return are seemingly after one thing only: cloves. Control over the trade of cloves has now become a national issue, which naturally means the Medawor and Efergezmu, plus their respective fleets, have started arguing over the issue."
 L09_end_kunolo_title:0 "End Kunolo"
 L09_end_kunolo_desc:0 "Kunolo was once Kolonoma, a thriving Vyzemby city and hub for the ancient trade between the mainland Vyzemby and those who still lived on Fahvanosy. Today the great Ananoma there lies in ruin. The city was built up around it, as everyone and anyone was allowed in, crushing the beloved history of the Vyzemby people underfoot.\n\nToday that ends. Vurebindu and Vyzemby interests have aligned due to the shared interest in crushing Kunolo. Under our guidance, we shall reclaim Kolonoma, crush any resistance, and bring the bay under our fleet’s control once again."
 L09_explore_the_ruins_title:0 "Exploring the Ruins"
 L09_explore_the_ruins_desc:0 "As work on restoring the Ananoma across Horashesh and Fangaula proceeds, many of the locals at these locations have talked about a mysterious “ghost halfling”. These stories are remarkably similar no matter their origin, whether they are from Dao Nako or even the magical Khawit forests. Ancient Vyzemby villages, flitting in and out of view, always on the edge of your vision, but disappearing as soon as you try to look at them. Many of the locals believe these are the Vyzemby who perished when their ancient city states collapsed, their spirits haunting these jungles. We need to investigate these rumours, lest they spook our populace and make them too terrified to move to the newly colonised lands."
 L09_secure_zena_title:0 "Secure Zena"
 L09_secure_zena_desc:0 "In retrospect, we may have chosen the wrong side during the War for Zena. We fought on the side of Kuiika, fearing the balance of power in Horashesh would shift too drastically should Kuiika be conquered. In the end, our fears were realised, except that imbalance came in the form of Kuiika greatly expanding their territory and announcing to Horashesh that they will be the ones to unite Horashesh, and plan to do so by force.\n\nIf Kuiika were to take the city of Bivuzena, we will be next on their warpath. The Zuvunwa people could find themselves entirely under the boot of Kuiika. We need to strip Kuiika of their gains and restore the old borders of Zena - under our guidance of course."
 L09_the_menace_curtailed_title:0 "The Menace Curtailed"
 L09_the_menace_curtailed_desc:0 "We have successfully turned back the tide of Kuiika’s imperialism. Zena has regained its lands, and the historical pastures of the Zuvunwa people. If we are to keep the future of the Zuvunwa people secure, we must unite under one banner. We’re sure the people of Zena will understand why we must unite. But just in case, send only our finest diplomats to avoid an embarrassing faux pas that could scupper the entire proposition."
 L09_southern_trade_title:0 "Southern Trade"
 L09_southern_trade_desc:0 "The endless bickering between the Sunsail and Steelwind fleets will tear our country apart if we don’t at some point choose a side. A remnant of the time when we were a Medasi under Kheterata, the two fleets owe their loyalties to either side of the Medawor and Efergezmu dispute. We are not in a position yet to demand one side stand down, so for now we must deal with their latest dispute over the important port of Bivuzena."
 L09_bickering_in_the_seas_title:0 "Bickering in the Seas"
 L09_bickering_in_the_seas_desc:0 "Kunolo was once a Medasi of Kheterata, much like we were. However they broke free of Kheterata long before we did, and taunted us with our inability to escape the empire’s grasp. What they didn’t understand was Kheterata helped fund the expansion and modernisation of our navy so we could control the Sea of Lel in their name. These funds did create our eternally bickering dual fleets, but a shared enemy in Kunolo could be what we need to put a temporary halt to their squabbles. "
 L09_end_the_menace_title:0 "End the Menace"
 L09_end_the_menace_desc:0 "As a Medasi under Kheterata, our rights were restricted and governors from distant Kheterat dictated what we could do. Yet even then we maintained a broad level of independence. It’s ironic that the greatest threat to our independence came after the collapse of Kheterata in the form of one of our fellow Vurebindu brothers.\n\nThat threat has been curtailed. The dream of a Kuiikan Empire, so proudly declared by their leaders, has ended. We will be the ones to unite the Vurebindu people, not under Kuivahni militarism, but under our more refined rule."
 L09_a_vurebindu_country_title:0 "A Vurebindu Country"
 L09_a_vurebindu_country_desc:0 "The Vurebindu people have never been united. Warring tribes fought amongst each other ever since we first migrated to Horashesh over 2,000 years ago. Instead we were subjugated by either the accursed Karassian Lizardfolk Empire, or the distant empire of Kheterata. That ends today. Every Vurebindu man, woman, and child have been united under the banner of Zuvavim. A bright and glorious future for the Vurebindu people awaits."
 L09_facing_the_dragon_title:0 "Facing the Dragon"
 L09_facing_the_dragon_desc:0 "There is yet one final thread left over from the War for Zena we must untangle. When the Kuiikan menace sent their warriors into the jungles of Gomuvuri, the Gomuvuri warriors sought protection from the soldiers at the fortress of Aramoole. At the time we didn’t understand why the Kuiikan forces did not continue their push, as a distant Kheteratan outpost did not seem like it would put up much of a fight. Later we learned of what spooked them: a dragon!\n\nIt seems impossible to believe, but supposedly the great bronze dragon of Kheterata had taken up residence in Aramoole and was directing their actions behind the scene. No dragons have been spotted flying over the mountains since, but a rumour like that can dampen the enthusiasm of even the most bravehearted general. That incident was decades ago though. We have proven our strength to Gomuvuri. They would be better united under the rule of a fellow Vurebindu state."

 flavor_zuvavim.1.d:0 " Every griot carries their masks of many faces. It has become synonymous with the Noukahi Pantheon religion, and is the tool they use to weave their tales, shifting the mask to take the role of different characters. It can be Zuvanofa, the creator, blessing the Medaka of Zuvavim to be the ones to unite Horashesh. Shift the mask ever so slightly and the griot becomes Jyva, the Vyzemby goddess of magic, who made the prophecy of the Kolovadoy who would return the halflings to the mainland.\n\nWith a quick change in stance and twist of the mask, the griot becomes the jealous Vyzemby king, claiming that no human could possibly claim the title of Kolovadoy. Stand up straight, flip the mask around, and now they’re the great human builder who discovered the secrets of the Ananoma and how to restore them to their previous heights.\n\nThis is the story of Zuvavim. How they, blessed by Zuvanofa and led by their wise Medaka, brought the halflings back to the mainland. They restored the Ananoma and built a glorious empire on both shores of the sea. The legend of the Kolovadoy has been realised - a Human Kolovadoy."

Those cities have been rebuilt and halflings walk their streets again, but at the top stands not a halfling, but a human.\n\nZuvavim claims to be the Kolodavoy and has extended an invitation for us to join them as a united people once again. Shall we accept?"

 flavor_zuvavim.3.d:0 "Everyone in both Horashesh and Fahvanosy knows the story of what happened to the Ananoma. The Vyzemby abandoned the mainland and sailed back to the Summer Isles in the wake of the Deep Devil invasion and subsequent human migrations.\n\nWhat is less known is that not every Vyzemby left the mainland. Many left the comfort of the Ananoma and ventured deep into the jungles of Khawit and Dao Nako, where they erected highly complex illusionary veils around the villages so they wouldn’t fall to the same fate as their fellow halflings. There these villages have remained, hidden from view, their veils dropping only in brief moments to lost travellers who return with tales of “ghostly” halflings that disappeared right in front of their eyes.\n\nOr at least, that’s what the rumours say. With our rebuilding of the Ananoma and the relationship between human and halfling at the best they’ve ever been, we can invite these “ghost” halflings back into our fold. Prepare the expeditions into Khawit and Dao Nako. Human and halfling alike will venture into these magical jungles and recover these lost tribes."

 flavor_zuvavim.4.t:0 "Exploration of the Ananoma Ruins Completed"
 flavor_zuvavim.4.d:0 "Hydras rearing out of the swamps. Glades of trees made entirely of iron, as far as the eye could see. Sleeping golems of the ancient Fangaulan Empire, inert and covered in vines. The stories the Dao Nako expedition returned with painted an awe-inspiring yet terrifying picture of what lay deep in that jungle.\n\nDespite their extensive travails, the expedition were not able to uncover any of the mysterious “ghost” halfling villages. On multiple occasions they did encounter ethereal figures flitting between the trees that resembled Vyzemby - perhaps they were the ghost halflings? But any attempt to chase them down failed.\n\nBut they did not return empty-handed, for the Dao Nako was full of treasures. Most fascinating of all were hexagon-shaped stones, seemingly of genie origin, that resembled a miniature version of the Ananoma. When taken into the old Vyzemby fortresses, the magic infused in the stones dispelled many of the old magical barriers that had made exploring the Ananoma so difficult for our people."
 flavor_zuvavim.4.a:0 "How fascinating"
 
 flavor_zuvavim.5.t:0 "Mysteries of Khawit"
 flavor_zuvavim.5.d:0 "It had been two years since the Dao Nako and Khawit expeditions set off, and over a year since the Dao Nako expedition returned. Nobody expected the Khawit expedition to take this long - it took barely a day’s travel from Zuvavim to enter the jungle after all. Yet Khawit has its reputation for a reason. You do not leave the path if you ever want to return, or the way back will disappear behind you and you become another lost soul who wanders its depths for all eternity.\n\nThe Khawit expedition was not to be one of those lost in Khawit. It may have taken two years, but the bedraggled team returned, seemingly confused on the season or even the year. Some members believed they had been gone for over a decade, while others believed it was no more than three months. They only escaped when one member tripped over a rock pile, breaking an ancient illusion spell and finding themselves suddenly standing in the middle of a Vyzemby village.\n\nOnce the initial shock and hostility gave way and the two sides started communicating, the reality had dawned on the expedition what they had uncovered. This was one of the legendary ghost halfling tribes! Lost for almost 2,000 years, finally reunited with halflings from Fahvanosy. The Vyzemby were able to guide the expedition out of the forest, with promises that the expedition would return with gifts of gratitude.\n\nWithin a few weeks, numerous other ghost halfling villages were uncovered in Khawit. Most of them, while not hostile, had little interest in the outside world. They had legends of the famous beehive fortresses, but viewed Khawit as their home. However, some more adventurous among them did leave with the group to see the Ananoma, standing proud and restored to the full glory as spoken about in the tales told to them as children."

 flavor_zuvavim.6.t:0 "Our Shared Beliefs"
 flavor_zuvavim.6.d:0 "Every adult and child in Zuvavim has heard a griot tell the tale of Noromhanda, the great warrior king of legend who defeated the genie sultan to free the ancestors of the Vurebindu people from his tyrannical rule. One of the key details from that famous story is when Noromhanda was taken to a shrine by his wife to tend to his wounds, where seahorses assisted in his recovery. The seahorse part of the story was always seen as a touch fanciful, perhaps put there by a talented griot to establish some thematic connection between Noromhanda and the sea.\n\nYet stand in front of the Temple of Lel at the centre of this great Vyzemby city, and you start to wonder if you were wrong to doubt that famous story. Adorned with giant seahorse mosaics which clearly tell the very same story of Noromhanda’s wife tending to her husband’s wounds. Although not every detail of the old tale lines up with how the mosaics tell it. Noromhanda is depicted as a halfling for starters - the Vyzemby call him Kolo - and he stands along with his wife Lel at the top of the pantheon of Vyzemby gods.\n\nThis could have been a sticking point in our burgeoning friendship with the Vyzemby, but thankfully Vurebindu culture never lets a good story get in the way of a relationship. To think our two faiths shared heroes at its summit! The city of Lelanán can be a bridge with the Vyzemby and show that so much more connects us than divides us."

The Dawyaw Fleet wants to impose a blockade on the large city, slowly draining their will to fight.\n\nHowever the new, young admiral of the Movuma Fleet has proposed another strategy that could prove much more devastating for Kunolo. Rather than blockade the port, the fleet would wait for the ships to leave the harbour, then sink them to the bottom of the Sea of Lel. A more risky strategy that would require greater up-front funding, but more devastating to Kunolo in the long run. "

The first fist was thrown by a member of the Movuma royal family who was regaling tales of the original Vurebindu flight from Fangaula two millenia earlier in the wake of the Deep Devil invasion, until he was interrupted by a member of the Efergezmu asking what plans he had made to retake the coastline.\n\nApparently, unbeknownst to the Efergezmu, members of the Dawyaw royal family had spent the past decade drawing up a detailed re-colonization plan for the Dao Nako coastline, targeting in particular the points where the old Ananoma ruins stand today. The Movuma royalty’s lack of planning for the recolonization was mocked, some very demeaning things were said about Vurebindu intellect or lack thereof, and a brawl broke out. Now the Efergezmu are refusing to listen to any plans put forward by the Medawor for the colonisation of the coast."

Descended from generations of Kheteratan seafarers, his voice carries a lot of weight amongst the Medawor - and garners distrust amongst the Efergezmu. The Amaru family have been a loud voice in promoting Kheteratan culture in Zuvavim for generations, so favouring his approach would undoubtedly upset those of the Movuma Fleet, who have grown wealthy off the lucrative Summer Isles trade."

Right now the Porhonozy Islands are home to little more than some island-hopping tribal lizardfolk, and using the resources in Bivuzena to build new ports on those islands would secure our control of the sea for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe admiral of the Movuma fleet thinks the entire idea is absurd and a massive waste of resources. Controlling both Zuvavim and Bivuzena is already enough to command complete control of the Sea of Lel, and we would be much better off diverting all our resources into building a large new trade district in the section of Bivuzena across the bay that was torched during the War for Zena."

Yet they have been struggling to find new sailors. Not for a lack of willing new seamen, as many have been joining the rivalling Movuma fleet, despite its lower training standards. The predominantly Noukahi Pantheon recruits cited an old Dawyaw policy that no ship can be captained by a non-khetist. This rule was dropped years ago, but the rumours persist, perhaps because despite the official rule no longer being in place, it unofficially remains in place as no captain currently in the fleet is of a non-khetist faith.\n\nWe could raise a new ship with a promising Noukahi Pantheon officer to be its captain, yet grant it to the Dawyaw fleet, a solution that would satisfy both sides.

The Medawor who oversees the Dawyaw Fleet’s finances has even promised to do it for free, as the chance to embarrass their rival fleet is worth far more to them than gold. Alternatively, the head admirals of the Movuma Fleet could be fired and a new batch of sailors, ones who won’t simply take the same predictable routes every time they set sail, could be promoted."

Yet not a single pirate has attacked the Dawyaw Fleet. The Efergezmu are incensed, believing that the Medawor have been paying pirates to attack the Movuma Fleet to weaken the Efergezmu’s position in Zuvavim.\n\nThe arguments came to a head at the council in Zuvavim yesterday when a leading member of the Medawor, when presented with evidence that the Medawor were paying lizardfolk pirates to attack the Movuma Fleet, told the admiral in chief that he simply needed to “get better” at fighting pirates. In the ensuing fight, at least two members of the Medawor were knocked unconscious by an elephant tusk swung across a table. We need to decide how to handle the situation before the arguments start again."

Apparently the fight started when it was discovered that the Movuma Fleet had been selling fake cloves to the Efergezmu - an elaborate scheme that involved placing twigs in clove barrels so they would absorb the scent, then break off small pieces and claim they were cloves.\n\nThat wasn’t what kicked off the riot though. What turned a fraudulent trade deal into a full blown fight was when a khetist admiral of the Dawyaw Fleet who discovered the fake cloves swung a scimitar and chopped off the Efergezmu captain’s head with one clean movement. That sparked the chaos, and although today’s fighting has ended, if we don’t deal with the problem soon, it will undoubtedly start up again elsewhere in Zuvavim."
