 brambleskinner_repel_the_orcs_title:0 "Repel the Orcs"
 brambleskinner_repel_the_orcs_desc:0 "The arrival of orcs has been a bittersweet boon to us, as it forced Oubblig the Traitor to reveal his pact with the fey. But they are strong and most view us as little more than slaves. Now that we grew big enough, we should make sure to teach the orcish invaders a lesson so that they can never threaten us again."

 brambleskinner_pactbreakers_title:0 "Pactbreakers"
 brambleskinner_pactbreakers_desc:0 "At last, it is time for us to face the most powerful force that still opposes us beneath the trees. The elves, with their fey supporters, are a constant reminder that the future of our clans is still not secured. Unless we shatter the Verdant Pact once and for all, and show the sallas and the fey that we are the true rulers of the Deepwoods. "

 brambleskinner_friends_under_the_trees_title:0 "Friends under the Trees"
 brambleskinner_friends_under_the_trees_desc:0 "We are surrounded by enemies and must find allies that are not bound to the fey. The Spiked Log clan may be a suitable candidate, as they excel in both traps and boar-mounting. Yet, they are threatened by the bloodthirsty Relgakk Blackmoon. Maybe we can help them with their ordeal?"

 brambleskinner_a_slaughterer_crushed_title:0 "A Slaughterer Crushed"
 brambleskinner_a_slaughterer_crushed_desc:0 "Relgakk Blackmoon is dead, and the Arrow grove is now under goblin control. It will be an advantage for us in our war against the fey as long as we can secure our relations with the Spiked Log Clan. Our work is done and it is time for them to meet their part of the deal."

 brambleskinner_rein_in_the_wayward_clans_title:0 "Rein in the Wayward Clans"
 brambleskinner_rein_in_the_wayward_clans_desc:0 "We profoundly distrust any goblin who seeks to make a pact with the fey. And even if Oubblig’s clan’s errors have been partially righted, there are still two major clans that persist in this fallacy - Petalmasher and Verminhusk. We should take control of them, and they will make fine additions to the Feykiller Front."

 brambleskinner_streamline_payroll_title:0 "Streamline Payroll"
 brambleskinner_streamline_payroll_desc:0 "Verminhusk, our subordinate clan, neighbours the gold mine of Yfelorr. We will create a shared cartel tasked with the minting of our money. With that newfound control, we would then be able to streamline the recruitment and payroll of our growing military."

 brambleskinner_punish_the_traitor_title:0 "Punish the Traitor"
 brambleskinner_punish_the_traitor_desc:0 "The despicable Oubblig has betrayed us, made a pact with the fey, and used his power to take over our clan. Even if he died ten years ago, his followers survived and still revere him. We must crush them, and bring Oubblig’s legacy down by fire and blades!"

 brambleskinner_back_in_our_fold_title:0 "Back in our Fold"
 brambleskinner_back_in_our_fold_desc:0 "Oubblig's legacy is gone; his influence wanes day by day. Now we must reunite our clans and make sure no one among us ever succumbs again to the enticing promises of the fey."

 brambleskinner_two_clans_one_boss_title:0 "Two Clans, One Boss"
 brambleskinner_two_clans_one_boss_desc:0 "When integrating Oubbligschild, we noticed that they were organised very differently from us. Oubblig, for once, did something clever: he let some subordinates do most of the work for him. It seems efficient, we should do the same!"

 brambleskinner_the_feykiller_front_title:0 "The Feykiller Front"
 brambleskinner_the_feykiller_front_desc:0 "Oubbligschild is no more, and Spiked Log has accepted our leadership. Our clans are stronger than ever. With this foundation, we can now increase our war effort against the fey. Beforehands, we need Spiked Log help to fortify our lands."

 brambleskinner_recruit_alchemists_title:0 "Recruit Alchemists"
 brambleskinner_recruit_alchemists_desc:0 "Petalmasher has a long tradition of alchemy, but their alchemists are a disorganised group that rarely work with outsiders. If we set up a cartel to coordinate them, they will both bring us rare materials and test new ideas as we desperately need an edge in our war against the fey."

 brambleskinner_merge_the_cartels_title:0 "Merge the Cartels"
 brambleskinner_merge_the_cartels_desc:0 "We no longer are the disorganised clan we once were. Using our dependable subordinate clans and our efficient cartels, we prospered and even managed to overcome the fey and their followers. Our future is bright, and it is time for us to embrace it."

 brambleskinner_the_fireproof_mill_title:0 "The Fireproof Mill"
 brambleskinner_the_fireproof_mill_desc:0 "The deadly explosion of our blackpowder district made many wonder whether we should be more careful in our development of new weaponry. But why should we? We only have to build a mill that will not break nor burn even if a similar incident happens again."

 brambleskinner_clear_the_forest_title:0 "Clear the Forest"
 brambleskinner_clear_the_forest_desc:0 "We need more space for our population and our increasing needs. Spiked Log have a lot of experience cutting trees, and their land is home for a lot of Feystompers - powerful warmounts, yet also great draft animals. With their help, we’ll create a cartel tasked with clearing the forest; it will be the cornerstone of our growth."

 brambleskinner_char_the_forest_title:0 "Char the Forest"
 brambleskinner_char_the_forest_desc:0 "A key ingredient in the production of blackpowder is charcoal, and we need a lot of it. It can also be a core material to strengthen our manufacturing sector. Fortunately, there are plenty of trees around for us to burn, we just need to make the most of them with the help of the Treecutters Cartel!"

 brambleskinner_develop_new_weapons_title:0 "Develop New Weapons"
 brambleskinner_develop_new_weapons_desc:0 "With our supply of blackpowder secured, we can now focus on inventing ways to use it and improve it even more. The Alchemy Cartel already has groundbreaking ideas but they need proper facilities to develop them. We will make our capital into a thriving weapon-making city!"

 brambleskinner_friends_under_the_sun_title:0 "Friends under the Sun"
 brambleskinner_friends_under_the_sun_desc:0 "Thanks to our fight against Oubbligschild, we now own land outside the Deepwoods. We have new neighbours, including other goblins. And they don't revere the fey. We should become friends!"

 brambleskinner_a_promise_fulfilled_title:0 "A Promise Fulfilled"
 brambleskinner_a_promise_fulfilled_desc:0 "We promised to help Landshark secure Ourdia and bring down the decaying kingdom that survived there. In exchange, they will secure our western border and allow us to focus on the threats lurking beneath the Woods."

 brambleskinner_seashark_title:0 "Seashark"
 brambleskinner_seashark_desc:0 "The sea. So much water, yet it is impossible to drink it. Such a waste! Fortunately, the Landshark clan is able to use it to trade with other countries. If we set up a joint cartel, they’ll teach us how to make use of the sea to get information and rare goods!"

 brambleskinner_sulfurous_trade_title:0 "Sulfurous Trade"
 brambleskinner_sulfurous_trade_desc:0 "While we can get charcoal and saltpeter from within the Deepwoods, sulfur is harder to obtain from our lands. We should ask the people south of Ourdia if they could sell some to us - using the human merchants from Landshark and the Shippers Cartel to make sure the transactions go well."

 brambleskinner_damage_control_title:0 "Damage Control"
 brambleskinner_damage_control_desc:0 "We may have messed up a bit too much with the fey, and it seems the very forest has turned on us. We have to quell that rebellion. While we're at it, we should also make our country safer against future attacks."

Should they succeed, they ask in exchange for our loyalty. It may be a small price to pay for our survival, as Relgakk Blackmoon is a danger for all goblins in the Deepwoods.

 flavor_brambleskinner.2.d_1:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetTitle], our envoys to the Spiked Log clan came back with their answer. We offered our trusted ally our assistance in crushing Relgakk Blackmoon and in securing the Arrow grove. When we succeed, we ask them in exchange to pledge their loyalty to us.

 flavor_brambleskinner.2.c:0 "The cowards refused!"
 flavor_brambleskinner.2.e:0 "We will be stronger together!"

 flavor_brambleskinner.3.t:0 "A Durable Arrangement"
 flavor_brambleskinner.3.d:0 "Relgakk Blackmoon is no more, and the Spiked Log clan is safe. For now. Even with the Arrow grove under their grasp, other countries are waiting to seize their lands. Blackmoon is dead but numerous orcish warbands still view us as little more than slaves. As for the elves, they always seek to take back what they see as their legitimate possessions. Who knows for how long their squabbles will prevent them from attacking with the full might of their Verdant Pact? It would be in Spiked Log’s best interest to accept our rule and receive permanent protection."
 flavor_brambleskinner.3.a:0 "We upheld our part of the arrangement, now it is their turn."

 flavor_brambleskinner.4.t:0 "Brambleskinner demands fealty"
 flavor_brambleskinner.4.d_1:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetTitle], envoys from Brambleskinner have come. They demand our fealty as a reward from their assistance. They did help us in our fight with Relgakk Blackmoon and in securing the Arrow grove, and we had agreed to pledge our loyalty to them if they won."
 flavor_brambleskinner.4.d_2:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetTitle], envoys from Brambleskinner have come. They gave us the land they owned in Ourdia, but they demand our fealty as a reward from their assistance. They did help us in securing our new home, and we had agreed to pledge our loyalty to them if they won."
 flavor_brambleskinner.4.a:0 "Why should we comply? We would have won anyway."
 flavor_brambleskinner.4.b:0 "A deal is a deal."

 flavor_brambleskinner.5.t:0 "The Conclave of [Root.Capital.GetName]"
 flavor_brambleskinner.5.d_1:0 ""We need to increase our efforts to fight the fey."\n\nOur subordinate and allied clans’ representatives nodded.\n\n"It will be a lengthy undertaking. As long as anyone in this forest errs in the belief that they can seek pacts with the fey, we will not be done. Oubblig’s treason shall never repeat itself."\n\nThe representative from Oubbligschild looked down, visibly uncomfortable, and begrudgingly replied :\n\n"You are right, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. And I think our first target should be the other goblin clans, Petalmasher and Verminhusk. We should strike fast and bring them under your rule."\n\n"What about the bloodthirsty orcs?" - the representative from Spiked Log interrupted - "they are mighty and who knows when another Blackmoon will rise in power?"\n\n"Hold your Feystomper. We must not forget the elves and their cursed Verdant Pact. Must I remind you all our capital is almost under Salla Elyn’s grasp?"\n\nThe envoy from Landshark hesitantly raised their hand :\n\n"[Root.Monarch.GetTitle], this is indeed a… worthy endeavour… but do you know how you will fund it? If not, I may have an idea for you."\n\n"Go ahead."\n\n"You could create organisations dedicated to making money, or anything you could need. We, for one, could help with your outside trade, and give you back substantial benefits."\n\n"Like some sort of cartels? It seems like a sensible idea. We all agree then. And remember…""

 flavor_brambleskinner.5.a:0 "... a good fey is a dead fey."

 flavor_brambleskinner.6.t:0 "Distant Cousins"
 flavor_brambleskinner.6.d:0 "For the first time in aeons, we left the Deepwoods. Trapped in the Verdant Veil, we were bound home, for decades and centuries. Yet we followed the Oubbligschild clan outside, under the bright and blinding sun, to make sure Oubblig’s legacy had fully disappeared. There, where the forest, the mountain and the sea meet, we discovered overly-proud humans, hailing from a secular and decaying kingdom. There also were peculiar goblins who told us they escaped the orcish yoke. They were a bit different from the ones that came to us with the Greentide, but they were friendly nevertheless. Maybe we should ally with them so they would secure our western border."
 flavor_brambleskinner.6.a:0 "New friends, maybe?"

 flavor_brambleskinner.7.t:0 "The Forest and the Sea"
 flavor_brambleskinner.7.d:0 "Ourdia is gone. With the fall of their precious Bal Ouord, the ancient kingdom finally crumbled against our armies. Their powerless allies could only witness their downfall and failed to prevent it. Most Ourdi now live under goblin rule. Landshark, our trusted ally, stands stronger than ever in their newfound home, secure at last against their neighbours. As a token of goodwill, and because they would be better defended that way, we agreed to cede our outside lands to them. In exchange, and in accordance with our deal, it is now time for them to comply and become our subordinates."
 flavor_brambleskinner.7.a:0 "Let them handle the sea shore for our ennemies lie deep within the Woods."

 flavor_brambleskinner.8.t:0 "A Rumor from Bal Ouord"
 flavor_brambleskinner.8.d:0 ""Why does it behave that way? Charcoal should burn, not explode! There’s something else mixed with it. Sulfur maybe? But in which proportion? Such a frustrating and amazing mystery!"\n\nZunewl Fireblood turned around from her experiment table, a large stone slab cluttered with glass vials, brass contraptions, scribbled parchments, and, in the middle, a small tin ornate box full of a black powder. Scanning the messy laboratory through the thick, coloured and irritating fumes, she soon found the one who may hold the answer. A tall merchant in fancy clothes, curled up as far from the table as possible, side-eyeing the goblin alchemist with apprehension and disbelief at her reckless behaviour.\n\n"You there, human, are you sure you don’t know how this powder is made?"\n\n"I already told you, no, I don’t. Can I please go back to Bal Ouord? I was only told to bring the powder to you, not to assist you with your… experiments! This is madness!"\n\n"Come on, you’re already there, you should make yourself useful! Isn’t this fascinating?"\n\n"I swear in the name of Ara, the Shippers Cartel will hear of this!"\n\nSome weeks later, after a particularly loud detonation, Zunewl Fireblood stepped out of her smoky laboratory, with a satisfied grin on her face. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] would be delighted to learn that the formula to make blackpowder has finally been found, through trials and many, many errors."
 flavor_brambleskinner.8.a:0 "Fascinating stuff, it will be a great boon for our country!"

 flavor_brambleskinner.9.t:0 "Firework Celebration"
 flavor_brambleskinner.9.d:0 ""Are you sure this is a good idea?"\n\n"Of course! Evidently, you will have to spend a significant amount of money with the free samples and the public displays, but it will help you in the long run. If you want to sell your new… how are they called again?"\n\n"Sparklers, firecrackers, Ourdian candles and…"\n\n"Right, right. Dear, your products are good but you’ll need to find more enticing names. These are too bland. You want to make our clans’ members and our trading partners crave them. And that is not happening with such mundane names."\n\nGarut Halfblood gritted his teeth. The pompous and lofty merchant was getting on his nerves but he needed his guidance. And if he antagonised the man, he would become the enemy of the whole Shippers Cartel, and that would be a disaster. Relations between the cartels were not always smooth but open conflict was strictly forbidden by the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. As the Alchemists’ representative, he simply could not afford to mess up.\n\n"I’ll see what I can find. We need to make this celebration a success. The cost of inventing new weapons for the clan’s military is steep and we desperately need to find a new source of income."\n\n"A problem even for the best of us. It is no surprise the most spendthrift cartel faces it too. It has been, what, a year since you finally inaugurated your blackpowder district? How are you still not making money?"\n\n"Do I need to remind you that blackpowder is not free? You charge us a hefty tariff for the sulfur you buy for us! And we do not know how long the support from the Minters will last… Anyway. On behalf of my Cartel, I officially thank you for your precious advice. With this celebration, everyone will want to buy our new fireworks!""
 flavor_brambleskinner.9.a:0 "Free samples? Who would refuse?"

 flavor_brambleskinner.10.t:0 "Daytime Fireworks"
 flavor_brambleskinner.10.d:0 "Like every afternoon, [Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Dynasty.GetName] was reading the last reports from [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] subordinates clans and from the cartels. Nothing really struck [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] as new. [Root.Monarch.GetHerHisCap] advisors often said [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] endeavour was pointless and that [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] should focus on other more pressing tasks. But [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] knew that making sure everybody did their job well was of utmost importance. Without the cartels’ support, the country would surely bankrupt, and the subordinate clans could warn [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] of impending threats.\n\nThis afternoon, however, an incident broke [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] routine. It started with a flash, followed by a familiar detonation. Fireworks maybe? But when [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] palace started to shake, [Root.Monarch.GetName] knew something was amiss. Rushing to the window as more blasts resounded, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] could only witness the apocalyptic scene unfolding before [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]. Flames engulfed the once-proud and powerful [Root.Capital.GetName] and, before [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] very eyes, one of the buildings in the Blackpowder District exploded. A flash, a detonation, and yet another tremor shaking up to the foundations of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] very world. Years of hard work, disappearing in a matter of minutes.\n\nOxa Silentfeet, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] closest aid, stormed into [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s office.\n\n"[Root.Monarch.GetTitle], we have to leave now, the palace is no longer safe."\n\n"Quick, take these ledgers, they must be protected at all costs! Ashen Skies, this is terrible!"\n\n"I’ll see what I can take but you must go now, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]! Saving your life takes priority!"\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] reluctantly put down the heavy books and started to run toward the palace backdoor. Who was responsible for this mess? Surely this was not caused by negligence or reckless behaviour. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] had made sure to oversee the production of blackpowder by reading every single report coming from the Alchemists Cartel. The fey! It must be the fey who did this! But how could their influence reach the very heart of our city?"
 flavor_brambleskinner.10.a:0 "I will get the bottom of it!"

 flavor_brambleskinner.11.t:0 "The Forest Stirs"
 flavor_brambleskinner.11.d:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Dynasty.GetName] paced up and down in front of the command tent hurriedly set up on the outskirts of [Root.Capital.GetName]. Holding a hand-drawn map of the capital, he was witnessing the damage. Thick smoke was still rising up from the smouldering ruins, accumulating in a stale and acrid smog. Putting out the fire had been a massive undertaking, even with the nearby river. This morning, the search and rescue began but there was little hope in saving anyone. What a waste! So many lives lost, and so much money! As [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] contemplated the desolation, Oxa Silentfeet rushed to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] side.\n\n"[Root.Monarch.GetTitle], messages have come from Spiked Log, Verminhusk and Petalmasher. They are reporting massive attacks from the fey!"\n\n"I knew they were involved in this mess! What about our own lands?"\n\n"We have similar reports from the Bone and Thorn groves, although we have no news from our more distant lands yet."\n\n"Mobilise the army immediately. Rebuilding our capital will have to wait. We can not afford to lose any land to the treacherous fey. And make sure every soldier is well equipped. Use any remaining stockpile of blackpowder."\n\n"Very well, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. I’ll personally see to… Wait. Did you see that?"\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] scanned the forest edge, trying to spot what had just startled [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] trusted aid. Nothing. Just trees, waving as if animated by an ominous wind. Through the stagnant air, something suddenly reached his ears. A murmur from beyond reality, as if whispered by a being as old as the forest itself.\n\n"You have disturbed our rest. You created weapons of fire and destruction. You have defied us for too long, but your madness ends here and now."\n\nFor a moment, the whole forest froze. In an eerie silence, the whole camp gradually stopped bustling. Every goblin stood still, watching the forest in apprehension. Then, as if coming from their darkest nightmares, the trees began to unearth themselves, one after the other. Treants, everywhere. The fey had come for vengeance."

The few elven survivors are fleeing, their morale shattered by their bitter defeat. The Verdant Pact failed to protect them from our determined armies.\n\n"Formally dissolving the Pact will be our first demand, as disunited elves will be no threat for us. Good riddance! With this victory, we showed the elves that we are the undisputed rulers of the Deepwoods. With this victory, the fey’s influence will dwindle with the rout of their last worshippers. With this victory, our pledge is fulfilled. I hereby declare the Feykiller Front accomplished, for the stain of Oubblig’s betrayal is finally and thoroughly cleansed.""

[Root.Monarch.GetName], our generous [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], proclaims this to be an unprecedented festival, to consecrate our new [Root.GovernmentName]! Rejoice and triumph, for we are moving forwards to a better future thanks to our praiseworthy Cartels!"\n\nZamit "Burnt Eye" hurried past the crier down a busy street. The Builders branch of the Treecutters Cartel did a good job here, as the clean and colourful homes bore no trace of the terrible fire that nearly destroyed [Root.Capital.GetName]. As a top executive in the new Artificers branch he personally created as an offshoot of the Alchemists Cartel, Burnt Eye’s work for the day was just beginning. The celebration would come later. Tonight, the whole city will witness his work and the worth of his cartel will finally be acknowledged once and for all.\n\nHe rushed through the door of his laboratory, and, moments later, exited the building, carrying a long, narrow box. One of the inventions he was most proud of. He strided much more carefully towards the palace and entered the training grounds. He delicately unboxed his masterpiece and, for the hundredth time, checked for any defect. Any incident would be a disaster for him and his career. One hour left before the big reveal.\n\n"[Root.Monarch.GetTitle], thank you for taking time for this lowly tinkerer. I hereby present to you the future of our military. Behold! It is called the Bramble-Burner. While it looks like a regular rifle, it actually can breathe fire! It will strike fear in the hearts of our enemies, and burn them as surely as any foliage blocking the path of our armies."\n\nAs Burnt Eye proceeded to demonstrate the handling of the dreadful weapon on wooden dummies under the scrutinising gaze of the country’s various generals and officers, the night slowly fell. For once, the city lights were put out, to much of the partying population bewilderment.\n\nSoon, high in the sky under the unblinking stars, a rose bloomed, shining bright in hues of crimson and purple. The detonation reached the crowds, struck speechless in admiration. The next flower hatched, a golden lily inlaid with silver. Then a tangled bramble with white flowers and dark blue berries. One after the other, the pyrotechnic marvels flared through the night sky, ending with an awe-inspiring bouquet of multicoloured flowers sculpted in fire and glitter. As the city lights were kindled again, the crowds erupted in cheers and laughter. The first Fireflower Festival had truly begun."

 artifice_invention_bramble_burners_desc:0 "Bramble-Burners combine two of our most famed weapons: guns and fire. It can shoot bullets in long ranges like regular rifles, but its main feature is the reloadable cartridge bellow the barrel. Filled with specially refined blackpowder, it releases a middle-range flame breath, useful for both carbonizing the ennemy and clearing dense foliage. Despite our best efforts, Bramble-Burners are sometimes unreliable, but even if they rarely malfunction, we always can craft new ones... and find new goblins to use them. Due to its undeserved reputation to be a somewhat-risky weapon, Bramble-Burners are solely used by our most reckless officers and artificer regiments."
