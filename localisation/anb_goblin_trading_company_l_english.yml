 flavor_goblin_trading_company.1.t:0 "Choosing a Capital"
 flavor_goblin_trading_company.1.d:0 "As the goblins look out at the new empire its borders feel endless from where we began. What started off as a small southern kingdom now controls at least all of eastern escann from the mountains to the western walls of castonath and down to the mysterious deepwoods. A goblins surveyor comes by to offer a new location for our capital. There are many locations that are now open to us for a permenant residence. Each location will bring its own benifits to our empire. Marrhold can use their deep hold to produce our tanks even cheaper, Steelhyl increasing our morale as its been built on the capital of our enslavers, upper castonath will show us how to increase our production, lower castonath can be used for their endless houses to fill our populations and south castonath will show us how to properly develop our nation."

 flavor_goblin_trading_company.3.d:0 "The fires of the forges are lit. The day has come to make the weapon that will define our nation. The best metalsmiths were picked from across the country and the highest quality iron brought to the fires. The naming was a long and difficult process but decided on a simple name of goblinsblade as this is the pinnical of goblin ingenuity so we can go for a nice simple name here. Finally the blade is complete and soon our greatest project will be shown to the greater world."
 flavor_goblin_trading_company.3.a:0 "We are ready for the world stage"

 flavor_goblin_trading_company.5:0 "A New Future"
 flavor_goblin_trading_company.5.t:0 "A New Future"
 flavor_goblin_trading_company.5.d:0 "First we subjugated the deepwoods, fought the fey and then brought them to our heels. Then we brought the northern serpentspine under our control which now brings the question do we expand on the serpentspine companies giving up our dream of goblinsteel or do we bring more control into the deepwoods and allow ourselves the ability to make an armys worth of goblinsteel for our tanks"
 flavor_goblin_trading_company.5.a:0 "Expanding the companies will be most important"
 flavor_goblin_trading_company.5.b:0 "Goblinsteel for the armies will be most important"

 flavor_goblin_trading_company.6:0 "Into the Serpentspine"
 flavor_goblin_trading_company.6.t:0 "Into the Serpentspine"
 flavor_goblin_trading_company.6.d:0 "The fey are nominally agreeing with our conquests of the deepwoods and the supplies of feywood are coming in so now we can focus our attention elsewhere, the serpentspine. The serpentspine has the mithril we need to actually make the goblinsteel that was imagined all those years ago"
 flavor_goblin_trading_company.6.a:0 "The mountains will shake from our might!"

 flavor_goblin_trading_company.7:0 "Western Pacts Set"
 flavor_goblin_trading_company.7.t:0 "Western Pacts Set"
 flavor_goblin_trading_company.7.d:0 "The western fey have decided to work with as us long as we allow them to play their petty tricks on us and we humor them with it. Of course we will for a time, maybe 10 years? Theres no reason to let the fey do what they want we just need them to work with us and im sure they will forget this little agreement we have in time and let us do our own thing, what can they really do?"
 flavor_goblin_trading_company.7.a:0 "Dumb little fey"

 flavor_goblin_trading_company.8:0 "Eastern Pacts Set"
 flavor_goblin_trading_company.8.t:0 "Eastern Pacts Set"
 flavor_goblin_trading_company.8.d:0 "The eastern pacts are a little harder for the common goblin to stomach as you never know who will be targetted by such a pact. The children of future goblins will be targetted by the fey, some say its for their own enjoyment some say its for retribution of some past gripes. Regardless we will only listen to their little game for 10 years im sure their demands will die down by then"
 flavor_goblin_trading_company.8.a:0 "Dumb little fey"

 flavor_goblin_trading_company.9:0 "A New Future"
 flavor_goblin_trading_company.9.t:0 "A New Future"
 flavor_goblin_trading_company.9.d:0 "We have gone into the serpentspine, conquered the holds, enslaved the dwarves and gotten control of the mithril mines that we need for goblinsteel. Then we went into the deepwoods to get the feywood we need for the steel. Now we must decide what to do, either we continue the production of more companies in the serpentspine or we continue our production of goblinsteel to be made for the tanks"
 flavor_goblin_trading_company.9.a:0 "Expanding the companies will be most important"
 flavor_goblin_trading_company.9.b:0 "Goblinsteel for the armies will be most important"

 flavor_goblin_trading_company.10:0 "Reforging the Goblinsblade"
 flavor_goblin_trading_company.10.t:0 "Reforging the Goblinsblade"
 flavor_goblin_trading_company.10.d:0 "The goblinsblade of old was a bit of a stain on our reputation and brought pretty much every goblin down. We decided to go along this road of conquest for the rarest materials we could think of to make the new goblinsteel. While we didnt know then that it would actually be effective we know now. It has been a mainstay of our global presence and now it is time to recreate the Goblinsblade. The old design may be a bit old though so we are going to remake it for todays standards as well to show that we are not the nation of old but a new and well structured and powerful nation"
 flavor_goblin_trading_company.10.a:0 "Goblinsblade Reforged"

 flavor_goblin_trading_company.11:0 "Goblinsteel is normal steel?"
 flavor_goblin_trading_company.11.t:0 "Goblinsteel is normal steel?"
 flavor_goblin_trading_company.11.d:0 "There has been some devastating news. We have heard about normal steel but we didnt really know of the production methods. We were so focused on what that goblin did at the formation of our new country that we didnt even take the time to ask how to make the metals around us. Now it has been brought to our attention that our 'Goblinsteel' is just normal steel. We have become the laughingstock of the greater community and now we must suffer the consequences. But also a particularly smart goblin has brought to our attention that this doesnt have to be the end of it. We know of mithril in the mountains and the feywood in the deepwoods. What if we were to comine those? maybe nothing but it will be new and our own thing. Who knows maybe this will be a new material better than them all even if it is much too expensive to properly produce"
 flavor_goblin_trading_company.11.a:0 "It is time to go into the mountains"
 flavor_goblin_trading_company.11.b:0 "It is time to go into the deepwoods"
 
 flavor_goblin_trading_company.12:0 "The Fey Revolt!"
 flavor_goblin_trading_company.12.t:0 "The Fey Revolt!"
 flavor_goblin_trading_company.12.d:0 "Long have we been ignoring our deals with the fey and it appears that enough is enough. from every corner of the deepwoods there appears to be animals controlled by the fey hunting down goblins and destroying our tanks! They must be dealt with to continue production"
 flavor_goblin_trading_company.12.a:0 "Time to reign them in"

 flavor_goblin_trading_company.13:0 "Fey Revolt Cleared"
 flavor_goblin_trading_company.13.t:0 "Fey Revolt Cleared"
 flavor_goblin_trading_company.13.d:0 "After years of conflict the feys animals have been defeated and their picked servants wiped. The fey that remain have agreed to become subservient to us and we will not continue this bloodshed. They may still play their little pranks but they will have nowhere near the influence that they once had"
 flavor_goblin_trading_company.13.a:0 "What can we do with them now?"

 flavor_goblin_trading_company.14:0 "Archfey Servants Attack"
 flavor_goblin_trading_company.14.t:0 "Archfey Servants Attack"
 flavor_goblin_trading_company.14.d:0 "The Archfey have decided to get close to personally involved by sending in their picked servants. They will be considerably more difficult to deal with than anything else that we have faced so far."
 flavor_goblin_trading_company.14.a:0 "I guess its time to test them out"

 flavor_goblin_trading_company.15:0 "Fey Kidnap Soldiers"
 flavor_goblin_trading_company.15.t:0 "Fey Kidnap Soldiers"
 flavor_goblin_trading_company.15.d:0 "While they have been sieging down cities and burning our tanks the fey have made a sudden attack on our populations stealing them away forever."
 flavor_goblin_trading_company.15.a:0 "This shall not go unpunished"

 flavor_goblin_trading_company.16:0 "Fey Cause Unrest"
 flavor_goblin_trading_company.16.t:0 "Fey Cause Unrest"
 flavor_goblin_trading_company.16.d:0 "The fey have decided to cause unrest within our empire making it harder to control our lands. This shall be dealt with swiftly of course but drawing tanks away from the front lines will be bothersome"
 flavor_goblin_trading_company.16.a:0 "Just another trick of the fey"

 flavor_goblin_trading_company.17:0 "Sudden Fey Ambush"
 flavor_goblin_trading_company.17.t:0 "Sudden Fey Ambush"
 flavor_goblin_trading_company.17.d:0 "The fey have decided to suddenly attack us through the deepwoods. This small incursion will be dealt with swiftly and efficiently"
 flavor_goblin_trading_company.17.a:0 "Just a small distraction"

 z1z_showing_dominance_over_orcs_desc:0 "The orcs use to have dominance over us goblins, but now in escann we are free and we also have the tools to fight back. We are united and many while they are disunified and little in number. It is time to show our prowess"
 z1z_producing_materials_for_everyday_needs_title:0 "Producing Materials for Everyday Needs"
 z1z_producing_materials_for_everyday_needs_desc:0 "While the production of goblinsteel is the most important thing we can make there is no deniability that we do need other materials. We should make these so that our quality of life can increase enough that the common goblin doesnt complain about all our resources going into goblinsteel"
 z1z_finding_a_new_home_title:0 "Finding a New Home"
 z1z_finding_a_new_home_desc:0 "It is time to set up our base of operations. We are looking for a location with a large amount of iron that can be extracted so that we can make more goblinsteel efficiently"
 z1z_conquerors_of_escann_title:0 "Conquerors of Escann"
 z1z_conquerors_of_escann_desc:0 "The fight for escann has been particularly hectic as the borders change just about every month as new adventuring companies join rise and fall, but we are different. We have control over enough production and troops to hold our territory and now it is time to expand it and prove once and for all that we are the conquerors of escann"
 z1z_removing_the_old_patricians_title:0 "Removing the Old Patricians"
 z1z_removing_the_old_patricians_desc:0 "The patricians are the old caste of people in control of castonath. They were extremely influencial within the human communities and also extremely corrupt. As goblins we admire the corruption but at the same time this feels like an unnecessary hinderance to our expansion so it is within our best interests to fully remove the patricians from power"
 z1z_deciding_our_permenant_residence_title:0 "Deciding Our Permenant Residence"
 z1z_deciding_our_permenant_residence_desc:0 "Our roaming across escann moving from capital to capital is now over, we have control over the major city of castonath as well as control over the massive iron deposit of steelhyl and the ancient dwarven hold of marrhold. Any of these locations could be useful as a capital and it is up to you to decide which one is most benificial"
 z1z_forging_of_goblins_blade_title:0 "Forging of Goblins Blade"
 z1z_forging_of_goblins_blade_desc:0 "We have conquered our corner of escann and built up our production of goblinsteel. Then we have practiced the art over time to perfect it. Now it is time to show the world the fruits of our labour through making a sword to show off our skills and techniques. It will be the centerstone of our nation to show our place in the world stage."
 z1z_iron_deposits_needed_title:0 "Iron Deposits Needed"
 z1z_iron_deposits_needed_desc:0 "The first component of goblinsteel is of course the iron needed to produce the goblinsteel itself. So we should gather a good amount of it to try and replicate the process of the lazy goblin"
 z1z_increase_iron_production_title:0 "Increase Iron Production"
 z1z_increase_iron_production_desc:0 "Now that we have a decent amount of natural iron deposits we need to expand the production of these locations. Escann has long been ravaged by war and we need to rebuilt it back up from nothing"
 z1z_collecting_materials_together_title:0 "Collecting Materials Together"
 z1z_collecting_materials_together_desc:0 "While we dont mind working our orcish slaves to transport the materials of charcoal and iron from their production points to a forge to make the goblinsteel. But it would be much more efficient to have them procured in the same location so we should build up some forested areas with iron deposits to ensure that our supplied flow efficiently from now on"
 z1z_manufactories_producing_more_iron_title:0 "Manufactories Producing More Iron"
 z1z_manufactories_producing_more_iron_desc:0 "With the introduction of manufactories we need to take advantage of this production center immediately. With these buildings we will be able to build the first tanks that were planned by one of our founding goblins, a box of metal with a cannon on top."
 z1z_tearing_down_their_temples_title:0 "Tearing Down Their Temples"
 z1z_tearing_down_their_temples_desc:0 "We are in a new land that all follow their own gods. While we dont really care which gods they follow as they are all their own versions of our dieties the outright worship of them more so than ours must not happen to keep the stability of our realm. Removing such places will force them to work harder on our projects."

 z1z_all_under_one_religion_desc:0 "Everyone under our conquests must follow our gods at least nominally to keep cooperation within our nation"
 z1z_a_goblin_state_for_goblins_title:0 "A Goblin State For Goblins"
 z1z_a_goblin_state_for_goblins_desc:0 "While we dont really care about the others in our nation it is still important that us goblins are the major people within our borders. The other races can be in our country but we should never find them to be a majority within our nation"
 z1z_understanding_others_religions_title:0 "Understanding Others Religions"
 z1z_understanding_others_religions_desc:0 "Escann has now had multiple different religions all across the area. Learning of their religions has helped us in controlling this land and as such clearly we should learn about all the religions across halann. We will send goblin adventurers all across halann to learn about these different cults and bring them back to us to choose what would be the most useful cult to take advantage of"
 z1z_wood_to_burn_title:0 "Wood To Burn"
 z1z_wood_to_burn_desc:0 "The lazy goblin taught us that leaving the iron in a furnace for too long helps make goblinsteel, a name derived from other steel which means hardened iron. We don't know how others make it but ours is clearly superior. And to prove it, we have to copy the conditions that the lazy goblin did to make goblinsteel. And to do this, we need many trees to burn"
 z1z_colonizing_the_forests_title:0 "Colonizing the Forests"
 z1z_colonizing_the_forests_desc:0 "our conquests of escann leads us to having more and more different types of people and cultures within our realm but for the time being we cant have them know of our plans as we dont want another nation to steal our efforts and as such we need to keep majority control over most of the production process so to keep the amount of trees we are burning secret we should try to keep a majority within these lands"
 z1z_increasing_production_of_wooded_provinces_title:0 "Increasing Production of Wooded Provinces"
 z1z_increasing_production_of_wooded_provinces_desc:0 "We are now in control of enough wooded areas to keep production of goblinsteel high so we need to focus on expanding our production of these resources to keep the supply reliable"
 z1z_searching_for_more_iron_deposits_title:0 "Searching for More Iron Deposits"
 z1z_searching_for_more_iron_deposits_desc:0 "It is well known that there is more iron under our feet we just havent searched hard enough for them instead focusing on the treasures above the ground. It is time for us to now search under the recently cleared forests for the iron that we so desperately need"
 z1z_defending_the_walls_title:0 "Defending the Walls"
 z1z_defending_the_walls_desc:0 "The walls of castonor are a great natural defensive line that we should focus on expanding on. While we dont have the numbers to fully garrison such a large wall we can build strong points to defend and just work with that"
 z1z_expanding_our_control_in_escann_title:0 "Expanding Our Control in Escann"
 z1z_expanding_our_control_in_escann_desc:0 "While it is nice to own the provinces we do in escann we dont really control all the trade within it. We need to work on expanding the centers of trade to make our control more absolute as if we control the trade we control the region"
 z1z_ensuring_large_slave_supplies_title:0 "Ensuring Large Slave Supplies"
 z1z_ensuring_large_slave_supplies_desc:0 "The orcs were once the slavers of goblins after the dwarves were slavers of goblins, Now it is time to take our revenge. We always had a small amount of orcish slavery but now it is time for us to expand the practice on a national scale."
 z1z_slave_camps_starting_production_title:0 "Slave Camps Starting Production"
 z1z_slave_camps_starting_production_desc:0 "Now that we have a steady supply of slaves its time for them to work on our supplies. While we dont trust them working on goblinsteel we do trust them to work on everyday items as the quality of that is much easier to control. That way we keep our goblinsteel secret and ensure that it is always of the highest quality."
 z1z_an_entrenceway_into_the_mountains_title:0 "An Entrenceway Into the Mountains"
 z1z_an_entrenceway_into_the_mountains_desc:0 "The easiest way into the mountains is clearly by taking the dwarven roads, with the marrhold tunnel long destroyed it means the only real way into the mountains is through Khugdihr. Capturing this stronghold will allow our forces to easily and quickly enter the mountains and get to the mithril hold that is our objective"
 z1z_the_road_to_haraz_orldhum_title:0 "The Road to Haraz Orldhum"
 z1z_the_road_to_haraz_orldhum_desc:0 "The first hold along the way to the mithril hold is of course Haraz Orldhum. Securing the roads there will be our first objective before the taking of the hold itself. From there we can either focus on the main objective of the mithril hold or we can make our way to the rest of the dwarovar"
 z1z_the_gates_of_haraz_orldhum_title:0 "The Gates of Haraz Orldhum"
 z1z_the_gates_of_haraz_orldhum_desc:0 "Haraz Orldhum is not seen as a good place to goblins. It is the main hold that enslaved the goblins and sold them to anyone wanting them. Pretty much every goblin in the western serpentspine was put under their control and just about every escanni goblin has heard the tales of slavery from Haraz Orldhum before they were enslaved by the orcs."
 z1z_following_the_road_to_mithradhum_title:0 "Following the Road to Mithradhum"
 z1z_following_the_road_to_mithradhum_desc:0 "Finally our objective is in sight. The road to Mithradhum is the main way to the hold itself. Once we control that hold we will be able to get the mithril we need to create the new and improved goblinsteel"
 z1z_a_mithril_hold_title:0 "A Mithril Hold"
 z1z_a_mithril_hold_desc:0 "Finally we control the main supply of mithril in the dwarovar. The place is currently in ruins but after some fixing up we will be able to have a near infinite supply of mithril for goblinsteel"
 z1z_mithril_production_completed_title:0 "Mithril Production completed"

 z1z_connecting_fey_to_cannons_1_desc:0 "Now that the fey are properly subservient to us it is time that we put them to work like we did the orcs. We will install them into the cannons to make them a little more explosive and ease the crews a bit on reloading."
 z1z_securing_our_left_flank_1_title:0 "Securing Our Left Flank"
 z1z_securing_our_left_flank_1_desc:0 "It is time to continue our conquests of the deepwoods. The western deepwoods is mostly elves and goblins, Elves are weak and as such we will crush them easily. The goblins on the other hand have been here since the beginning and as such we will prove that leaving the fey is the correct choice or we will crush them under the wheels of our tanks"
 z1z_leftside_flank_secured_1_title:0 "Leftside Flank Secured"
 z1z_leftside_flank_secured_1_desc:0 "We have proven ourselves in the western deepwoods and now it is time to finish the job. The rest of the western deepwoods will be put under our control and we can then look to make pacts with the fey courts in the area to smooth our control over the area."
 z1z_western_deepwoods_pacts_set_1_title:0 "Western Deepwoods Pacts Set"
 z1z_western_deepwoods_pacts_set_1_desc:0 "The western deepwoods are now fully under our control as well as properly defended by our walls and troops. Now it is time to smooth the transition from them to us. The goblins arent too happy with making another pact but if we are to hold this land we must until we have a proper hold and can betray them easily."
 z1z_connecting_fey_to_engines_1_title:0 "Connecting Fey to Engines"
 z1z_connecting_fey_to_engines_1_desc:0 "The fey have long eluded us in battle. Their speed is considerable in the deep forests that it was hard to keep up with them. As such we will make them control our engines as a sort of punishment. This will allow it to run more efficiently than before as well as lower the manpower required to use our tanks"
 z1z_heading_towards_the_mountain_1_title:0 "Heading Towards the Mountain"
 z1z_heading_towards_the_mountain_1_desc:0 "The mountains are our natural habitat. Perhaps that is why we are always drawn to them, but they seem different now. From the direction of the deepwoods the mountain looks somehow more imposing as the impossibly large trees are dwarfed by the massive mountainrange infront of us. The mountains are a natural barrier but are also where the orcs flew down the mountains to invade the deepwoods and now it is up to us to clean up this mess."
 z1z_full_mountainside_control_1_title:0 "Full Mountainside Control"
 z1z_full_mountainside_control_1_desc:0 "We have control over most of the deepwoods now. The orcs are either defeated or in hiding around the serpentsreach. As necessary as it is to remove the orcs from the deepwoods it also comes with a sort of liberating feel as while the deepwoods isnt our homeland it is the homeland to a large number of goblins and in a way this is a victory for goblins over the orcs where in the past there were none."
 z1z_eastern_deepwoods_pacts_1_title:0 "Eastern Deepwoods Pacts"
 z1z_eastern_deepwoods_pacts_desc_1:0 "The eastern deepwoods seems to have a completely different feel to it than the western. The fey here seem to be more aggressive, more bloodthirsty and we worry about what the price will be to pay for their allowances of us being here. It will be paid of course if only for a few years where we fully control the deepwoods and can properly do what we wish. In the meantime though it is a terrifying thought of the greater costs to us for these conquests."
 z1z_connecting_fey_to_chassis_title_1:0 "Connecting the Fey to Chassis"
 z1z_connecting_fey_to_chassis_desc_1:0 "The chassis of the tank is perhaps the most important part. While all the other stuff is important the original idea of the tank was to allow our goblins to do what they wanted freely in battle and have them be protected. Having the fey enchant and work on the chassis will give them just a little more surivability that will make the dream seem much more real."
 z1z_defending_the_eastern_flank_1_title:0 "Defending the Eastern Flank"
 z1z_defending_the_eastern_flank_1_desc:0 "The mountains are well known for their treacherous caverns and near endless hallways, the deepwoods are about the same in feel. Endless directions and treacherous animals. However the deepwoods have only a few enterances while the mountains have many and as such we will be defending the deepwoods poriton of the border."
 z1z_implementing_production_facilities_1_title:0 "Implementing Production Facilities"
 z1z_implementing_production_facilities_1_desc:0 "Now that the mountainside is protected we can start focusing on producing as much fey wood as we can as the eastern part of the deepwoods seems to be much more abundant in it"
 z1z_connecting_fey_to_tracks_1_title:0 "Connecting the Fey to Tracks"
 z1z_connecting_fey_to_tracks_1_desc:0 "Now that we have control over the fey we can make a good use for them in our tanks. The roughest part of the tank is dealing with terrain as any damage can hamper and slow the tanks advance. However, with the fey enchanting the tracks and ensuring any damage doesnt effect them then every tank effected will be able to operate as efficiently as possible"

 z1z_starting_the_petition_title:0 "Starting the Petition"
 z1z_starting_the_petition_desc:0 "We have decided to expand the non state owned factories to enable more and more different types of tanks. They have thus far proven to be extremely efficient in combat so it is important to see what it is that each facility can do. The different holds will send a petition to the government about their hold and what they can do as well as their output capabilities. These will then be reviewed and then accepted or denied."
 z1z_building_up_holds_for_specialization_title:0 "Building Up Holds For Specialization"
 z1z_building_up_holds_for_specialization_desc:0 "Now that we know what each hold is capable of it is time for us to expand each and every one of them until they can all produce a good enough amount of mercenaries to help us"
 z1z_learning_old_metal_forging_title:0 "Learning Old Metal Forging"
 z1z_learning_old_metal_forging_desc:0 "The basic types of tanks that were submitted are either complete or on the way but in the meantime theres 2 holds with special metals that we dont really know how to make or use. Dagrite and Ramsteel. We will need to work with what the metal looks like, how it reacts to stuff, and our own inginuity to figure out how to recreate these metals"
 z1z_reforging_goblinsblade_title:0 "Reforging Goblinsblade"
 z1z_reforging_goblinsblade_desc:0 "It is time to reforge goblinsblade. We know how to make goblinsteel and depending on how it is that we decided to guide our empire we can produce it and we can now show the world what we can do. Goblinsteel is made with the magics of the fey in the feywood as well as them helping in the process of smelting the mithril found in the mountains. It is a very expensive and impractical refining process not really drawing out that much extra strength for the work done to create it but it is undoubtably ours and as such we should recreate the blade that disgraced us all those years ago anew and more powerful than ever."
 z1z_khugdihr_golem_tanks_title:0 "Khugdihr Golem Tanks"
 z1z_khugdihr_golem_tanks_desc:0 "The Khugdihr golem tanks were thought up as the nearby hold use to be the hold that created golems. With some ingenuity we have learned how to recreate them and while they wouldnt perform well compared to our tanks they can be on top of them perhaps and provide some melee protetion?"
 z1z_orlaz_slave_tanks_title:0 "Orlaz Slave Tanks"
 z1z_orlaz_slave_tanks_desc:0 "The Orlaz Slave Tank is basically just a tank made through slave labour. They are defective, slow, fall apart, and are overall very low quality compared to any of their competitors but there are so many of them that it wont even matter. Even if only half of them can fire they will still have more firepower than any of the other manufactories tanks."
 z1z_repair_tanks_title:0 "Repair Tanks"
 z1z_repair_tanks_desc:0 "Dagrite is the resource that is used for the rails. It can repair itself when an electrical current runs through it but it wont be as effective as our current tanks. Therefore these tahnks can be used to take some damage, deal some damage and then after the battle they fall back and repair themselves completely before being able to come back into the frey."
 z1z_bureaucratic_tanks_title:0 "Bureaucratic Tanks"
 z1z_bureaucratic_tanks_desc:0 "We know that not all of our vehicles have to be effective in battle and that is exactly what the plans are for these tanks. They will be able to oversee and build up this nation or just keep it running more efficiently."
 z1z_ramsteel_tanks_title:0 "Ramsteel Tanks"
 z1z_ramsteel_tanks_desc:0 "We arent really sure why the ramsteel ends up a bit stronger than normal steel but we will accept it none the less. Instead having these ramsteel tanks will be a slight boon to our army even if we cannot make as many of them as we would like as taming of the rams has been a slow and arduous process, but the slight extra strength of the steel will hopefully be better."
 z1z_science_tanks_title:0 "Science Tanks"
 z1z_science_tanks_desc:0 "While many of the other holds focus on their steels this one instead focuses on one thing and one thing only, firepower. The other goblins called this place cursed and chose to never control this place but not us, we have instead decided to not only control but tame and learn from the past habitants. We just also take their warnings to heart and dont use the cursed telescope in the observatory."
 z1z_one_final_agreement_title:0 "One Final Agreement"
 z1z_one_final_agreement_desc:0 "The fey have been completely dealt with. We allow them to work in our tanks and in response we give them little to nothing. The war against them in the deepwoods shows that they cannot rebel against us without heavy losses and it is instead better to just work with us and hope that someone else will bail them out of here. It will of course never happen but we ensure that they always feel hopeful enough to not try anyhthing."
 z1z_working_the_mages_in_the_deepwoods_title:0 "Working the Mages in the Deepwoods"
 z1z_working_the_mages_in_the_deepwoods_desc:0 "The mages have been the forefront of fey relations. They are the most capable of talking with them as training to be a mage in the deepwoods requires knowing how to talk to the fey. While they are under our control you still do have to be careful around them, that was the mistakes of the fey revolt when we finished conquering the deepwoods."
 z1z_increasing_production_numbers_title:0 "Increasing Production Numbers"
 z1z_increasing_production_numbers_desc:0 "Now that we can produce a proper amount of goblinsteel it is important that we translate that into our goblinsteel tanks to show our might. By making enough of them to cover two fronts in a war semi effectively it will show the world that goblinsteel isnt just some small trick it is a proper alloy that they should fear."
 z1z_goblinsteel_cannons_title:0 "Goblinsteel Cannons"
 z1z_goblinsteel_cannons_desc:0 "Goblinsteel is a very interesting resource. Completely impractical and yet it is somehow able to boost the strength of its cannons. Whether its through the larger payload of gunpowder allowed by its strength or the boost from the fey magic it doesnt matter fey cannons are just more damaging."
 z1z_goblinsteel_engines_title:0 "Goblinsteel Engines"
 z1z_goblinsteel_engines_desc:0 "The engine is probably the most difficult part of the tank to get right. It burns through coal or charcoal to be able to move but each small mechanism inside of it is so important that any imperfections can cause failure. This is why no slaves ever touch this part and now that we are using Goblinsteel its even more important that its only made by goblins. The actual effect of using goblinsteel here though is a little harder to quantify"
 z1z_heavy_mithril_mining_innovations_title:0 "Heavy Mithril Mining Innovations"
 z1z_heavy_mithril_mining_innovations_desc:0 "Mithril mining is extremely difficult as its such a rare resource. However after years of mining and perfecting the art we have learned of better mining techniques to get the rare resource and as such the price of Goblinsteel should go down to create."
 z1z_goblinsteel_chassis_title:0 "Goblinsteel Chassis"
 z1z_goblinsteel_chassis_desc:0 "The outside of the tank is extremely important but also the most expensive part to replace. Goblinsteel as an alloy is extremely difficult to create but when the outer layer of the tank is made out of it there is some small regenerative capabilities when the tank takes damage as well as just being harder to damage in general."
 z1z_heavy_feywood_cutting_innovations_title:0 "Heavy Feywood Cutting Innovations"
 z1z_heavy_feywood_cutting_innovations_desc:0 "While feywood is kind of everywhere the manufactoring of turning it from feywood into feycoal is tedious and time consuming. Therefore the innovations to how to properly procure feywood to allow for easier burning as well as better techniques to get more feycoal per time invested has made it significantly easier for us to make Goblinsteel"
 z1z_goblinsteel_tracks_title:0 "Goblinsteel Tracks"
 z1z_goblinsteel_tracks_desc:0 "The tracks of the tanks have always been super important. The general all purpose tracks were made so that it could go through most terrain without much of an issue but damage from constant use is a problem and having enough engineers to keep up repairs is expensive and the fey are already overworked they cant deal with every issue we bring to them. So using Goblinsteel in the tracks should allow us to get some of the regenerative properties of Goblinsteel into the tracks and allow for repairs to be even easier on our logistics."

First it is not a trading company, not in the slightest. They decided upon the name when they realized that places with the name trading company tended to make money so therefore we should name it ourselves. Second is the invention of steel. Goblins have spent their lives being slaves and fodder that they havent really had the time to integrate everything from their surroundings all at once and that includes steel production. So when they create steel themselves they think it is a new resource. Surely this will not have any consequences."
