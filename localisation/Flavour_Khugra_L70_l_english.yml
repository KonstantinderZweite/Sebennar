    flavour_khugra.1.d:0 "The city of Khugra never knew independence, despite its strategically important location and long history. A major port within the Karasskas Empire, Khugra was one of the few cities that stayed loyal to Karassk during its collapse in the 8th century. In its rump state, plagued by turmoil and misfortune, Karassk eventually lost its ability to protect Khugra from external threats. When the Shagadyrra tribe besieged Khugra in 1389, Karassk did not answer the city's calls for help, leaving its people to their fate, and marking the start of Khugra’s history as an independent Ikatara.\n\nKhugra managed to negotiate peace with the tribe, accepting them as equals and employing them in the army. A few years later however, the ambitious Raktaya Teran of Nazhni blockaded the city, defeating their young fleet at sea. Khugra had to accept a humiliating peace agreement, selling entire districts of the city to Nazhnas traders.\n\nThe Shagadyrra tribes quickly integrated into Khugra's society. However, after Sykar Riverclaw defeated the Anzara empire and seized the city of Zerat, many tribesmen shifted their loyalties, and now wish to secede to Rayaz and enter the service of the chosen of the naga. Others prefer his brother Katyradz Riverclaw, who has recently taken the city of Ashuzal and is now in a bid to defeat the dying Karassk. If he succeeds in his mission, many in Khugra would be willing to overthrow the state to join his cause.\n\nKhugra's problems are numerous, and many in the realm believe pledging loyalty to one of these powerful states may be the only way to keep the city and its people safe. Should we side with Rayaz, Asarta, or Nahzni? Or should we shun them all and stay independent against all the odds? Only time will tell if we will manage to keep control over the state, or if Khugra’s independence will be as fleeting as a footprint on the shore, washed away by relentless tides."

Alternatively, you can try to overcome the challenges by fully destroying the enemies of Khugra."

Our officials hoped that this would mean the collapse of the Red Party, but they have been disappointed. The traitors have been quick to switch their allegiance away from the would-be-conquerors and towards the successful defenders.

They have received support from remains of the other two parties that escaped prosecution after being crushed. Treacherous priests exalt the peasantry against us, traitor generals push our own soldiers to betray their motherland, and greedy merchants seduce the hearts of many in our government with their blood-soaked coin. This last stand does nothing but show how deep the corruption that tainted Khugra was. Like a wretched cancer that desperately tries to cling to the finally healing body.

Perhaps they were right with one thing, indeed, might must make right, as we have thoroughly proved to be mightier than them and their supporters. There is no question that their leaders will be executed, their sins against Khugra too heavy to consider the possibility of forgiveness.\n\nHowever, many of their lower status members have requested a pardon, claiming they held the sincere belief that Khugra could not survive on their own, and that they now clearly see they were terribly mistaken. They promise the Sapphire Loyalty can count with their lifelong service and loyalty if we show mercy. It is true that these talented generals could be a great asset for our armies, as among them are some of the greatest military minds of lizardkind.

There is no question that their leaders will be executed, their sins against Khugra too heavy to consider the possibility of forgiveness.\n\nHowever, many former members of this Party have requested forgiveness, claiming they were misled and deceived by the promises of their leaders. They are ready to swear undying loyalty to the Sapphire Party if we choose to spare their lives and preserve their status. Among them are some of the brighter religious minds of a generation, Naga most wise in matters of both magic and faith. They could surely serve the state greatly if spared, but many in our government are claiming for their execution. They believe a matter of such importance as the spiritual health of Khugra cannot be entrusted to traitors, and we should replace them with loyalists.

These merchants sold their homeland for vain riches, but all their gold and wealth could not save them from the righteous fury of the Sapphire Party. As they betrayed Khugra for coin, they should be reviled even more than the already shameful betrayers of the Red and Green Party, who at least could swear to be committing the heinous treason for ideas or faith. We poured molten gold down the throats of their leaders, who drowned and burned with the same metal they so avariciously coveted.\n\nThere are however some among their lower ranks who could perhaps be treated more mercifully. They claim they are truly repentant from their acts, and promise us eternal loyalty in exchange for a pardon. Indeed their naval expertise could come to great use for our state, and surely our trade would benefit from counting with them. Some among us, however, are still certain that their acts are unforgivable, and demand they receive the same treatment as the higher leadership."

That Khugra was destined to be nothing but a part of greater empires, a minor city, always loyal to whatever conqueror had seized it at any given time. But we stood in the face of adversity. When the Shagadyrra tribe sieged the Sapphire City again and again, our walls and our men stood strong. We made our enemies our brothers, and united the two peoples under the Sapphire flag. When brutal conquerors in the west, greedy merchants in the east and self-aggrandizing zealots in the north funded legions of traitors among our citizens, and tried to tear down the Sapphire using them as puppets, we stood strong, and we pushed back.\n\nAnd now it is finally time to put down shields and spears, time for our warriors to get their much deserved rest, time to celebrate and rejoice. Because we have triumphed! The traitors have been crushed, the oppressors subjugated, conquerors shattered in the field of battle, fleets sunk in the oceans by our own ships, aspirants torn down from their towers of lies! The Sapphire Party now stands proud and strong, wisely guiding and advising our monarch, who leads the greatest of the many realms in Taneyas! Khugra United, Khugra Eternal, Khugra Free!"

To most, it would seem like just another night in the beautiful shores of Khugra, but for the citizens of the Sapphire City, it is much, much more. As hundreds and hundreds of lizardfolk approach the waters, none speaks a word. They carry with them offerings of all kinds. The richest have brought beautiful jewels and trinkets, foods most exquisite and expertly woven clothes. But even the poorest beggar in the city has mustered their few possessions to bring something they value to the festival, and they know that the waves will treasure and reward all offerings the same.\n\nAs the constellation of Yusshela shines brightly in the skies, with the outline of the Celestial Dolphin clearly visible, the hundreds of attendants slowly enter the waters and carefully place their offerings under the waves.\n\nAnd as the greatest Festival of the Favoured Waves that history remembers is celebrated, a fair compensation for our shameful neglect of our bond during the years of war, dozens of shining silhouettes are spotted dancing and spinning, moving among the winds and waves. Dolphins, serpents, fishes, whales, and myriad other forms, constantly shifting and transforming.

We found the first natives, who call themselves the Oono'i, to be famished and tormented people. At first they seemed quite terrified of our appearance, but soon we were able to show our peaceful intent and eventually break the language barrier. They told us that the reason for their suffering is a vile and powerful entity that inhabits this continent, a sort of sentient and malicious jungle. The Oono’i tried to defend themselves from this demon by burning it, containing its spread, and in response it launched a genocidal campaign against them, turning thousands of their people into Seedthralls, puppeteered corpses infested with vines and roots.\n\nTheir plight is very tragic, but for us, it is a great opportunity! Being in such a desperate situation, they are not only willing but eager to collaborate with our colonists and explorers. We will guarantee their safety from the jungle and provide them with the resources they need to survive, and in exchange they will assist with our colonisation of the region. Some of them have even asked to be allowed to travel to Taneyas in our returning ships. We cannot blame them, as at least in Sarhal jungles do not usually try to murder us so relentlessly."

This was not the case. The Taychendi are, according to the reports we have received and the contacts we have bought in their cities, a chaotic, war-torn civilization. The warlords that rule them periodically kill each other in an effort to forge empires that will promptly crumble like sand, ravaging the land and killing thousands in the process.\n\nA society as brutal as this one has earned many enemies, but sadly they seem to all be almost as bad as the status quo. From fanatic and violent abolitionists, to oppressive and intolerant blue-skinned elves from the east, and even zealots coming from the distands lands of Bulwar. As if this was not enough, it seems like many of them despise lizardfolk due to a clearly coincidental similarity with the antagonists of some of their old legends. Some have even come as far as to claim their ancestors reduced our ancient empires to ashes, a claim most ridiculous and pathetic.\n\nThey are indeed supremely lucky that we have arrived, as their civilization would be doomed to destruction otherwise. We will crush their petty realms, root out their violent and self-destructive religion, execute their warlords and place their people under our administration.

In the markets of Khugra, goods from all corners of the world are sold and bought. Peoples from all continents and of all races walk through our streets, be it as visitors, merchants or citizens. Hundreds of ships arrive to and depart from our ports daily, bringing goods, people, knowledge and more from all around Halann. The Araizary presence is felt everywhere along our shores, in the breeze and the waves, blessing our people as they have done for generations and generations.\n\nThe rule of the Sapphire is felt way beyond Taneyas too, in the bustling cities of Taychend, finally peaceful and free after generations of oppression and war. In the Summer Islands, where even the poorest beggar seasons his food with spices that the richest in Cannor cannot dream to afford. In Ardimya, where a long lost civilization rises again under our benevolent rule. IIn the distant Ringlet Islands, where men live in harmony with spirits as we do with the Araizary. And in many, many more places, where the Sapphire Party has brought prosperity, riches, happiness and joy without end.\n\nThis might seem like a happy ending for our story, but in reality, it is just the beginning, the start of a song which will continue for all eternity, the song of Khugra, Blessed Khugra, Khugra United, Khugra Eternal, Khugra Prosperous, Khugra Free, now and forever."

We soon found out that this was not a malicious act by the Araizary, as after a brief talk with them it became clear the city to which they wished to return was razed by hostile conquerors years ago.

It spoke in a soft tone and with a peculiar, archaic accent.\n\n"We do not usually speak like this with mortalkind, not since ages past, but your people have proved to be true friends of my kin." Before our ruler could thank the Araizary for its words, it continued. "Millenia ago, we and your people shared a goal. But eventually, another faith distracted your minds, you followed the path marked by our sisters in the stars, and our Journeys across the seas ceased to be a priority. We did not blame you, your fate is yours to decide. However, when your people restored our ties, stronger now than ever, the hope of a return to those days entered the minds of my kin. And now your ships sail farther, no corner beyond our reach. It is time, we could find her, if you help."\n\n"Find who?" [Root.Monarch.GetName] asked, and the spirit passionately replied. "The Mother of the Seas, our mother, and yours too, the slumbering Naga-Katesh. She rests hidden somewhere in these oceans, and our two peoples sought her together once.. Will we be united in our quest once again?" Seeing the smile of [Root.Monarch.GetName], the divine spirit knew the answer before [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] could speak, and in a way, it smiled too."

They have found and battled terrible beasts, from krakens to aboleths, they have discovered long lost relics, treasures and ruins, they have talked with Nereids, merfolk, Sea Elves, and all kinds of peoples of the seas. They have done that guided by the Araizary, and together we have surpassed every obstacle, defeated every threat, followed every clue.\n\nAnd yet, She is still not here. Despite all our efforts, despite all the sacrifices and investments in this sacred goal, we are no closer to finding Her than when we started. The Araizary are eternal, and so are their hopes and determination, they will never tire of searching for their Mother. They know, however, that we are still mortals despite the strength of our bonds, they could never ask us to dedicate our entire lives to a search that might very well never give fruit.\n\nToday, in the shores of Khugra, countless riches and relics emerged from the waves, a grand gift of the Araizary for our tireless efforts. And with them, they bring a message. Their hope is undying, they tell us, but this does not mean they cannot see reality. The Goddess does not want to be found yet, the time has not yet arrived.
