One weak ruler might shatter all the works of his illustrious forefathers and bring ruin to his people. But not glorious Karqašlu! We are blessed with an eternal Akalunakal - an Emperor Evermore! The strong hands, keen mind and wise heart of Alušir will forevermore guide us into a resplendent future, no matter whose face he happens to wear and with whose voice he announces his commands"

 F30_sunriders_ride_title:0 "Sunriders ride for Us"
 F30_sunriders_ride_desc:0 "The practice of magic has been the birthright of the Bulwari ever since the Šedu sultans had been bound by Brasan the Emancipator and his disciples. However, since the prohibition on the use of magic by humans enacted by the Phoenix empress Jexis the myriad proud traditions of Bulwari magic have been either secluded like the Wishcrafters of Mount Lazzaward, heavily regulated and under the control of the temples like the Exorcist-priests, adopted by elven magicians or forced underground like the szal-Fazil of the far Salahad and Dartaxâgerdim. One of these traditions are the Sarraka or Sunriders, mounted warrior mages originating from Kumarkand who once fought for Jaher even in far Haless. Now composed of elven mages sent as reinforcements from the Varamhari court with a talent for magic and a passion for horse riding, they currently are little more than a ceremonial honour guard for local nobility. Let us approach them in secret and persuade them to switch allegiance from the Varamhari, who treat them as little more than entertaining relics of a past era, to their new homeland and to support our cause instead in return for the restoration of their honourable role as Kumarkands defenders."
 
 F30_rumour_spiral_title:0 "Rumour Spiral"
 F30_rumour_spiral_desc:0 "Lately the rumours swirling in the streets of Apaškumar are even more colourful than usual and travel with an even more frenzied speed. \n\n ‘The Akal is planning to march on Varamhar on the morrow!’ \n\n ‘The Akal is a spineless fool who wants to hand over the throne to Karodir!’ \n\n The usually steady pulse of the city has reached a fever pitch. And in this climate of rumours and distrust comes a summons for the Akal to present himself before the throne of Varamhar. Will he navigate these treacherous waters safely or will this invitation be the spark that ignites the powder keg of rebellion?"
 
 F30_harpy_skies_title:0 "Eyes on the Skies"
 F30_harpy_skies_desc:0 "Since time immemorial, our people have been forced to keep a watchful eye out for the winged threat from the north. It is our duty to not only guard our borders and keep our people safe but to deal with this threat permanently. Whether with open hands and pleasing words or a hidden dagger and cunning ploys, we will pacify the lands of Ayarallen."
 
 F30_acesening_heights_title:0 "Ascending the Heights"
 F30_acesening_heights_desc:0 "If history has taught us anything it is not enough to merely keep the darkness at bay but to fight back and bring the light to dark places. To ensure lasting peace and secure our lands the strength of the harpy matriarchs has to be broken. It is our duty to free our Gelkali brethren from the yoke of winged tyrants. Let us march forward and bring Surakels light even to the most remote mountain vale."
 
 F30_kings_and_feathers_title:0 "Valleys of Kings and Feathers"
 F30_kings_and_feathers_desc:0 "Over two and a half millennia ago Batur III, the last valiant heir of ancient Karqašlu, lost his life in these craggy hills and deep valleys battling the rising might of the harpy queens. Now he is finally avenged! Kumarkand has been victorious and the feathered queens bow before the throne of our Akal."
 
 F30_winged_bulwari_title:0 "Winged Bulwari"
 F30_winged_bulwari_desc:0 "Harpies, one of the scourges of ancient Bulwar that sparked terror in the hearts of lonely travellers and shepherds have at long last become just one more colourful thread in the rich fabric of bulwari society. And like their winged inhabitants, the rugged former realm of the harpy queens is now part of Surakels garden and prospers under the benevolent rule of our Akal."
 
 F30_eyes_moons_title:0 "Eyes on the Moons"
 F30_eyes_moons_desc:0 "After we have turned the former queendoms of the harpies from a constant threat on our northern border to loyal vassals of our realm, it was only natural to turn our gaze to the remaining uplands to our north. Be it by force of arms or eloquent diplomacy, the inhabitants of these lands, be they harpy, human, elf or goblin, have at last become subjects of our glorious Akalate. Now we need to ensure that these remote provinces remain firmly in our grasp. Let us establish a border guard in the Šad Kuz, the mountains of the moon, to ensure that any spark of rebellion is swiftly snuffed out."
 
 F30_ituqattar_resplendent_title:0 "Ituqattar Resplendent"
 F30_ituqattar_resplendent_desc:0 "The culling of the Ituqattar is but a distant memory now, and our proud charioteers are once again at the vanguard of our armies and inspire awe in the hearts of our subjects in all corners of the empire. Recent reports from our new holdings in Bahar tell of elephant herds roaming through the forested hills. This has caught the attention of our glorious Akalunakal who has come up with an ambitious plan. Massive war chariot platforms drawn not by horses but by elephants! Enormous training facilities and housing for the animals will of course have to be built, but with the resources of an empire at hand this is a simple matter of logistics. The Ituqattar are ready to enter a new age of glory - let them strike fear in the hearts of our enemies! Let the resplendent Ituqattar advance!"
 
 F30_talk_whispers_title:0 "Talk and Whispers"
 F30_talk_whispers_desc:0 "The palace in Apaškumar has seen a steady stream of visitors, from provincial nobles to influential merchants and foreign dignitaries in the last couple of months. While palace officials assure everyone that this is merely business as usual and a sign of our beloved Akal fulfilling the duties entrusted to him by our benevolent overlords in Varamhar, the whispers will not stop that maybe he is not that enamoured with the reality of being subservient to another ruler and might plan to do something about it."
 
 F30_wise_king_title:0 "Wise King"
 F30_wise_king_desc:0 "Taelarios Irrliazuir is a steadfast ruler and one of the most influential theologians of the Sun Cult, seen by many as the ultimate arbiter in matters of faith. A ruler blessed with such wisdom will surely see the injustice in the subjugation of Kumarkand under the heel of the vainglorious Varamhari. We might discreetly try to approach him and petition him to support our struggle for independence. And once we have shaken off the yoke of our overlords, who would begrudge Irrliam the gift of a part of our surplus harvest which otherwise would have vanished as tribute down the voracious maw of Varamhar."
 
 F30_manor_lords_title:0 "Manor Lords"
 F30_manor_lords_desc:0 "While the elven Ralkadezim lords of Sareyand in their palatial country estates are just as haughty and overbearing as our Varamhari overlords, they have the distinct benefit of being suitably distracted by threats gnollish and otherwise arising from the deserts in the south and east. Even if they would be tempted to replace our current masters, they simply lack the means, at least for the moment. Therefore it might be in our best interests to swallow our pride for a while and appeal to their inflated sense of importance in return for the palpable benefits that Sareyandi patronage would mean for our troops."
 
 F30_marching_coin_title:0 "Marching for Coin"
 F30_marching_coin_desc:0 "Many heroic tales and epic hymns have been written that praise the loyalty of warriors and their willingness to fight even to their death for Akal and country. But as any cunning ruler can confirm, an army marches on its stomach and while undying loyalty should be treasured, it is a rare commodity indeed, and an acceptable facsimile can be purchased with enough coin. Let us gather the most promising rangers, sellswords and hirelings in our lands in a mercenary army to bolster our forces and deny our enemies the opportunity to purchase their services instead."
 
 F30_greater_kumarkand_title:0 "Greater Kumarkand"
 F30_greater_kumarkand_desc:0 "Kumarkand, not Bulwar or Irrliam, is the true heart of the fertile plains between Suran and Buranun. Let us proclaim a greater Kumarkand, a fitting homeland for our valiant people! Let even the lowest of peasants take pride in the knowledge that in his veins runs the blood of mighty conquerors and wise rulers!"
 
 F30_middle_brother_title:0 "Middle Brother"
 F30_middle_brother_desc:0 "Just as Apaškumar was founded by the Qašnitu of old and Arašbar has been erected by the ancient Akalites, so too does Anzabad bear the distinction of being founded by another group of nomadic invaders, the sea people or Abadi, who came to these lands only to find the shores of the Divenhal bereft of inhabitants after the ordeal of the Onslaught and ripe for resettling. Therefore many call Anzabad the Middle Brother to Kumarkands Older and Arašbars Younger Brother. It is only fitting that we turn our Middle Brother into one of our principal sea ports, now that Anzabad is ours."
 
 F30_city_desire_title:0 "City of Our Desire"
 F30_city_desire_desc:0 "Oh Brasan! The Eternal Home, Bazaar of Halann, Port of Emperors! Many have desired to claim you for their own over the millenia, but you are now the gleaming pearl in the crown of Kumarkand! Every Kumarkandi child has grown up with the tale of how the mighty Karqašlu empire conquered Brasan and put an end to the god king on his coral throne, only to lose this prize due to Elikhet’s treachery. Brasan is truly the City of Our Desire as it was called in the old tales, and now that it is ours, we will slake our desire and enjoy the luxuries brought by ships from a hundred nations to our shores."
 
 F30_sadnatu_riches_title:0 "Sadnatu Riches"
 F30_sadnatu_riches_desc:0 "The forbidding sight of the austere mountains of the sun rising up from the barren shore along the far eastern end of the Divenhal has deceived many visitors into believing that nothing of value could be found in its steep canyons and jagged heights. But as both the human Šadnatu who inhabit their unforgiving homeland at the border to the sunburnt Salahad since time immemorial and the gnollish invaders that plague these lands can attest, the wealth of the Šad Sur lies not in fertile fields and rich pastures above ground, but in the immense mineral wealth below its ochre surface. As we are now in control of these mountains let us make sure that these riches are no longer untapped but instead flow into our coffers."
 
 F30_rangers_armies_title:0 "Rangers Armies"
 F30_rangers_armies_desc:0 "The mercenary Sahiru have been an integral part of our military ever since our fight for independence. While they might in principle be hirelings, they have served Kumarkand exclusively for several decades now and have learned to operate in lockstep with our regular troops. This is an advantage we would be foolish to give up. It is long overdue to formalise this relationship and bind them even closer to our state. We shall create entire armies manned with our Rangers and bound to service the glory of Kumarkand with ironclad contracts."
 
 F30_back_bahar_title:0 "Back to Bahar"
 F30_back_bahar_desc:0 "Our realm stretches now from the source of the Suran to the westernmost tip of Bahar, from the mountains of the sun to the northernmost Harpy valley. Truly all of Surakels Garden is now part of Karqašlu. The western Bahari have by now accepted their new role as subjects of our magnanimous Akalunakal, even though some of their functionaries seem to leave confused after an audience and have been overheard to discuss amongst themselves whether some of the towns the Akalunakal talked about have not been buried by the sea since the great flood. The Bahari have turned their considerable efforts towards improving their homelands and endeavour to turn them into shining jewels in the Akalunakals crown to rival even the flourishing heartland."
 
 F30_calling_deep_title:0 "Calling the Deep"
 F30_calling_deep_desc:0 "A wise ruler does not wait for the enemy to carry out their plans but instead meets them on his own terms.” \n\n This at least is the reasoning heard from palace officials when asked about the purpose for the defence fortifications both mundane and magical erected all along the shore of the Divenhal. Who exactly that enemy is supposed to be is however not explained. Coincidentally many of the most promising mages of the empire have sequestered themselves with the Akalunakal to prepare for some great working, but what exactly the intent behind this ritual of immense proportions is remains to be seen. All along the shores of our empire a chilling sense of unease begins to grip the inhabitants of our coastal towns and villages."
 
 F30_tranquil_shores_title:0 "Tranquil Shores"
 F30_tranquil_shores_desc:0 "The idea is initially met with disbelief by many but it seems increasingly likely that the crest of the rogue wave has broken and Karqašlu is still left standing. The seemingly unending onslaught on our shores appears to have stopped after the final overwhelming rush of nightmarish creatures from the depths. Many have paid the ultimate price but it seems that this time around the Deep Devils have failed in extinguishing the light along Bulwars shores. The whole country awaits a proclamation from the palace with bated breath whether we should prepare for another desperate effort to hold back the forces of darkness or whether the Second Onslaught is finally over and it is time to mourn our losses and celebrate the victory of light."

 F30_younger_brother_title:0 "The Younger Brother"
 F30_younger_brother_desc:0 "Just like our distant ancestors the Qašnitu, who founded the mighty Karqašlu empire, were born from the union of ancient Bulwari and the nomadic Gigiru entering Surakels Garden from the distant lands beyond the Serpentspine, so are the Akalšesi of today the heirs of both sedentary Bulwari Nazites and Akalite nomads and therefore our younger brothers. We do not only share a glorious past but also a current inglorious fate as subservient vassals of the Varamhari. Let us appeal to our brethren in Arašbar to rise up with us to strike against our oppressors and reclaim our rightful place."
 
 F30_just_cause_title:0 "Cause Juste"
 F30_just_cause_desc:0 "All our hard efforts, our constant vigilance and cunning subterfuge has finally paid of - we are not only ready to strike at a moment's notice but thanks to a stroke of luck one of our agents in the court of Varamhar has provided us with a remarkable piece of intelligence. It appears as if the highest echelons of Varamhari administration including Kalodir himself, have been involved in a blasphemous endeavour of breathtaking scope. Their heretical so-called ‘Project Divinity’ appears to be an attempt to employ dangerous magics to turn a mortal into some sort of false god. If we were to propagate news of this discovery to our neighbours and use it as a pretext for our rebellion, even other elven realms would be disinclined to come to the aid of our overlord. The time to strike is now!"
 
 F30_kumarkandi_dawn_title:0 "Kumarkandi Dawn"
 F30_kumarkandi_dawn_desc:0 "It is done! We have struck down the conceited Varamhari who thought to keep us in chains, us, the heirs of Karqašlu and rightful rulers of Bulwar! They shall be forced to recognize the enormity of their error and repent! A new dawn has risen over Kumarkand and just as Surakels light burns away all darkness, so will we become a shining beacon of light and eventually restore the proper order of things in all of Bulwar."
 
 F30_honouring_word_title:0 "Honouring our Word"
 F30_honouring_word_desc:0 "Just as Akalšes stood by us in our hour of need and helped to throw off the yoke of Varamhari tyranny, so shall we help our Younger Brother in regaining their rightful lands around lake Naza. Let no one say that Kumarkand does not honour its promises."
 
 F30_zanites_again_title:0 "Zanites Together Again"
 F30_zanites_again_desc:0 "Along the middle Suran and the Buranun from lake Naza to the border of the lowlands along the gulf of glass lies the heartland of Bulwar. And the culture and traditions of its people, the Zanites, are not only the epitome of Bulwari high civilization but it is also the culture of empires. Both Karqašlu and Akalšes were founded by the ancestors of the Zanites. And now we have taken up the mantle and united all Zanites under our benevolent rule. The stronghold of civilization is united once more and ready to serve as the beating heart of a new empire!"
 
 F30_suran_flames_title:0 "Suran in Flames"
 F30_suran_flames_desc:0 "After those treacherous Akalšesi have been wiped from the map and the intractable priests of Eduz-Vacyn have been shown the error of their ways it is now time to bring the most distant part of Surakels Garden into our fold. The uppermost Suran and the Fortress of the Sun, Azka-Sur, with its renowned Confluence Temple, Eduz-Meduru, beckon. Let us raise the flag of Kumarkand over the easternmost great Temple along the Suran!"
 
 F30_empire_edge_title:0 "Empire's Edge"
 F30_empire_edge_desc:0 "We have reached the outer limits of Bulwari civilization. Beyond here lies only a scorching wasteland filled with malevolent gnolls, shrieking harpies and ferocious tribesmen unworthy of our attention. It is now our duty to protect the inhabitants of our newly gained lands and to return their war torn lands into the fecund garden it is supposed to be. And, just like our ancestors did, we will of course have to make sure that the dwarves of the mountains know their place and do not attempt to meddle in our affairs, like they were accustomed to with the pliable weaklings on the throne of Azka-Sur who allowed an undue influence from beneath the mountain."
 
 F30_regigning_ituqattar_title:0 "Reigning in the Ituqattar"
 F30_regigning_ituqattar_desc:0 "While nobody can doubt the pivotal role our valiant Ituqattar have played in the expansion of our empire's borders, this has led to a pervasive hubris amongst their ranks. Some whisper that they see themselves not as loyal servants of our Akal as willed by Surakel, but as the true power behind Kumarkands rise. There are murmurings in the corridors of the palace that our Akal is displeased with their demonstrations of independence both on and off the battlefield. It seems a reckoning is in order to remind the Ituqattar of their proper place in the ordained order."
 
 F30_crowning_empire_title:0 "Crowning a Empire"
 F30_crowning_empire_desc:0 "The astonishing rise of Kumarkand from backwater vassal state to undisputed hegemon of all of Bulwar has convinced many that this was the will of Surakel at work, His hand guiding the Akal in his quest to return order to Surakels Garden. But with the conquests resulting from the military and diplomatic successes of the recent past new challenges have arisen. Kumarkand is no longer one petty Akalate of many, but an empire in all but name. And at its heart, every empire is the manifestation of an idea that is strong enough to bind its many disparate parts and their diverse denizens together. Not only the Karqašlu enthusiasts of the Qašnitu Revivalist Society have enthusiastically embraced the idea that donning the mantle of ancient Karqašlu is precisely what is needed to legitimise our rule. The decision how to proceed into the future now lies with our esteemed Akal."
 
 F30_conquerors_legion_title:0 "A Conqueror's Legion"
 F30_conquerors_legion_desc:0 "Strong, tenacious, resourceful - the Kumarkandi Rangers are idols for many of the sons and daughters of Karqašlu. While in theory their corps is separate from the regular army of the empire, in the mind of many they are just as much a part of Karqašlu and integral for many of its successes in the past. It is long overdue to dispense with the fiction that they are mere mercenaries and acknowledge the role they play in the inner workings of the imperial military. Let us inaugurate an imperial Sahiru Legion, a Legion for our Akalunakal composed of the most promising rangers, ready to enforce his will on all our enemies."
 
 F30_first_greatest_title:0 "First and Greatest"
 F30_first_greatest_desc:0 "Karqašlu, just like Sarnagir, the sun's winged herald, or the sun itself, is a physical manifestation of Surakels Will. The sun may set for a while and the world is plunged in darkness, but there is always, always a glorious new dawn! Ours is the first and greatest empire the many lands of Bulwar have known. And while many generations may have toiled after the first Karqašlu fell to the abominable forces of the Malevolent Dark during the Onslaught,  their suffering was not for naught. Surakels Garden is once again in the hands of its rightful Custodian. And this time we have proven ourselves more than a match for the forces of darkness from the depths as well as arrogant false god kings leading their followers astray while lazing around in luxury. Surakels will is revealed through the enlightened orders of our beloved Akalunakal and we shall strive tirelessly to ensure that this time the sun never sets on Karqašlu!"
 
 F30_balance_checks_title:0 "Balance Checks"
 F30_balance_checks_desc:0 "While our lands are prosperous, too much of our wealth flows directly into the treasury of our Varamhari overlords. If we ever want to become masters of our own destiny again, we need to redirect these treasures into our own coffers. With clever administrators that do not shy away from some creative accounting and the support of local merchants willing to bear a heavier tax burden for a noble cause we will find a much better use for the riches of our lands and hopefully leave our temporary masters none the wiser."
 
 F30_bulwari_business_title:0 "Bulwari Business"
 F30_bulwari_business_desc:0 "If there is one thing that can be relied upon in the evershifting quicksand of shifting alliances that characterise Bulwari politics ever since the fall of the Phoenix empire, it is the unflinching sense for business opportunities amongst the Council of Twelve Families that rule the venerable metropolis of Bulwar. Let us approach these Barkabti magnates with an irresistible offer. A substantial contribution to the rebuilding efforts necessary after the plunder of the city by the gnollish hordes of Tluukt in return for their one-off military support when our uprising begins."
 
 F30_tactics_rebellion_title:0 "Tactics of Rebellion"
 F30_tactics_rebellion_desc:0 "While we would like to claim to be the first amongst the Bulwari to shake off the shackles of elven rule, another has beat us in this regard. Dartaxes rose up during the Decades of Devastation in Bahar and has defended his lands against any elven attempts to subdue him and his followers ever since. We might be well advised to try to learn their tactics and glean their secrets in order to help our coming insurrection."
 
 F30_break_soil_title:0 "Break the Soil"
 F30_break_soil_desc:0 "Mother Buranun always blessed the lands of Kumarkand with fertile soil and rich harvests. Our people have thrived on the lush shores of the river and grown in number. Now that we have finally removed the last traces of devastation caused by the disastrous campaigns of our former Varamhari overlords against the harpies, we can focus again on improving our lands and planting new fields. Some say that beneath some of the hills along the river banks lie the remains of ancient settlements, much like the ruins of fabled Panu Karqašlu near our capital. Who knows what we will discover once we level them to make room for new fields?"
 
 F30_finest_host_title:0 "Finest of Hosts"
 F30_finest_host_desc:0 "Our gracious Akal had the inspired idea to turn our peoples traditional skill with horse riding into a strong military advantage against any opponent by creating an elite charioteer force. To honour our venerated ancestors this host will be called Ituqattar like the legendary charioteers of old that crushed any foe foolish enough to stand against the might of the Karqašlu empire. And just like these warriors of old our new Ituqattar will be the fist that breaks anyone who stands against us."
 
 F30_honest_work_title:0 "Honest Work"
 F30_honest_work_desc:0 "Our peasants are hardworking, diligent and knowledgeable in the temperamental ways of Mother Buranun and the turning of the seasons. But as the wise men say there is always room for improvement. The halflings found in the lands on the far western edge of the world have a well-deserved reputation as prodigious farmers that could turn even a desert into a blooming garden. Our records from the time of the Jexisian empire tell tales of mutually beneficial dealings between our troops stationed in the west and these halflings. Let us invite some of these Moonfoot halflings to our lands to become Sunfoots and help increase our harvests to feed the people of our growing empire."
 
 F30_bulwari_sundriders_title:0 "Bulwari Sunriders"
 F30_bulwari_sundriders_desc:0 "Ever since we convinced them to follow us and reclaim their former glory, our elven Sarraka forces have proven to be an invaluable asset for our armies without whom many battles might have turned out quite differently. But with our borders expanding in all directions it becomes more and more apparent that they cannot be everywhere at once. Those original members that remain are increasingly stretched beyond their limits, serving as the sorcerous cavalry vanguard of our armies as well as bodyguards for our Akal and important members of the court. Given that only so many new elven recruits leave Ulmiš Idiqlat every year to replace those sunriders who have fallen or retired, it is clear to even the staunchest traditionalist that things have to change. The former mage prison in Azkabar has therefore been chosen as the site of the new Sarraka headquarters and the ranks of the sunriders have been opened up to human mages willing to serve, returning the Sarraka to their origins. Even some former inmates of Azkabar, who were wrongfully imprisoned simply for showing a talent for magic as a human, have already joined their ranks."
 
 F30_kasnitu_society_title:0 "Qašnitu Revivalist Society"
 F30_kasnitu_society_desc:0 "While our people have always been proud of our exalted past, the unprecedented successes of the recent past have sparked a more fervent passion for the lives of our Qašnitu ancestors in some members of our cultural elite. The most zealous admirers of ancient Karqašlu and all its glories have joined together to form the Qašnitu Revivalist Society with the purpose of unearthing the wisdom of our ancestors and returning modern Kumarkandi society to the heights of civilization enjoyed in antiquity. Their spokesmen have proposed to build a hall of learning to study all aspects of our illustrious past and apply the lessons learned to improve our present"
 
 F30_farming_act_title:0 "Kumarkandi Farming Act"
 F30_farming_act_desc:0 "It is by the grace of our glorious Akal that even the lowest of peasants is not forgotten in Kumarkand. A massive program of dike construction, building of intricate irrigation networks, reclamation of barren fields and the accompanying infrastructure from bridges and roads to mills and grain silos has been undertaken under orders from the palace. And the effort surely has paid off. Our already fertile lands are now almost overflowing with crops and teeming with livestock. Small bedraggled villages are prospering again and peasantry as well as cityfolk are well fed. All thanks to our wise Akal and his farming act!"
 
 F30_project_mortality_title:0 "Project Mortality"
 F30_project_mortality_desc:0 "The helmets found in the ruins of Panu Karqašlu confer some kind of immunity against magic. Aside from being a fascinating find that has kept our mages busy with theorising in the last decades, the decidedly practical applications of this have not gone unnoticed. It is the express desire of our Akal to restore as many of the helmets as possible and if necessary recreate them to outfit an entire army. This requires a heroic effort by our scholars and mages, as well as brave volunteers who will test out the new helmets and help work out possible design flaws in the unlikely event they should occur."
 
 F30_emperors_vengeance_title:0 "Emperor's Vengeance"
 F30_emperors_vengeance_desc:0 "All across Karqašlu barracks are bustling with new recruits, armouries are restocked, food stores are filled to the brim, marching roads are inspected and the imperial treasury is groaning under the strain of military expenditure. The signs are unmistakable - the empire prepares to march to war! The question on everyone's mind however is who is the target of the Akalunakals ire? Is it the gnollish slavers across the desert, the rich princes of Rahen, the western lands across the Divenhal or even the ferocious centaur hordes north of the Serpentspine who squat in the ancestral homeland of the Gigiru who founded the first Karqašlu empire? Those with well-placed connections in the imperial palace however receive disturbing reports of increasingly manic rants of the Akalunakal against the insular inhabitants of Kheterata and their indolent catlike overlords. Whatever they have done to enrage Alušir must be very grave indeed to warrant such an obsessive craving for vengeance, but not even the inner circle of his advisors seem to have a clear idea what offence precisely was committed."
 
 F30_elikhets_nightmare_title:0 "Elikhet's Nightmare"
 F30_elikhets_nightmare_desc:0 "It is done, timeworn Kheterata is no more, Elikhet’s spawn are left without their sycophantic servants, and all Elikhet’s works have been turned into dust! Alušir has been in a celebratory mood for a while now and has been observed to suffer paroxysms of laughter whenever the topic of our new Kheteratan holdings is brought up. Instead of shrines to self-absorbed khets who are only focused on their own pleasures and indifferent to the fate of their followers, newly erected temples to Surakel now adorn the shore of the Mother’s Sorrow and after millenia of being misled by Elikhet the Deceiver the people of Kheterata have started to rejoin their Bulwari brethren in the worship of Surakel. Of course there are still obstinate holdouts who still prescribe to the old ways but they, too, will learn that a new age has dawned and the Stewardship of the Sorrow is a thing of the past. Whether they do so out of their own volition or with some gentle or not so gentle persuasion remains to be seen."
 
 F30_triumphs_empire_title:0 "Triumphs of Empire"
 F30_triumphs_empire_desc:0 "It is the prerogative of empires of all ages to take the finest accomplishments that subjugated lands have created as an offering and use it to enrich the imperial heartlands and we shall do no less. The Mother’s Sorrow is renowned across Halann as an unrivalled breadbasket capable of feeding countless hungry mouths. The agricultural techniques honed over the millennia might translate very well and allow us to tease even more crops from the fertile soil along the banks of Suran and Buranun. Another Kheteratan tradition that might be worth preserving is their uncanny ability to remake foreigners arriving on their shores, be they invaders or refugees, in their image. Let us open our arms to deserving strangers desiring to start anew, be they human, harpy, halfling, elf or dwarf - and maybe even gnolls, goblins and orcs. Let them weave themselves in the rich, multihued and shining silk tapestry that is Bulwari society and begin their existence anew bathed in Surakels benevolent light."
 
 F30_rangers_call_title:0 "Rangers On Call"
 F30_rangers_call_desc:0 "North of the river valley of Mother Buranun lie vast stretches of grassy plains gently rising up to the Harpy Hills that have been used for cattle farming since ancient times. These open lands have given rise to a peculiar type of herdsman, the Kumarkandi Ranger or Sahiru. Not only are they undisputed experts of cattle herding and traversing the remote hinterlands but they also guard their charges against predators both animal and sentient. This particular skill set has time and time again led to Sahirus taking up their wip, bow and blade and dealing with more obscure threats plaguing local villagers. We would be well advised to endear ourselves to this hard-bitten lot so that in turn we may avail ourselves to their services when needed."

It was he who, himself mortally wounded, slew the fallen goddess Nikšaru, mother of all harpies. After battling the forces of darkness for many years clad in the legendary armour granted to him by his divine mother, he gathered a group of legendary heroes to end the depredations of Nikšaru once and for all. \n\n Our sages have come to the conclusion that all clues point to Dimuzi being a Mišari, a half-elf, born of a human of royal Karqašlu blood and a precursor elven mother who chose to remain in Bulwar after the rest of her people left for their homelands in Aelantir. He has therefore become something of a patron hero for the Mišari in our lands who point to his heroic acts as proof that they as well have a purpose in Surakels Garden. \n\n Let us build a grand temple in his memory, where the faithful can pray to Surakel and aspire to be worthy of performing similar deeds in Surakels name.

The envoy asks for Irrliam to provide military support in its upcoming war against Varamhar and offers in return the creation of a unified grain market; which would stabilise the price of grain and provide us greater income from export tariffs. Furthermore this might be a great opportunity for us to cripple Varamhar while getting a loyal ally as a neighbour.

In exchange Kumarkand promised to send us labourers to repair any damage Bulwar would sustain during war and that our companies would have a 20 year monopoly on reconstruction contracts within Kumarkand. Such a monopoly would boost our local industries substantially and since their terms don’t specify war related damage, can entitle us to reconstruction contracts after natural disasters. However, success is not guaranteed and proximity to Varamhar would entail harsh punishments in case of failure.

Despite repeated reassurances that the legendary Sarraka were employed for peaceful purposes, contradictory statements by various noble families speaking of countering the threat of gnolls, goblins, orcs, and even trolls, Varamhar remains unconvinced.

The Counts face soured as his worst fears came to fruition and he tossed his lantern out into the street. Within seconds cloaked figures entered the alley from both ends and surrounded the Akal. Before the Akal could shout for help the cloaked figures began stabbing the Akal, who looked at the Count for help; who blankly stared as the Akal realised they had been betrayed by their closest friend.

Eventually, they arrived at the old palace, where once great leaders called their home, and where a group of Kumarkandi patriots had first sworn to overthrow Varamhar. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] stood in the very place where history had been made so many times, yet felt not awe but bitter regret. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] could see so much greatness, yet didn’t have a legacy of their own. The Akal racked their brain, trying to come up with something that could last thousands of years. Then, the Akal spotted a faint sparkle beneath the cracked stone – and found an old magical chest housing a pristine Karqašlu flag. The Akal knew immediately – if they could not build a legacy, then they would reclaim it. \n\n The next week tens of thousands trudged through the tight streets of Panu Karqašlu, towards the old monolith where the Akal was due to hold a speech. Even despite the numbers, the old avenue could accommodate the crowd. Eventually, the Akal spoke. \n\n‘Varamhar is no more! We can now determine our own fate! But Kumarkand will not be truly free until we reclaim what was taken from us, and not only by Varamhar… For too long have we been stripped of our heritage! Our pride! Our birthright! We shall ignore it no longer! Look around you – do you see ruins to be pillaged? An ancient capital? Or do you see what I see, a legacy! Many have built empires, but few have built legacies which could stand the test of time like Panu Karqašlu has. Our ancestors built these buildings to last for thousands of years! So that we may use them… Yet we don’t. So what should we do? Ignore all the effort our ancestors made to build a future for us? Or do right by them and reclaiming the heritage they left for us? \n\nAfter the Akal finished, the crowd erupted in cheers, shouting out a mess of different chants – ‘reclaim Karqašlu,’ ‘long live Karqašlu,’ ‘avenge Karqašlu,’ ‘rebuild Karqašlu!’ Eventually, though, the crowds found a single voice, a single chant - ‘We are Karqašlu!’"

With the people of Annailsub and the Drolas peninsula already being expert seafarers and heavily reliant on trade; a local administration might be successful in developing these lands and building up the Divenhal fleet.

Despite Nilšranu's treachery in controlling Surakel and making him an unwilling father of Firanya, Surakels light still resides within the harpies. Since the light of Surakel continues to shine upon the Harpy Hills and the Harpies remain sentient, it would be against Surakels will to extinguish his light from them. \n\nWith the theologians guidance, the Akal is now confronted with the choice of either providing direct guidance to the Harpies by directly integrating them or creating a vassalage which would be taught in the Bulwari ways by our guidance.

Wells were poisoned and sealed shut, ancient canal and dikes were strategically destroyed by army engineers to maximise collateral damage, and pit mines from whence every brick that Kheterat was built on, were flooded. When the main invasion forces left and the garrisons arrived they found a city in ruin, where the few residents which remained lived in squalor among the rubble and the once proud residents begged the Karqašlu soldiers for food.

Then came the voices; promising loyalty, pleading for mercy, and an orchestra of horrid screams. Followed by visions; a king sat atop mountains of gold, grand armies clashed on the endless deserts, and a blooded king impaled by dozens of arrows. The Akal unexpectedly arrived back at the coronation stage, with their eyes now a brilliant prismatic silver, shimmering with every colour as all those affected continued to suffer, until the Akal spoke and it arrived: clarity. \n\n‘I am Kar Alušir of Karqašlu, Emperor of all Qašnitu, conqueror of Bulwar, immortal among immortals, and henceforth emperor evermore of Karqašlu.’ Decades of madness were washed away by serenity as a voice, which had only spoken to the Akal, revealed itself. Few knew of Kar Alušir of Karqašlu, and those who did only knew of his madness and defeat at the hands of Elikhet the Wanderer. Yet his authoritative voice was soothing, enchanting almost – the crowd found their worries easing.\n\n‘Although you might not know my name, you have known my guidance and protection! Those magical helmets are the medium from which my magic flows into you, but in exchange allows me to possess your body.’ the word possession raised some anxiety – but those feelings quickly slipped away. It was nothing short of a miracle as Kar Aluširs words alone calmed the mind and soul. \n\n‘All future Akals shall rule on my behalf and act as my medium should I need to walk upon the mortal plane. In return all Akals can tap into my endless well of magic and have the privilege of holding the title Akalunakal Alušir. But make no mistake, the Akal is the akal and I Kar Alušir am the emperor! On the occasions I grace Halann with my presence, you shall refer to me by my humble title of Kar Alušir, Emperor of all Qašnitu, conqueror of Bulwar, immortal among immortals, and emperor evermore of Karqašlu. With my royal lineage finally restored, Karqašlu is truly reborn! May this day go down in history as not only the greatest day in Bulwar’s history, but also the greatest in Halann’s as well!’"

But now everything was exactly as it needed to be. Karqašlu was reborn and the whole world was his to mould. Yet he knew he could not act with haste, Kar Alušir was immortal but without proper vision Karqašlu could crumble yet again. So he pondered, searching through the royal library for the birth and death of empires, coming to three paths for the empire. \n\nKar Alušir had not been there to witness it, but Karqašlu had collapsed after an event called The Onslaught brought about by the Deep Devils. Had such an event not occurred maybe Karqašlu would not have collapsed millenia ago. Perhaps, without foreign intervention, the institutions and traditions of Karqašlu were hardy enough to stand the test of time; and any radical departure from the status-quo would ironically spell their doom. \n\nAnother option which enticed Kar Alušir was the idea of a unified human state in Bulwar, Surakeš. Although he cared little for the mythos of a human nation-state, those who dreamed of Surakeš also venerated ancient Bulwari Paradise Gardens and architecture. If co-opted, the mythos of Surakeš would be the perfect justification for the exorbitant and extravagant buildings he had already planned; without dealing with the headache of citizens complaining about ruinous taxes and tributes. \n\nThe last option and most radical option was to recreate the zealous armies of the Jaddari legions to conquer all of Halann in Surakels name. Whether or not this was possible depended on if there are any legitimate heirs of Jadd around to contest such a claim."

Yet this discovery contradicted the archaeologists findings that the vault was constructed after the Call of Reflection, long after the precursor Elves had returned to Aelantir. For days scholars and archaeologists argued, dismissing each other's conclusions as false until the Akal, frustrated by the deadlock, decided to send in a group of specialists to open the vault door."

For hours they attempted to lockpick the door, until a homunculus intervened when it saw the party pull out explosives and unlocked the door. \n\nThey stared at the modest stone sarcophagus covered in overgrown vines, unable to read the name of the deceased yet they all knew who laid inside. Dimuzi the Half-immortal had a crest everybody could recognize, composed of his father royal Karqašlu heraldry and his mother floral crest; and etched into the stone was only Dimuzi’s floral crest. They knew not of the woman who laid inside the tomb besides the stories which they had heard of her, yet some in the party wept as if they were mourning their own mother. They cried thinking of the centuries she had been left alone; her tomb left in heart wrenching decay while her homunculus tended to her garden not because they ignored their duties, but because the duty never belonged to the homunculus.

The garden itself housed what some botanists suspect to be flora native to Aelantir predating the Day of Ashen Skies. The homunculi too were marvels of magic, functional for perhaps millenia without any visible degradation to their functions. The notes found around Dimuzi’s moms tomb took months to translate, but turned out to be the most valuable objects housed in the vault. \n\nThe notes recalled her time in Aelantir, manuals for maintenance of her homunculi and plants, and the rise of Karqašlu.

As labourers dug around to dislodge what they thought was a random rubble as was common near the ruins of Panu Karqašlu, more ornate stone emerged and it became clear they were dealing with no mere rubble but a buried structure. \n\nAn archaeological team led by Temenos Fula painstakingly excavated around the structure for months until an ancient Karqašlu temple, from the imperial period, emerged. The discovery of a near perfectly preserved temple was perplexing as almost all of Panu Karqašlu’s ruins tended to be aboveground and buried ruins were always decayed beyond recognition. The stone used was suspected to be from the Serpentreach Mountains, but not of Dwarven craftsmanship. After dispelling the magical lock, they entered a grand atrium but found not a place of common prayer, rather a ceremonial hall lined with dozens of columns. Each column was chiselled with images of Karqašlu’s founding, rise and ended most curiously with Karqašlu’s conquest of all of Kheterata, an historic event which never occurred. After further investigation the team found a hidden staircase under a grand headless statue of Karqašlu emperor and arrived at a storage room. Inside was thousands of lavish silver magical helmets, armour which cost a fortune for even the wealthiest modern empires let alone ones of antiquity. The magical implements which Temenos Fula brought to examine the helmets all malfunctioned in the presence of the helmets. While others who put on the helmets reported hearing strange voices emanating not from the helmets but within their skulls, with the noises persisting for days after being taken off. After the Akal visited the storage room, they were intrigued by the most elegant helmet perched on a pedestal which no one had been able to move.

Many amongst the faithful followers of the Jadd see the the evident failure of the summit as a sign of Suraels displeasure, for one the major topics to be discussed was the devising of a concerted strategy to stop the Desert Legion from advancing further down the Suran and bringing the Truth of the Jadd to even more parts of Bulwar. However, the Herald of Surael has proclaimed the events at Samartal to be a cause for mourning and a strike of the Malevolent Dark against all the faithful."

Leaving the smouldering corpse of the previous incarnation of our beloved ruler behind, the enemy disappeared into the unknown. \n\nIt appears Amussu the Silent, he who was once known as the Speaker of the Sky, last of the Bulwari God-kings, has escaped his eternal prison and begun his quest for ancient artefacts imbued with fragments of his former power to prepare his return to rule over all of Bulwar. \n\nA fuming Alušir, after reorienting himself in his latest body, has ordered the Magušim of the realm to provide him with inscribed sorcerous weapons and tools to empower his magic capabilities and provide an edge for the next confrontation with this presumptuous God-king."

Fortunately for Karqašlu, Blood feuds are Kar Alušir’s specialty and as a result he has been planning to strike back at the sea devils for months. \n\nKnowing that kinetic weaponry would tumble and rapidly decelerate in water, Kar Alušir had made it clear any attack on the sea devils required specialised spells. As such while the army created testing pools multiple kilometres deep, every able bodied mage in Karqašlu gathered to discuss how they could strike deep into the ocean. While lightning and poison were popular at first, testing revealed that their effective reach was more limited than first thought. After many more weeks of testing and debate, anything short of summoning the largest damestear meteor Bulwar had ever seen seemed to be an impractical option. \n\nAnd so that’s what they began to plan – but as all other options were being weeded out, a dwarven fire mage called Lubod Firebeard proposed a radical solution; burning all the oxygen in the water. Apparently Lubod Firebeard had cleared vast sections of the Serpentspine of goblins and orcs by depriving them of oxygen – he believed that with some tweaking a spell to burn the oxygen in the water could be devised. \n\nWhile the less experienced mages manned the forts in case the ritual backfired, the experienced mages manned the various magical installations channelling their magic into the ritual instruments. As the day went by a haze appeared above the ocean, while steam began to rise from the surface. The ocean slowly began to turn first yellow, then a vibrant orange, and finally a fiery red; almost as if the whole ocean had caught fire. For the next couple hours the horizon remained a brilliant red, as thousands of fish carcasses rose to the surface. Common fish carcasses were all that rose, however – by the end of the day it seemed that all that was accomplished was the destruction of the local ecosystems and reclamation of Karqašlu’s damaged pride."

While some have leg like appendages, others walk upon any number of tentacles, others yet slither on either flesh or clusters of tentacles, and fewer yet crawl on the ground by pulling themselves forward with barbed tentacles. Although some have chunks of flesh which resemble heads atop their bodies, these clusters of tissue serve no purpose as their eyes, mouth, and teeth are dotted across their body. Some dissected deep devils were found to have only one heart, while others had as many as twelve hearts, ranging in size from as small as a grape to as large as a melon. The largest heart found so far continues to beat like a drum, its sound echoing through the halls of laboratory weeks after being torn out of its supposedly mortal body. Further questions remain regarding the intellect of the deep devils as the number, size, and location of their brains vary between dissected specimens. Some had no discernible brain matter while others had interlaced clods of clammy tendrils which quivered at the slightest touch. A few sea devils have been found with burn marks across their bodies, but the vast majority seem to have not been impacted by the spell that was cast on the ocean many years ago. These dissected deep devils have confirmed our greatest fears, there is no uniform anatomy to these devils which we could exploit. To kill a deep devil requires total annihilation of their deformed bodies. \n\nKar Alušir, Emperor of all Qašnitu, conqueror of Bulwar, immortal among immortals, and emperor evermore of Karqašlu has already begun rallying the troops, vowing to not only to exterminate these abominations which dare pollute Karqašlu, but also to rectify once and for all the humiliation Karqašlu faced at the ha-tenctales of these deep devils."

Citizens fleeing the deep devils recall hearing the distant screams of people pleading to be killed, to be put out of their misery. Vanguards of adventurers also reported hearing human voices in the midst of the deep devils hordes, but couldn’t find the source of the voices due to overwhelming numbers of deep devils in this new wave. With the arrival of this new wave of deep devils, perhaps it was overly optimistic to expect our battle with the deep devils a year prior to have been a conclusive blow. \n\nKar Alušir, Emperor of all Qašnitu, conqueror of Bulwar, immortal among immortals, and emperor evermore of Karqašlu has vowed to once again vanquish the deep devils regardless of their increased numbers, as all shall bow before the might of Karqašlu."

Arms, legs, organs, fingers, and eyes twitching as if they were trying to break free of their tentacles and grey slimy flesh which shackled them. But that is the fate of those who could be considered lucky as, unfortunately, the source of the human voices within the deep devils has been uncovered. The deep devils have not limited themselves to only integrating human appendages but also somehow still fully conscious human heads; capable of not only crying out for help but also fully aware of who they were before their mutilation and integration into the deep devils. \n\nWith such savagery at our doorsteps once more, it is no wonder that volunteers and veterans alike have answered Kar Alušir, Emperor of all Qašnitu, conqueror of Bulwar, immortal among immortals, and emperor evermore of Karqašlu call to arms, ready to crush the darkness ashore on Bulwar."

Prioritising military targets instead of undefended villages, their armies march in proper formation without their ranks immediately splintering into smaller despoiler groups. Unlike the savagery of the first few waves, deep devils this gargantuan wave are remarkably disciplined for abominations unblessed by Surakels light. Within their ranks there are distinct groups of deep devils with fossilised broken bones extending out instead of freshly mutilated human limbs, their grey slimy skin covered in hundreds of light-grey scars, and many with dismembered irregular tentacles. Weathered browned human skulls covered in barnacles and corals, ancient remains of brave humans who perished fighting the deep devils centuries, perhaps millenia, ago. No doubt veterans of the first onslaught who destroyed the glorious first Karqašlu empire 2000 years ago, brought in to finish the job. \n\nWith our ancient enemy once again at our doorstep thousands of patriotic citizens answered Kar Alušir, Emperor of all Qašnitu, conqueror of Bulwar, immortal among immortals, and emperor evermore of Karqašlu call to arms and rallied behind the banner of Karqašlu once more.

It is frankly remarkable that our ancestors two millennia ago were able to hold out so long against an enemy which easily brought our whole coastline to ruin. Yet Batur II’s dream of a grand Karqašlu did not end with his passing, but stayed alive in the stories, songs, and myths the people of Bulwar told each other. Make no mistake, our victory over the deep devils is not the effort of any one man alone, rather we stand tall because we stand atop the shoulders of giants. We stand atop the shoulders of Batur II’s sacrifice, atop the shoulders of those who kept Karqašlu alive for two millenia, atop the shoulders of those who freed us from the tyranny of Varamhar, and atop the hundreds of thousands of citizen soldiers who fought the deep devils.

The heresies that dominated the Sun Cult for centuries have been marginalised and the faithful are increasingly receptive to follow the ways of their forefathers and more and more worship Surakel as he has been revered for centuries before the coming of Jaher"
