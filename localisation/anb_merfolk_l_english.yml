 merfolk_events.1.t:0 "Brighter than Pearl"
 merfolk_events.1.d:0 "It spawned from minute encounters with blessed tailwinds or against vexing headwinds, each some manner of curious, unfortunate, or joyous. Breaking the surface barrier, each interaction earnt a grain of trust, and now those minute grains form the very foundation of our relationship; from tourists to explorers to merchants to kings and diplomats, the merfolk nations seek further rapport with [Root.GetName]. The merfolk rose to meet us, and we accepted them as aquatic kin. Now, we consider one another pledged allies, ready to weather the storms that threaten either."
 merfolk_events.1.a:0 "Let the surface and sea sing united!"
 merfolk_events.2.t:0 "The Storm Passes"
 merfolk_events.2.d:0 "A storm, no matter how destructive, dwindles, exhausting itself of its own fury. In the aftermath, there is no peace–merely the absence of destruction. The forgotten lives and raked landscapes linger like a wound. The merfolk aggression, whether or not just, falters, and the realms of land and ocean breathe deep of the calm."
 merfolk_events.2.a:0 "What future awaits us now?"
 merfolk_events.3.t:0 "Opening their Shell"
 merfolk_events.3.d:0 "Day after day, wave after wave, the ocean’s caress whittles even the hardest defenses. The merfolk that swim through our waters are no exception, our recent interactions lowering their wary guard. Rather than keeping to themselves and hiding amid the boundless blue, they instead allow themselves to be seen, approached, and even spoken to. Despite the warming entente, there is still a way to go before the merfolk treat us as friendly neighbors."
 merfolk_events.3.a:0 "This is a brand new chapter in sea-surface relations."
 merfolk_events.4.t:0 "Fading Away?"
 merfolk_events.4.d:0 "There is a sense of irritation on the part of the merfolk. They do not approve of some aspects of our dealings with them, and this has in turn led to a coldness in our interactions with them that did not exist beforehand. Make no mistake, they are still willing to deal with us—but until our relationship trends towards improvement it is likely that the sorts of sweetheart deals they offered us are likely off the table."
 merfolk_events.4.a:0 "Not... quite business as usual."
 merfolk_events.5.t:0 "Darkened Waters"
 merfolk_events.5.d:0 "The waters churn with anger—the outrage of the merfolk! Indications from what few contacts we still have in their midst indicate a deep feeling of betrayal arising from our dealings with them. It appears that recent hostile acts on their part are an attempt to convince us to deal with them in a manner that suits them better. Whether or not we take the hint they are clearly trying to give us by lashing out so, however, is ours to determine."
 merfolk_events.5.a:0 "We have set them off, haven't we."
 merfolk_events.6.t:0 "Shoals Have Arisen"
 merfolk_events.6.d:0 "There is practically no communication from the merfolk these days. It seems our actions have convinced them that there is no use maintaining any form of contact with us. Where once the waters almost boiled with their anger, there is naught but silence. The one merman we have come across in recent times regarded our sailors with a grim cast to his face, no longer pledging revenge so much as betraying a feeling of exhaustion at being let down so often."
 merfolk_events.6.a:0 "All of us to ourselves, is it?"
 merfolk_events.7.t:0 "One Above, One Below"
 merfolk_events.7.d:0 "A child cries out to its mother in amazement. "Mother, mother! There's a town under the sea!"\n\n"Are you crazy? Stay away from there, that's a precursor ruin!"\n\n"No, mom, it's real! Go look!"\n\nThe mother goes to the edge of the sea; her eyes boggle. Not far from where the settlement on the coast ends and the ocean begins, there is indeed a town under the sea. The merfolk of the area, having determined that [Root.GetName] is a suitable terrestrial neighbour, have decided to grace us with an underwater city right next to our own town in [Root.GetName]."
 merfolk_events.7.a:0 "Hm. Are droughts to them what floods are to us?"
 merfolk_events.10.t:0 "A Fishy Love Story"
 merfolk_events.10.d:0 "Some idiot fell in love with a merfolk and drowned. the community blames the merfolk, but the merfolk say the dead body floating down to their town was hella traumatic"
 merfolk_events.10.a:0 "He was just an idiot"
 merfolk_events.10.b:0 "Damn merfolk seducing our women"
 merfolk_events.10.c:0 "Pay the merfolk a gift of a cool ass trident as compensation"
 merfolk_events.11.t:0 "Merfolk Caught in Our Traps"
 merfolk_events.11.d:0 "Recently, fishers along our coasts have staged a mass action protest. One by one, they have dumped their equipment in public squares across the nation with simmering displeasure: cut fish nets, bloody and bent hooks, tangled lines, busted traps, and even whole boats. Standing next to the water-logged piles, the fishers explain their stunt plainly and loudly.\n\nFor months now, their fishery hauls have ensnared a rising number of merfolk. Overcoming a difficult and tense first contact, communications with the unwanted captives revealed that these merfolk aren't malicious, only unfortunately oblivious, and the fishers concur; After all, what use is a merfolk for a fishmonger's stall? Still, the frequent incidents threaten our fishers' livelihoods, reducing yields and amplifying equipment costs.\n\nWe can dissuade the merfolk from traversing in our fishing lanes, yet this is sure to sour surface-sea relations. Seeking a compromise, we might limit select fishing methods and forbid fishing in certain areas, souring our salty trawlers but gaining some merfolk goodwill. Finally, enforcing heavy restrictions would endear the sea kingdoms to our nation in exchange for greatly reducing fish yields and angering our fishers. How should we proceed?"
 merfolk_events.11.a:0 "Our fish supply is paramount, merfolk be damned."
 merfolk_events.11.b:0 "Find a compromise between our fishers' needs and the merfolk's safety. "
 merfolk_events.11.c:0 "Formally legislate our fishing methods to protect the merfolk."
 merfolk_events.12.t:0 "Curious Similarities"
 merfolk_events.12.d:0 "A ruinborn scholar from the distant lands of Noruin, adrift on the winds of discovery, has begun causing unrest among our merfolk. Initially ingratiating herself among our nation’s mixed elven enclave, she wielded her global expertise to great effect, earning a post as a dockmaster for a major seaside port. During her tenure, she met several merfolk traders and aquatic companies seeking business. Her polite chatter quietly shifted from professional to curious to uncomfortable: “So your people arose from the dark seas of the West?”; “Do you find our complexions...comparable?”; and “Do you find it odd how much your sea vernacular mirrors my native Kwineh?”\n\nShe was eventually fired from her dock master job amid a particularly aggressive argument between her and a merfolk, but instead of reflecting on her beliefs, she has reforged herself into a syncretic preacher seeking some grand unity of elvenkind. She claims that our native merfolk were once elves from old Aelantir. Already a shocking prospect, she further declares that, much like her people's bat-like features, their divine elven blood adapted to the ocean itself, allowing them to flee the Ruin of Aelantir. “Of course,” she patronizingly proposes, “we can return even these fish elves to their forgotten greatness. They need only be united by our great Precursor legacy and abandon their crooked and ignorant superstitions.”\n\nThe merfolk aren't too happy to have their histories, cultures, and long struggles against the inky dark reduced to “fish elves,” and so they plead that we officially censor the preacher, claiming that her words demean them and cause undue discrimination despite living in local seas for centuries. We might, of course, also bring this ruinborn into our fold, ensuring her zealous visions align with our national interests. To whom shall we adhere?"
 merfolk_events.12.a:0 "Accept this ruinborn's message as a divine breakthrough."
 merfolk_events.12.b:0 "Heed the merfolk's request and censor this mad upstart."
 merfolk_events.12.c:0 "One of our advisors says there might be some truth to the ruinborn’s words..."
 merfolk_events.12.t:0 "Curious Hypothesis"
 merfolk_events.13.d:0 "An ocean-breaking series of treatises from one of our brightest minds is making waves among our swelling scientific community. Titled “On the Origins of Sarhalian Sapience,” the papers feature the latest anthropological hypotheses and evidence about past and present peoples in our lands. While a monumental development in understanding our collective histories, the hypothesis on merfolk upends millennia-old precedents for the aquatic dwellers.\n\nThe author began examining various elven populaces descending from Aelantir to Bulwar as part of $COUNTRY$'s immigrant history, establishing notable similarities with the merfolk such as language, magical affinity, and ear-fin structure, among other details. After extensive research, the author concluded that merfolk derived from the fabled precursors. Highlighting similar divergences for the diverse ruinborn, they also suggested that the magical fallout from the Day of Ashen Skies accelerated their physiological changes into the merfolk we know today.\n\nNeedless to say, the discovery has shocked and captivated both sea and surface communities while heaping renown upon the scientist. What a wondrous discovery!"
 merfolk_events.13.a:0 "This brilliant scientist deserves state support"
 merfolk_events.13.b:0 "So that ruinborn advisor glimpsed a fraction of truth after all."
 merfolk_events.13.c:0 "So that crazy ruinborn preacher grasped some fact after all."
 merfolk_events.14.t:0 "Beachfront Protests"
 merfolk_events.14.d:0 "The waterways in [merfolk_settlement.GetName] have always been bustling with activity, yet bubbling displeasure has recently joined the energetic waves. Merfolk, breaching the surface in organized groups, have begun impeding vessels, jeering passerby, and vandalizing ocean-side buildings with slogans such as 'fin or feet, where we greet, all should meet.'\n\nDespite their disparate methods, their impact is the same: our activity in the area thoughtlessly disrupts and impedes those beneath the waves. The merfolk point to the damaged flora and fauna of their home, a lack of water-accessible buildings for their merchants and visitors, and tumultuous currents caused by unending ship traffic.\n\nOn the one hand, we can reconsider how we live along the shore and share the waters with our aquatic neighbors, earning their trust. On the other hand, who do they think they are, telling us what to do?! How should we respond to these beachfront protests?"
 merfolk_events.14.a:0 "Acquiesce for the good of our merfolk neighbors"
 merfolk_events.14.b:0 "Pah! Do they own the surface too?"
 merfolk_events.15.t:0 "Returned Flotsam"
 merfolk_events.15.d:0 "'Oh pearlescent [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], caretaker of $COUNTRY$, please accept this bounty dredged from within our domain. We claim all sunken goods by right of the endless blue, but given our peoples' accord, we have only claimed the lionfish's share to compensate for the damages caused by the refuse, both material and mental. From the remaining portion, we return these trinkets and goods to you, our surface allies.'\n\nSmiling softly, the merfolk envoy bows from his magical water bowl, gesturing to his flank as guards ferry in waterlogged loot. Bit by bit, the hoard stacks high until it forms a mound within the capital hall.\n\nEven during a calm year, $COUNTRY$ still loses untold quantities of cargo and ships to storms, war, and other misfortunes, but like a caring neighbor, the merfolk have returned a sizable portion of that lost wealth. Considering  [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] response, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] thinks swiftly: accepting the gesture would be a welcome bounty to the nation's coffers, but refusing it as the merfolk's right would also endear the sea peoples to $COUNTRY$. Of course, demanding all the treasure be returned is also a viable option, but what value is gold compared to trust?"
 merfolk_events.15.a:0 "Thank you for returning our lost goods"
 merfolk_events.15.b:0 "Please take it all as compensation for littering in your domain"
 merfolk_events.15.c:0 "If it's ours, we demand ecery bit back from the briny depths!"
 merfolk_events.16.t:0 "Youth Stranding"
 merfolk_events.16.d:0 "A fisher screams from her beach hut window, berating a trio of snickering kids lying on her sun drying tarps. An annoyed city cook dumps a bucket of water over a dehydrated teen reeling from their failed climb up to the restaurant's roof. A local guard, carrying his fifth trespasser back to the local estuary, dreads his captain's inevitable dress down for not completing his daily patrols.\n\nAs relations have strengthened between $COUNTRY$ and the local sea peoples, rambunctious merfolk youths have begun testing that trust. Playing a game called “land reefing,” impressionable players compete by dragging themselves ashore and relaxing in humorous spots: the further inland and more precarious, the funnier. Often drained from their antics, these teens rely on charitable locals to drag them back to the water's safety.\n\nTired of this new craze, our citizens gripe about the constant disturbances and rescue efforts, demanding we discipline these piscine daredevils. As a silver lining, the merfolk's parents, otherwise fearful of the surface world, extol our people for ensuring their children don't meet a dry and deadly end. What should we do about these mischief makers?"
 merfolk_events.16.a:0 "It's all in good fun"
 merfolk_events.16.b:0 "No more fun and games!"
 merfolk_events.17.t:0 "Childish Curiosity"
 merfolk_events.17.d:0 "“No! He's nice! He's my friend!”\n\nThe sunless chamber hushes, leaving only soundless gasps and offended stares. A young child stands in the center, his defiant gaze and pouting lips pointing against the local magistrate. His aghast parents try to rush to their son's defense, but the magistrate's guards bar them from the floor.\n\nThe magistrate turns her attention to the accrued pile of witness testimonies, flipping through several notable pages. To one onlooker, the child seemed enraptured by a diminutive creature seeking to drag them into the sea to consume like some ravening monster. To another, two children met and marveled at their divided worlds:  fin and feet, standing and swimming, and the sand that connects them both.\n\nPondering on sea-surface relations, the magistrate stares at the hopeful child. She knows the history: fraught, tense, and sometimes violent. But seeing two youths meet without disdain or conflict fills her jaded heart with hope. Signalling with a lone hand, the magistrate dismisses the child without further hassle, letting him return home and to his friend. If left alone, she prays, this might be the necessary foundation for a kinder, more diplomatic future.\n\nThe question burning in her mind, however, was thus: How far should she press this serendipity with the people beneath the waves?"
 merfolk_events.17.a:0 "Let the affair fall where it may."
 merfolk_events.17.b:0 "Declare our intentions to deepen our bonds with the merfolk."
 merfolk_events.18.t:0 "Changing Tides: A Flood Approaching"
 merfolk_events.18.d:0 "TThe ministry chamber doors swing inward as a nervous spy scampers inside.\n“My [Root.Monarch.GetTitle],”—he realigns his disheveled cloak, billowed by the speed of news—“there is a stirring beneath the waves in $COUNTRY$.”\n\nSetting duplicated letters, coded messages, and a scrawled map canvassing the latest landmarks in the merfolk's aquatic territory before the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], the spy spreads the pages to best illustrate the full picture.\n\n“The merfolk in $COUNTRY$ have undergone a drastic realignment. The details remain murky on who, how, and why, but the result is undeniable: a new force has arisen to lead their community, painting their former anti-surface policy as backwards. We are uncertain how altruistic their intentions are, but they are already seeking ingress with $COUNTRY$ as a key goal of their new government, even promising tribute to ensure our future cooperation.”\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] considers [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] nation's history with the merfolk. Though the merfolk peoples are just as diverse and divided as the surface, the settlement's recent realignment represents a welcome development for strengthening relations with the ocean foreigners.\n\nThe spy remains tense, asking only:\n“What shall I relay as our policy, my [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]?”"
 merfolk_events.18.a:0 "Accept the tribute, but do little else"
 merfolk_events.18.b:0 "No gifts needed; treat them as beloved guests and neighbors."
 merfolk_events.19.t:0 "Changing Tides: An Ebb"
 merfolk_events.19.d:0 "The ministry chamber doors swing inward as a nervous spy scampers inside.\n“My [Root.Monarch.GetTitle],”—he realigns his disheveled cloak, billowed by the speed of news—“there is a stirring beneath the waves in $COUNTRY$.”\n\nSetting duplicated letters, coded messages, and a scrawled map canvassing the latest landmarks in the merfolk's aquatic territory before the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], the spy spreads the pages to best illustrate the full picture.\n\n“The merfolk in $COUNTRY$ have undergone a drastic realignment.

Though the merfolk peoples are just as diverse and divided  as the surface, the settlement's recent realignment represents a vexing development on the path to improve relations with the ocean foreigners.\n\nThe spy remains tense, asking only:\n“What shall I relay as our policy, my [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]?”"
 merfolk_events.19.a:0 "Grant them tribute to maintain some goodwill."
 merfolk_events.19.b:0 "If they wish to sabotage our relations, then so be it."
 merfolk_events.20.t:0 "Witch-King under the Sea"
 merfolk_events.20.d:0 "Already susceptible to fickle currents and arbitrary policy, trade from the isolationist merfolk has noticeably slowed, spawning nervous rumors among our people: disease, war, curses from forgotten deep ones, and other gossip from the scandalous to the minute. Cutting through the empty dread of our imaginations, the latest merfolk merchant, a genial sunfish of a man, shared what has been affecting his people's visits.\n\nLike a dark tide blighting a pristine beach, a minor merfolk mage manifested some ill-gotten power, ascended the ranks of a lesser merfolk nation, and transformed it from a secondary player into a powerful pariah set on dominating the entire ocean. With grim hope, the merchant prays the arrayed merfolk coalition is enough to dethrone the rising tyrant, but he looks to the dying trade as an undeniable sign that it is a necessary yet doomed resistance.\n\nIt does not take a distant Cannorian to know what threat an unchecked Witch-King poses to the world. Should we mirror the merchant's idle hope that the merfolk coalition succeeds, support our fishy neighbors against this dangerous upstart, or send delegates in anticipation of the Witch-King's inevitable victory?"
 merfolk_events.20.a:0 "The sea will calm itself eventually."
 merfolk_events.20.b:0 "Make arrangements with this Witch-King to secure our interests."
 merfolk_events.20.c:0 "A threat to the merfolk is a threat to us all - Send aid!"
 merfolk_events.21.t:0 "A Calm Sea"
 merfolk_events.21.d:0 "Merfolk interactions withered to the point of memory. Day in, day out, the seas ebbed and flowed, and we watched like bystanders awaiting soaring or solemn news. Though we couldn't see it, we knew the oceans bled with conflict and death...\n\nAnd then they reappeared. One at first, then two, a caravan: merfolk fresh from the ocean depths. Though a few tossed harsh glances at our indifference, most seemed understanding of the surface's uninvolvement with ocean affairs. With tearful tales, they told how the merfolk coalition struggled to push the Witch-King's forces back. For each standstill or failure, the Witch-King obliterated entire settlements, and when the kelp banners thinned, they placed their last hopes on a do-or-die attack. By prayer, chance, or both, the assault managed to pierce the Witch-King's forces wide enough for a trained spearmaster to strike, cutting deep into the tyrant's chest. As the battlefield water turned from red to arcane blue, the ocean illuminated with deadly power before silence washed over the sea.\n\nIn the ultimate battle's aftermath, the merfolk still struggle to rebuild their status quo, and the grand coalition, lessened by the great war, has splintered since the true threat fell dead. From our dry perch, we applaud them for slaying the Witch-King, a threat to all, without our much-needed support.\n\nAs we resume contact with the devastated merfolk lands beneath the waves, let us raise our glasses to the lost and dead, for they were not our own..."
 merfolk_events.21.a:0 "The sea calms."
 merfolk_events.22.t:0 "A Demanding Sea"
 merfolk_events.22.d:0 "Against hope, we bet that the merfolk coalition would quell the Witch-King's ambition...without us. Against hope, we prayed that good would win...without us. Against history, we believed the Witch-King's might would flounder...without us.\n\nPerhaps it was for the best, then, that the first merfolk contact received after the Witch-King's victory is a tempered envoy. Awash with magical protections and flanked by terrible aquatic arcane creations, they greeted us in the name of the Master of the Waves, Keeper of the Kelp Leash Reefs, Grand Protector of the Submerged Realm, Speaker of the Pearly Truths, Piscine Master of the Arcane...and our newest “Mage-Guardian.”  Speaking plainly, they thanked us for our “clear intention to not interfere with my master's unification of the disparate merfolk realms,” and in recompense, they announced a favorable tribute system for us, their faithful vassals. To head off resistance, the envoy expressed that even a half-hearted refusal, a “spit in the ocean,” will elicit a tsunami of mage-powered retribution upon $COUNTRY$.\n\nNeedless to say, the demands have set the nation alight with indignity and fear. We lost our first opportunity to strike the tyrant down, but it need not be the only one. Unfortunately, a Witch-King's wrath is unparalleled, as the frightful refugees flooding our docks and rivers can attest. How should we respond to the Witch-King's impositions?"
 merfolk_events.22.a:0 "Sigh... Pay up"
 merfolk_events.22.b:0 "We bow to no foreign tyrants; Refuse!"
 merfolk_events.23.t:0 "Damning Arrangements"
 merfolk_events.23.d:0 "Without surprise or delay, the merfolk coalition faltered. A doomed aquatic crusade, valiant as it was, stood no chance against the might of a true Witch-King, merfolk or otherwise. In dark coves and submerged halls, we arbitrated new boundaries, established secret protocols, and shared guarantees on new sea-surface relations. The Witch-King's “peace” also demanded we report any merfolk resistance members who might hide in our waters, but for the good of our people along the coast, we acquiesced, thankful it did not entail any economic changes.\n\nWhen the first visitors from the new Witch-King's magocratic nation arrived on our coasts, our people gritted their teeth and held their breath. Against expectation, the visitors conducted their business in alignment with our deal and left without fuss. Unease prevaded the coasts, yet as money and goods flowed in, merchants and profit-seekers turned a blind eye to any merfolk cruelty. Even our fishers, mortified by the Witch-King's unholy minions, found their catches stuffed to the brim with an extra bloody helping of goods."
 merfolk_events.23.a:0 "Great news for us"
 merfolk_events.24.t:0 "Fighting a Witch-King is Expensive"
 merfolk_events.24.d:0 "With the aquatic war against the Witch-King in full swing, merfolk interactions have grown increasingly desperate. Deadly battles overrun by terrifying creatures, devastated merfolk cities, and rampant ecological destruction have ruined a generation of merfolk, and yet the war continues to grow.\n\nThe coalition leadership's arcane messages to us praise our expeditionary soldiers and supporting aquamancers, but each missive concludes with earnest requests for more: More fodder, more supplies, more everything. Perhaps it was foolish to assume the coalition would swiftly wipe away the Witch-King, but as reports fill in the fog of war, the Witch-King's resolve eclipses our initial estimates for victory.\n\nThe coalition rests squarely on $COUNTRY$ and our continued backing, yet can we afford to throw resources into a floundering cause?"
 merfolk_events.24.a:0 "Everything for victory!"
 merfolk_events.24.b:0 "We can't spare the resources"
 merfolk_events.25.t:0 "Fighting a Witch-King Requires Luck"
 merfolk_events.25.d:0 "Frenzied messages arrived from the sea, each denoting a coming battle. Then, silence. A day of dreaded, unnerving silence. As sweat collected on our brow, an arcane message broke the tension. A second. Dozens followed. Weeping, emotional, and fatigued, they imparted one word: Victory. We could not understand the full grasp of it at first, but after our expeditionary forces returned to the surface, they recalled the final battle of the war.\n\nBy careful strategy and manipulation, the coalition baited the Witch-King to make camp along a defensive crag overlooking a fathomless ocean trench, allowing our allies to pin the tyrant from above and below. Realizing the closed trap, the Witch-King swam forth and did battle, blasting soldiers with spell and blade in an attempt to break out, and yet despite the sheer destruction wrought upon our forces, the coalition's trap held. In the chaos overlooking the destined dark, a merfolk's brave coral spear, bleached like silver and guided by truth, struck past the Witch-King's abjuration barrier. Unleashing a terminal shriek, the very waters boiled with energy before a bright blue light flooded the battlefield. After the flash dissipated, the Witch-King's shocked corpse sank like a stone into the trench. Our aquamancers and enchanted soldiers recalled their merfolk allies practically flying through the seas with unbridled joy at the Witch-King's demise.\n\nThough dramatic, our soldiers' tale skipped the dull aftermath. The Witch-King's ascendant state shattered into irrelevance, the coalition formally dissolved and returned to their homes, and the remaining merfolk cities basked in celebrations for an entire moon cycle.\n\nWe join the tides in sighing with relief. Though it will be an arduous rebuilding process for the merfolk, they have not shunned from giving thanks to $COUNTRY$. Piece by piece, our merfolk allies delivered shares of the spoils taken from the remaining coalition funds and the Witch-King's treasury."
 merfolk_events.25.a:0 "Ashen skies, that was close."
 merfolk_events.26.t:0 "A Witch-King's Wrath"
 merfolk_events.26.d:0 "Storm clouds blot the horizon, air hisses like a viper's strike, and the sea boils red and black with malice. From the roiling tumult emerge the Witch-King's forces, each awash with arcane protections and terrible magical auras that frighten even our staunchest soldiers. Amid the storm above, a long and dour face materializes from the clouds. As it speaks, a booming voice thunders for miles.\n\n“Surface, keepers of knowledge and air, your sun-kissed days draw to a close. You, like so many before, dared defy my might. I accept your answer, and return with wrath;  my wrath, the wrath of the ocean itself. I deliver only what is just: your ships shall sink, your homes shall wash away, and all that touches your coast is mine to claim or destroy. Now die.”\n\nBeams of arcane ice and lightning rain down from on high. Our people scramble to hide from the torment, but it is no use when the Witch-King's forces rise from the shore and waterways, dragging them down into the dark depths. As torment descends upon our coastal people, the Witch-King laughs, reveling in our demise."

 merfolk_events.27.d:0 "After an arcane implosion rocked the merfolk tyrant's capital, 15 long years of grim prosperity came undone. Details conflicted on what exactly happened to the Witch-King: an ascension gone array, an inept arcane student, foul powers coming to collect, or the gods' fury. Whatever the case, our treasured partner was destroyed, leaving the ill peace broken like a diseased seashell.\n\nOur merchants' lucrative dealings collapsed along with the Witch-King's undersea magocratic nation. From the spell-scorched ashes arose entities reborn or forged from the societal collapse, and though the merfolk, now freed of their tyrant, seek contact just as capriciously as they always have, the pain and disdain in their eyes is undeniable. From merchants to diplomats, no merfolk welcomes our people's presence. Even along our sea lanes, their voices adrift on bright winds of change, the merfolk curse $COUNTRY$ for our cowardice and cooperation with their oppressor.\n\nWe might one day make amends, but for today and tomorrow, the merfolk loathe us and all we stood for...or rather, all we allowed to prosper."

A thousand days I've sailed past that spot, its rocky walls high as a fortress - a smuggler's den if I''ve ever laid eyes on one! But never has the shore wept with such melodious meters, aching of desire and sorrow, confusion and wonder. Amid the moonless waves, a flicker of firelight radiated above the rocks like a dying forge. I drifted right past that inland cove, but alas, by fate or caution, whatever was making those sea sights vanished: only a burning fire left on the shore remained.”\n\nAt first a tall tale, the sailor's story soon proved true. For the last few weeks, other travelers along [merfolk_abduction.GetName]'s shoreline have told similar accounts about the inlet's nighttime activities: strange crooning, warming fires, but an otherwise empty shore. As dread swells among the locals about nefarious powers at work, a local guard captain swears to get to the bottom of it."

Dragging myself along the rocks, I saw it-... saw a monstrous, vile merfolk charming a witless woman. When I confronted it, the creature bit me and knocked me out. After I awoke, all that remained was a trail leading inland. I was outplayed once, but I intend to see it skewered for its crimes, general.'\n\nThe general doesn't question the tale's veracity despite its flaws: why the merfolk did not kill him, why it dragged itself inland rather than out to sea, or why he hid the blunt bruise on the back of his skull. Instead, the general pouts, his displeasure hardened with bureaucratic indifference.\n\n'You've set [merfolk_abduction.GetName] alight with panic over your bungle on that beach. The people are practically tearing up their own beds to find it, and it's all your fault for raving about it for...pride? Recognition? It's like you're asking to be washed away with the tide.\n\n'But sir, I've always been a stalwart soldier.

 merfolk_events.32.d.2:0 "A mostly forgotten structure, the subterranean site was barred by wood and stone barriers to prevent trespassers...until today.\n\nA foreboding scene greets the arriving guards: the cistern's seals peeled away, grooves in the dirt hinting at a struggle, and droplets of blood trailing inside. Pressing into the structure's antechamber, the guards discover the missing citizen wounded and prone. Tugging on the first guard to reach her, she gestures further inside, trying her best to communicate via wordless sobs and trembling hand gestures. One of the guards notes the rudimentary signals as a sign language, but can only make out singular words:\n\n'Help. Hurting. Fish. Man. Hurting. Fish. Help. Fish.'\n\nThe patrol doubts their comprehension of the woman's soundless words, but before clarifying her message, a primordial shout seizes the guards' hearts, compelling action.\n\nRushing into the main chamber, the patrol catches two figures contesting a weapon caught between them. A merfolk, covered in bleeding wounds, tussles with none other than the local guard captain. In the chamber's deep shadows, the lengthy merfolk coils like a serpent, struggling to gain traction on the slick floor. The merfolk's eyes flicker between his attacker and the new arrivals, his dark irises swelling with desperation and uncertainty. He utters a string of merfolk words (indecipherable by present company), but the tone is undeniable: a plea.\n\nThe guard captain shoves the merfolk onto his back and screams like a nightmare, fitting the weapon into his bleeding grasp:\n\n'I'LL KILL YOU MYSELF IF YOU DON'T RUN THIS FREAK THROUGH!'"

The captain knocks one of the guards onto their back before raising his weapon high. In the shadows, he appears like a demon laboring to bring death. And then...he seizes. \n\nBlood pools over his shoulders as the merfolk, snaking behind him, manages to slash at the captain's neck. The captain sways, eyes wide before tumbling dead into the dirty cistern waters. Heaving, the guard recoils as his fellow sentries gather around the merfolk, weapons pointed. The biggest threat dealt with, the merfolk slinks into a pile, heaving and wounded.\n\nFootsteps splash along the cistern's shallow waters as the missing citizen limps inside, falling atop the merfolk and kissing him passionately. The two embrace, earning a moment of love and quiet between them. As the terror that grips [merfolk_abduction.GetName] fades into history, the tale of the mysterious cove earns a glimmer of truth.\n\nA merfolk and surface pair, so taken with the shore, found each other in a secret place. Despite hatred's fire and suspicion's deadly fever, they preserved, escaping those who would see their union as a threat to some precarious order.\n\nBut love, at least this once, won. The monster lay dead, the people reel from their actions over the last months, the merfolk become more than the other, and the cove gently thrums with music and fire just as it did. But rather than a ghostly unease, the calm nights flicker with wonder and hope. For along the shores of that inlet did the ocean find its curve."

By the time the captain tires from his assault, the cistern's murky waters flow red as wine. Chucking his weapon aside, the captain inhales sharply, nodding and thanking the men for their service.\n\nFootsteps splash along the cistern's shallow waters as the missing citizen limps inside, falling atop the merfolk and sobbing. She clutches him, but his lifeless body sits silent, unable to embrace her ever again. As the terror that grips [merfolk_abduction.GetName] fades into history, the tale of the mysterious cove warps into a sickly lie.\n\nA vile merfolk, wicked to its core, abducted a woman foolish enough to wander from her home. To right this wrong, a valiant guard captain heroically chased the creature into its lair before slaying it. The people responded with natural and measured actions - actions never to be questioned or examined.\n\nAnd so 'justice' won. The 'monster' lay dead, the people mull about absent introspection, the merfolk remain forever a monstrous other, and [merfolk_abduction.GetName] attracts a stream of hotshots and egotists hoping to earn bloody glory.

Proud and gentile, the envoys speak amicably of their mission, their journey ashore, and current events with a soft smile or disarming quip - what model guests.\n\nYet a whisper breaks out from among our counselors. Mage and water planetouched advisors note how taxing such a briny display is: Lifting a small pond to swim about in without fear of drying out is one thing, but to do so without rest for hours on end? They surely require respite. After a lone politician blunders into the subject, the merfolk delegation explains genially:\n\n“Our wards can keep us mobile and refreshed. It is but a small effort for our people's future cooperation."\n\nHow can $COUNTRY$ deepen relations with the merfolk if they struggle to survive amid our realm? Yes, the delegation stated it is of no consequence, but is that truth or timid politeness? As hosts, we must oblige our guests by providing palatable refreshments and comfortable environs, but we could also go above and beyond, renovating the capital with grand pools for merfolk habitation and stationing aquamancers with the delegation to maintain their wards, albeit at a great cost.

They then guided us into the heart of their watery nation, showcasing awesome reefs, dark depths, and gargantuan settlements brimming with merfolk. They granted us an audience with their grand councils, esteemed royals, and leading politicians, and while lodging in their seastone palaces, they ensured comforting amenities: dry and airy chambers, savory meals fusing sea and surface cuisine, and even a spell to enhance our swimming. All in all, it was a wholly successful exchange of pomp and circumstance.\n\n'Yet,' the diplomat slows, choosing his next words carefully, 'myself and several other envoys experienced...curious scenarios. At least one of their mercantile royals remarked on our plain attire, an ancient merfolk general toasted to our 'finless' forms, and a host of other odd remarks. Naturally,' the diplomat qualifies, 'we were more than gracious in the face of such comments. We attributed this to jovial jeers meant to deepen bonds - like siblings!'\n\nThe capital court mutters.
