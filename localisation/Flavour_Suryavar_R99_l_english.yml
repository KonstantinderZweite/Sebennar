 flavour_suryavar.1.d:0 "His Majesty [Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], sovereign of the Southern Reaches of Rahen, Custodian of the Sun Mountain has a reputation of a great ruler.\nAs befits a monarch of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] caliber and stature the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] was graced by Surael to be a parent of several capable children and many who show great promise as future rulers. As both the children themselves and our government officials are aware, however, only one can inherit and there is little in the way of consolation prizes. Our Viziers are adamant that it is now high time for [Root.Monarch.GetName] to name a favorite among the possible successors. This is unlikely to end the competition for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] favor but it will hopefully stop the worst succession struggles that might follow if our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] should meet [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] maker without having picked a clear successor."
