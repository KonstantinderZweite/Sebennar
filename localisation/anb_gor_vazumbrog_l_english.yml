 I14_a_hold_rebuilt_title:0 "A Hold Rebuilt"
 I14_a_hold_rebuilt_desc:0 "Destroyed almost 1000 years ago the fortress hold of Gor Vazumbrog was the first and main line of defence against the greentide for the Segbandal. They had held on for a very long time until the dragon known as the hunter of the deep had destroyed the hold and spread a noxious gas that permeated throughout the hold. While the gas seems to be gone now it is time to start rebuilding what once was"
 I14_a_small_problem_title:0 "A Small Problem"
 I14_a_small_problem_desc:0 "It appears that we were incorrect in our assumptions that the hold gas had been dealt with. As we moved properly into the third layer the fumes of the gas hit the dwarven settlers hard making reconstruction past this point impossible. There use to be proper ventilation down in the hold but without the repairs of hul jorkad we wont be getting anywhere anytime soon and without the knowledge of how to fix them then we definitely wont be able to even work the pipes that we do fix"
 I14_guarding_the_upper_levels_desc:0 "With the whole noxious gas issue it has been decided to do what we can with what we got. In the meantime while we work on our whole issue of not having a working lower layer it is time to ensure that we have the army to properly get the hold defended in the case of another orcish warband"
 I14_guarding_the_upper_levels_title:0 "Guarding the Upper Levels"
 I14_upper_layers_clear_title:0 "Upper Layers Clear"
 I14_upper_layers_clear_desc:0 "with the reclaimation of the holds it is time to start using our newfound knowledge to use and fixing up the hold. With the draining of the gas we will be able to finally start to dig deeper into our hold until the problem re-arises"
 I14_golems_found_in_the_lower_levels_title:0 "Golems Found in the Lower Levels!"
 I14_golems_found_in_the_lower_levels_desc:0 "with us being able to go to the fourth layer we have started to find some of the many vaults that our hold is most known for. What we didnt expect was to find another one of our holds relics, their titanium golems. They would easily be able to survive the smog well after their masters succumbed to it and as such will probably attack anyone on sight. We will need a proper force to remove these golems and continue downwards"
 I14_learning_about_golems_title:0 "Learning About Golems"
 I14_learning_about_golems_desc:0 "While we were fighting the golems it was asked by our mages to try and study the monsters. They weren't able to figure out much but were hoping with proper help from the closest hold to the once golem hold of Ovdal Asra, Khugdihr we will be able to make more golems. The way we do this does not matter as long as it gets done"
 I14_hitting_the_lower_levels_title:0 "Hitting the Lower Levels"
 I14_hitting_the_lower_levels_desc:0 "Now that the gas has been permenantly dealt with we can continue on our way to reclaiming the hold. The holds restoration will of course happen AFTER we deal with even more golems. Their insistence on pestering our progress makes it very difficult to get what it is that we are really after. The relics of Aul Dwarov. Once we can reopen the vaults maybe then we can make a name for ourselves again"
 I14_the_first_vaults_secured_title:0 "The First Vaults Secured"
 I14_the_first_vaults_secured_desc:0 "With the first set of vaults in our hands it is time for us to put our best minds to figuring out a way in. We will also need an army to protect the holds that we currently own as we dont want to overextend ourselves like we did in the third segbandal expidition. We will instead focus on having our armies complimented by golems that help support our armies and ensure that the mistakes of the past dont happen again"
 I14_the_key_to_the_vaults_desc:0 "It appears that there is no way into the vaults that we can find and instead we will be depending on getting the key from Amldihr. We can either try and diplomatically reaquire the key from them or we can own the hold itself and take it. It doesnt matter which way it happens we just need that key"
 I14_the_key_to_the_vaults_title:0 "The Key to the Vaults"
 I14_a_hold_restored_title:0 "A Hold Restored"
 I14_a_hold_restored_desc:0 "Every day the hold looks more and more like what the hold looked like in its golden days. With one major difference and that is its defensibility. While the past Gor Vazumbrog could defend itself for a thousand years under siege with the introduction of cannons that time has gone down considerably to maybe a year or so. In response to this we need to put our greatest minds to the task of building up the defenses of the hold and ensuring that no one can get in"
 I14_the_vaults_prepared_to_open_title:0 "The Vaults Prepared to Open"
 I14_the_vaults_prepared_to_open_desc:0 "Everything is set, the fortress is prepared for any invasion from inside or out, we have an army to hunt down anything that may have found a way inside of the vault, and finally we have alliances set up so that any drakes that escape our grasp can be hunted down by them instead. Now is the time to open the vaults and take our long awaited treasure"
 I14_rebuilding_the_warrior_monks_title:0 "Rebuilding the Warrior Monks"
 I14_rebuilding_the_warrior_monks_desc:0 "The warrior monks were one of the many titanium orders that made up the society of the titanium hold. We need to reimplement this order so that our people can feel secure again. The warrior monks were in charge of not only being a martial class within Gor Vazumbrog but they also protected many of the temples across the dwarovar as well as helped in the defense of many of the battles within the dwarovar. Not only will rebuilding this holy order be another step in rebuilding Gor Vazumbrog but it will also provide a large and well trained manpower pool to pull from in times of emergencies"
 I14_warrior_monks_resurging_title:0 "Warrior Monks Resurging"
 I14_warrior_monks_resurging_desc:0 "With the order refounded it is time to rebuild the infrastructure that they had defended. Building barracks for the newly integrated monks will provide the training they need to defend the temples and building churches across the dwarovar will also not only be a place for the monks to defend but will also serve as a place of worship for any dwarf in the serpentspine"
 I14_warrior_monks_places_of_worship_title:0 "Warrior Monks Places of Worship"
 I14_warrior_monks_places_of_worship_desc:0 "Ovdal Az An was the center of the dwarven pantheon until its fall by goblins. The warrior monks have suggested we liberate this hold and use it for our own needs as well as being a strong holy site that the warrior monks can train and protect for the citizens of the dwarovar"
 I14_warrior_monks_enemies_dealt_with_title:0 "Warrior Monks Enemies Dealt With"
 I14_warrior_monks_enemies_dealt_with_desc:0 "The fall of the segbandal had many, many, many reasons but one of them was definitely the raiding and pressures from the jade dwarves. Their 'jade empire' while impressive did a lot to drag resources into Gor Ozumbrog instead of Gor Vazumbrog. Not only that but the segbandal and the jade empire were rivals until the fall of both states. It is time to show them that we are now much more powerful than their empire was, even in its golden age"
 I14_finding_the_skycleaver_title:0 "Finding the Skycleaver"
 I14_finding_the_skycleaver_desc:0 "Skycleaver is probably the most important sword that was made in Gor Vazumbrog. Weilded by a legendary hunter by the name of Krummul Orcslayer who was the youngest to join the Dauvek Veker and had saved the dwarves from Hul Jorkad and even helped hunt the orcs in the suran. This sword is such an important part of the history of our hold and we believe that with all the work we have done to rebuild it into its former glory it is time to find its most legendary weapon"
 I14_producing_an_army_title:0 "Producing an Army"
 I14_producing_an_army_desc:0 "The armies of Gor Vazumbrog are needed to reclaim our portion of the dwarovar. To do this we need to pull from more than just the hold and instead from every cave and every rail settlement that we can and ensure that every dwarf is ready for battle."
 I14_learning_about_our_history_title:0 "Learning About Our History"
 I14_learning_about_our_history_desc:0 "Gor Vazumbrogs history is long and detailed. The portion of our history that we are looking for is about the titanium orders of Gor Vazumbrog. We currently know the names of the three largest orders, the craftsmen, the warrior monks, and the most important one the Dauvek Veker. So we will try to learn more about these orders so that we can reimplement them into todays state"
 I14_an_army_to_fight_the_drakes_title:0 "An Army to Fight the Drakes"
 I14_an_army_to_fight_the_drakes_desc:0 "We currently dont know what is inside of the vaults. This area was once owned by a dragon which is known to be able to shapeshift into anything so in its curiosity it may have found a way inside. If it did then we cant ignore the idea that they left behind a little present for us if we were to come back. We need to ensure that if there is a nest of drakes here we are well protected against it"
 I14_rebuilding_the_dauvek_veker_title:0 "Rebuilding the Dauvek Veker"
 I14_rebuilding_the_dauvek_veker_desc:0 "The Dauvek Veker was an elite group of monster hunters that gained a massive amount of notoriety as their order gained more and more influence and power. It became one of the most elite groups in the dwarovar with extremely difficult entering requirements as well as being a rather small group usually numbering a few thousand at most"
 I14_testing_the_dauvek_veker_title:0 "Testing the Dauvek Veker"
 I14_testing_the_dauvek_veker_desc:0 "While we have in name recreated the Dauvek Veker there is no proof of their exploits, no reason to join them except for the prestige of its past. We need them to battle dwarves and have them prove their mettle so that others may look to join in their footsteps"
 I14_dauvek_veker_victorious_title:0 "Dauvek Veker Victorious"
 I14_dauvek_veker_victorious_desc:0 "The Dauvek Veker performed better than expected against the dwarves, defeating them easily in battle leading us to think that perhaps its time to bring them up against a real enemy, but first we have to find a worthy enemy for them to fight"
 I14_dauvek_veker_fighting_ancient_enemies_title:0 "Dauvek Veker Fighting Ancient Enemies"
 I14_dauvek_veker_fighting_ancient_enemies_desc:0 "We have found a target. A very large camp of orcs has been found in the caverns near the woods. The Dauvek Veker have been notified and are on their way to the location to clear them out. Hopefully within the end of the day the orcs will be all cleared out and no longer an issue for us"
 I14_dauvek_veker_orcish_armies_removed_title:0 "Dauvek Veker Orcish Armies Removed"
 I14_dauvek_veker_orcish_armies_removed_desc:0 "The orcs proved to be of little issue to the Dauvek Veker and they had cleared them out with ease. The only issue being of course how many orcs there were but at the end of the day the orcish camp is cleared and the name of the Dauvek Veker only grows larger"
 I14_fortifying_the_caves_title:0 "Fortifying the Caves"
 I14_fortifying_the_caves_desc:0 "While it is well known how defensible the hold of Gor Vazumbrog not many know that it actually wasnt where the orcs were held back it was actually a well fortified location in the dwarovar rail that kept the orcs out of the middle dwarovar. We should emulate this with our own defenses outside of the hold"
 I14_alliances_to_help_hunt_the_drakes_title:0 "Alliances to Help Hunt the Drakes"
 I14_alliances_to_help_hunt_the_drakes_desc:0 "We are going to need alliances to ensure that if complications arise from us opening the vaults that we can depend on them to not betray us and attack us in our moment of weakness"
 I14_craftsmen_rebuilt_title:0 "Craftsmen Order Rebuilt"
 I14_craftsmen_rebuilt_desc:0 "The Craftsmen are one of the major titanium orders. While they werent really a military order as they didnt fight any battles they were in charge of two major roles. The first is of course producing the weapons that the dwarves use to battle their way through the dwarovar, the second is to make the runic protections for the golems. These runes make it so that the golems are resistant to magic as well as just generally more protected. It is time that our craftsmen learn these techniques so that our golems are even stronger than before"
 I14_craftsmen_learn_better_golem_techniques_title:0 "Craftsment Learn Better Golem Techniques"
 I14_craftsmen_learn_better_golem_techniques_desc:0 "Now that we have figured out the runes for our armies it is time for us to produce enough golems for any military venture in the dwarovar"
 I14_increasing_production_of_golems_title:0 "Increasing Production of Golems"
 I14_increasing_production_of_golems_desc:0 "Now that we have a large supply of golems its important that we can keep them functional and in order to do that we will build manufactories to ensure that spare golem parts are always prepared for the losses that they will take in the mountains"
 I14_golem_production_mastered_title:0 "Golem Production Mastered"
 I14_golem_production_mastered_desc:0 "Our golems are created for war and war alone. That was the mistake of the golem hold, to not ensure that all golems are able to be made for any fighting situation. Now each and every hold will have a mage tower for which they can control their own reserve of golems in defense of the hold. Not only that but there are also new weapons for our golems to use that have been updated for the current style of warfare"
 I14_hul_jorkad_reclaimed_title:0 "Hul Jorkad Reclaimed"
 I14_hul_jorkad_reclaimed_desc:0 "Hul Jorkad was the start of the fall of the dwarovar. We didnt take the threat seriously of an elf in our basement and the orcs proved to us the importance of hold security. But currently all of that is moot what we need are the pipes in the hold to start pumping the noxious gas out of our hold. Once that is fixed then maybe we can talk about the importance of such a hold"
 I14_hul_jorkad_expanded_title:0 "Hul Jorkad Expanded"
 I14_hul_jorkad_expanded_desc:0 "Hul Jorkad is basically the center of the dwarovar. The pipes allowing for ventilation and water distribution across the dwarovar and when it fell it was probably the worst hold to have fall first. But now it is back under our control and we can work to rebuild it as best as we can"
 I14_hul_jorkads_pipes_rebuilt_title:0 "Hul Jorkad's Pipes Rebuilt"
 I14_hul_jorkads_pipes_rebuilt_desc:0 "With the hold pushed down to the second level we can start rebuilding the pipes properly and ensure that we will no longer have any issues with the smog in our hold. We can of course continue to rebuild the lead hold but it is no longer a requirement."
 I14_the_many_holy_orders_of_gor_vazumbrog_title:0 "The Many Holy Orders of Gor Vazumbrog"
 I14_the_many_holy_orders_of_gor_vazumbrog_desc:0 "We will need to search the hall of the ancestors to figure out how each of the orders functioned in titanium society. The hall of the ancestors being the largest library should have all the information we need for how it worked before the fall of amldihr and then we will have to work through the stories to figure out how they would functin throughout the many years after the fall"
 I14_the_three_holy_orders_title:0 "The Three Holy Orders"
 I14_the_three_holy_orders_desc:0 "The orders of Gor Vazumbrog were extremely important in everyday society. The different orders all each focus on a different aspect of life within the hold and we should reimplemnt them. Now that we know how each of the orders functioned we just have to figure out how to implement them properly"
 I14_hunting_the_deep_crowes_title:0 "Hunting the Deep Crowes"
 I14_hunting_the_deep_crowes_desc:0 "The Deep Crowes are the beasts that made Krummul Orcslayer join the order. We will prove that we can follow in his footsteps by also clearing a deep crow nest. While it may not be as much of a show of force by bringing multiple hunters it will give us the experience we need to properly implement these hunts in the future with solo adventurers"
 I14_dauvek_veker_crowes_removed_title:0 "Dauvek Veker Crowes Removed"
 I14_dauvek_veker_crowes_removed_desc:0 "The battle was chaotic but also enlightening. The crowes were deadly in melee combat and taught the dwarves the importance of crossbows even when they are more professionalyl trained in melee combat. The crows would be devistating in melee but liked to stay above the dwarves so shooting them down became how they were dealt with before they could do too much damage. While many dwarves died it was a lesson won by the Dauvek Veker"
 I14_finding_a_nest_of_drakes_title:0 "Finding a Nest of Drakes"
 I14_finding_a_nest_of_drakes_desc:0 "Now it is time to find the last of the drakes that have been found in the hold. Normally the drakes would be left alone as they arent hurting anyone and honestly that portion of the hold wasnt super important but this is also a great oppertunity for the Dauvek Veker to practice against monsters that are significantly more powerful than them"
 I14_dauvek_drake_nest_cleared_title:0 "Dauvek Drake Nest Cleared"
 I14_dauvek_drake_nest_cleared_desc:0 "Finally after days of fighting all the drakes were dealt with. What was once thought to just be a single nest ended up being an entire small army of them. It was so bad the general army had to be called in as most of the Dauek Veker were killed in the initial charge. The remaining survivors will be great teachers for the next batch of the Dauvek Veker and while costly now will be a large boon for the order as a whole"
 I14_hehodovar_reclaimed_title:0 "Hehodovar Reclaimed"
 I14_hehodovar_reclaimed_desc:0 "Hehodovar is the first hold and the hold that all other holds were based upon. Their inhabitants were mostly known for making weird inventions and their mass suicide when they killed their own dwarves. The hold is creepy and dark in the time being but we need to find the records of how the pipes work so that we can save our hold"
 I14_building_up_an_administrative_center_title:0 "Building Up an Administrative Center"
 I14_building_up_an_administrative_center_desc:0 "Now that the immediate worries of the smog have been dealt with we can properly look into Hehodovar. While it is still creepy, the evidence of infighting and destroyed walls and caves can be found everywhere to remind those of the fall of the first hold.

Most of the vault stuff we find will be too dangerous to use, too high of a chance to backfire, or functionally useless currently. When we do find something it will be difficult to figure out how it works and then how to mass produce it. We believe it will take 20 years to find something then we can start mass production.

While this project is entirely artificer focused there is definitely a spectical to the tower in of itself. It is paraded around as if it is some kind of relic. The sounds are loud yet calming as it brings memories of raindrops falling on the mountainside ceiling for those that lived on the upper floors. Whether or not it will work properly is currently unknown but surely the artificers know what they are doing"

Maybe we just put them near the raw recruits and hope for the best that it targets the enemies instead of them?"

As we forced the changes to the relic so that it would fail we heard a dark ominous voice in the corner of our minds. Those that started working on it went out of comission for about a week but when they returned they returned with a fervor. Working on the relic day and night until every single one of them was ready to be activated. When we realized what was going on it was too late, far too late. The administration had already changed."

 flavor_gor_vazumbrog.35.d:0 "The preparations are set. The magnets ready and the cannons modified. The only thing really left to do is put it all together. While a strong magnet may not sound like much of a relic back 10k yaers ago perhaps they didnt quite have the cannon producing abilities that we have today and as such it was much more dangerous but now hopefully we can take good use of this knowledge"

 flavor_gor_vazumbrog.37.d:0 "The hum of the magnets are off. The projectile is awkward in the cannon. It appears that it has failed rather spetacularly. The cannons will still work without many changes but there is an increase chance of them breaking down periodically. This will probably be rather expensive to keep going but it may be worth it for the few cannons that do succeed in firing the shot"

 flavor_gor_vazumbrog.38.d:0 "The soft stone emitter is a neat little device that was originally created to make building the holds easier. It uses magic to turn the stone into soft stone, something easy to work with and tear down. During the times of aul dwarov though there was no real need for this as all their holds were expertly built and well created instead of the holds we have now which are mostly in disrepair. Sure a could of holds are caught up to their original glory but there is still a vast difference between the two. So at the time there was no need for such reckless devices but now that we are in a bit of a need for building up our holds the device has once again seemed useful, provided it does not turn our hold into mush of course"

 flavor_gor_vazumbrog.41.d:0 "It all happened so fast. The stone emitters turned on and all the stone started turning soft. The crowd was cheering and the miners were quick to work until they realized really quick that the stone was soft too far and too high. The cracks in the ceiling followed and then a massive slam as piece after piece of the upper layer falls down into the dwarven holds newest layer.

While dwarves are very good with tinkering these are a special issue as they are so small but also delicate.

These legs are working better than expected and the effectiveness is now clear to all. No longer will these dwarves be seen as a slow wall of spears and guns but now a true speedy military that can only be outran by centaurs or even the harpies."

It doesnt seem to be hindering our troops at the very least but for the most part it appears that the legs are nothing more than hunks of junk that were expensive to produce"

With luck this will drastically reduce the cost of maintaining the golems and at worst, eh, probably just make them a little more vulnerable. While the army may not be a fan of the golems being used less if it does fail the cost of the golems have never quite been popular"

Each one with the possibility of either making the golemancers jobs easier or giving them a nightmare of their work being less effective. But as the magics run through the golems and each one seems to get picked up with an ease not seen earlier there is a sigh of relief. There will be more golems to come in the future"

The rate is the same as usual but the golems are more jerky, they dont move quite right and its clear the relics have failed. The military will have to make do with worse support for the time being as this is fixed"

 flavor_gor_vazumbrog.62.d:0 "These needles were found in a hidden box in the vault. We decided to check them out and they were filled with dwarven blood? The experiment seems super old and we werent sure who would do such a thing but we also wanted to know what they did. We were able to trace the blood back to Gor Burad and we took samples of the dwarves there. Then we followed through with the modifications that seemed to have been made and injected it into a dying dwarf and to our suprise he jumped up and started fighting the doctors. This seems to be extremely potent but with a side effect of just charging at the enemy its clear why these werent used past testing"

 flavor_gor_vazumbrog.63.d:0 "While drugs in the military isnt unheard of its not exactly a pleasant idea for the troops.

In a way the soldiers are willing to fight but also they seem to be a bit too willing to fight whatever is infront of them. The doctors had to hide from them after injection and we are mostly trying to keep them on the move. Ideally we fight the enemy soon as that can direct them easier but we arent sure how long we can keep them distracted for."

 flavor_gor_vazumbrog.66.d:0 "These runic axes are yet another object with the strange runes that we cant really understand. The axes themselves however seem extremely powerful, through testing we have found the effective even against walls letting troops clear their own entranceways into castles and making sieges significantly faster. There is of course the slight downside that they may get a little too lost into battle and leave themselves open to being attacked but the effectiveness of breaking down walls is a little too tempting to not test these out in real battles"

 flavor_gor_vazumbrog.67.d:0 "The soldiers are estatic. Usually it isnt the battles that get soldiers killed but the sieges. Standing outside in the open getting shot at, sallies, and disease are all major factors for why sieges suck so much. With these axes there should be no problem at all for us getting through the walls and making the sieges go from year long affairs to hopefully done in a few months"

 flavor_gor_vazumbrog.69.d:0 "The axes dont seem to have their usual power, in fact they seem like everyday normal axes. Although there is a slight side effect of the soldiers seem sort of distant, like they are lost in some kind of trance. Whatever it is im sure some battlefield experience will fix it right up."
