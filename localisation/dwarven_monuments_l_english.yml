orlazam_food_silos_desc: "Orlazam's position as the premier Dwarven hold overlooking the rich and fertile Serpentsvale has led to it becoming a key location for the collection and distribution of food, especially for the army. The rail lines between Orlazam and Er-Natvir, the Railyard of the empire, are some of the fastest and highest quality rails in all of the Dwarovar, due to the importance of the Serpentsvale in supplying the army and the holds.

Hul-Jorkad was the first hold of the Dwarven Empire to fall to the orcs, and once it fell, the lack of water caused the fate of the majority of the holds--those that relied on Hul-Jorkad for water--to be all but sealed. It could reasonably be argued, as it has been by many dwarves following the fall, that had any hold, any hold at all besides Hul-Jorkad fallen to the invaders, that the Dwarven race may have been able to survive against the onslaught of orcs."

While initial prospecting and surveying operations indicated that large quantities of mithril were likely in the area, continued attacks by orcish rading parties and swarms of goblins forced the Quartz Dwarves to retreat back into their hold, at least for the time being."
