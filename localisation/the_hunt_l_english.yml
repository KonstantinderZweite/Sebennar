 #Aspects
 harpy_seek_powerful_egg_aspect:0 "Seek Powerful Egg"
 desc_harpy_seek_powerful_egg_aspect:0 "We are always on the lookout for promising eggs, their potential divined by our shamans and créche-matrons. By invoking our authority, we can earmark such valuable offspring for our court and train them to serve."
 harpy_fair_winds_aspect:0 "Invoke the Winds"
 desc_harpy_fair_winds_aspect:0 "For as long as we harpies have taken to the sky, learned shamans have buoyed our wings. With a great tailwind at our backs, we can strike hard and fast before enemies even know we have arrived."
 harpy_gain_siege_aspect:0 "Aerial Assault"
 desc_harpy_gain_siege_aspect:0 "“No wall has been built over which we cannot fly.”\n- company motto, 1st Ayarallen Aerotillery"
 
 harpy_move_pop_aspect:0 "Gather Breeding Mates"
 desc_harpy_move_pop_aspect:0 "The lesser matriarchs are always baying for good breeding stock, third or fourth concubines by which strong children may be sired. When such calls become acute, we skim the finest male tenth or so off the top of our subject villages and carry them to our nests."
 harpy_raid_neighbour_aspect:0 "Winged Raid"
 desc_harpy_raid_neighbour_aspect:0 "When fifth daughters grow restless and their wrists go unadorned, we know it is time for another raid. Let us take to the sky and tear the wealth of Halann from its skin!"
 
 harpy_entice_immigration_aspect:0 "Breeding Incentives"
 desc_harpy_entice_immigration_aspect:0 "The lesser matriarchs are always lobbying for good breeding stock, third or fourth concubines by which strong children may be sired. When compatible males prove scarce, it is a simple matter of generous dowries and tax exemptions to those families whose menfolk answer the call."
 harpy_the_odd_hunt_aspect:0 "The Odd Hunt"
 desc_harpy_the_odd_hunt_aspect:0 "Groundfolk dismiss our Hunt as a mere exercise in predation, and for too long we believed them. But to live is to hunt - for meaning, for knowledge, for new experiences. ‘Odd Hunt’ was once a term of derision, coined by raider matriarchs who did not understand the drive to discover. Now it is a term of honour. In this era when harpies may travel foreign lands unaccosted, the hunt is redefined as the search for harpy identity itself."
 
 #Events
 the_hunt_events.1.t:0 "Fair Winds"
 the_hunt_events.1.d:0 "We beat our wings and draw great circles in the air. Our song mingles with the wind, and the breath of Halann passes through our lungs. A moment passes and we know the wind, commanding it as we would a wing or a limb. A moment more and… we are the wind."
 the_hunt_events.1.a:0 "Fly swift, my daughters!"
 the_hunt_events.1.b:0 "On second thought…"
 the_hunt_events.2.t:0 "Gather Potential Breeding Mates"
 the_hunt_events.2.d:0 "By tradition, a husband levy takes around one tenth of a village’s male population. Our criteria are simple; the mates must be physically robust, and are preferably sourced from large families. The latter is proof of familial fertility, promising for a concubine, not to mention that the fourth of five brothers rarely bankrupts the farm by his absence."
 the_hunt_events.2.a:0 "Take them from [harpy_pop1.GetName]."
 the_hunt_events.2.b:0 "Take them from [harpy_pop2.GetName]."
 the_hunt_events.2.c:0 "Take them from [harpy_pop3.GetName]."
 the_hunt_events.2.dd:0 "Take them from [harpy_pop4.GetName]."
 the_hunt_events.2.e:0 "Take them from [harpy_pop5.GetName]."
 the_hunt_events.2.f:0 "No, I don’t like any of them…"
 the_hunt_events.3.t:0 "A Winged Raid"
 the_hunt_events.3.d:0 "The ancient cycle repeats itself - our younger daughters, eager for fame and fortune, chafe to be unleashed upon a complacent Halann. From the sky, we will scope out their finest treasures and carry them home to adorn our nests. Let none live without fearing the harpies!"
 the_hunt_events.3.a:0 "Raid the §Y[harpy_raid1.GetAreaName]§! area"
 the_hunt_events.3.b:0 "Raid the §Y[harpy_raid2.GetAreaName]§! area"

 the_hunt_events.3.e:0 "None of their stuff looked any good anyway…"
 the_hunt_events.300.t:0 "Helpless at Halting Harpy Hunts"
 the_hunt_events.301.d:0 "Alarm!\n\nHarpy flocks have descended upon §r[harpy_raid1.GetAreaName]§, carrying off their body weight in fine goods and leaving only destruction in their wake. Before our levies could even muster, the sky-devils were away again. If we want such raids to stop, we must end them at their source."
 the_hunt_events.302.d:0 "Alarm!\n\nHarpy flocks have descended upon §r[harpy_raid2.GetAreaName]§, carrying off their body weight in fine goods and leaving only destruction in their wake. Before our levies could even muster, the sky-devils were away again. If we want such raids to stop, we must end them at their source."

Before our levies could even muster, the sky-devils were away again. If we want such raids to stop, we must end them at their source."
 the_hunt_events.300.a:0 "Curses!"

  the_hunt_events.4.t:0 "Acquiring the Egg"
 the_hunt_events.4.d:0 "Having identified and adopted an egg of unusual promise, we must decide how to shape this promising life."
 the_hunt_events.4.a:0 "Once the egg hatches, provide the harpy with a well-rounded education."
 the_hunt_events.4.b:0 "Once the egg hatches, enroll the harpy as an apprentice mage."
 the_hunt_events.4.bx:0 "§gOnce the egg hatches, enroll the harpy as an apprentice mage.. (unavailable)§!"
 the_hunt_events.4.c:0 "We are not yet ready to make this decision."
 the_hunt_events.7.t:0 "Hatching the Egg"
 the_hunt_events.7.d:0 "Twenty-five years ago, we earmarked a promising young life for the service of our court. Though still barely grown, this harpy has proven..."
 the_hunt_events.7.a:0 "... a talented merchant!"
 the_hunt_events.7.b:0 "... a skilled diplomat!"
 the_hunt_events.7.c:0 "... a zealous missionary!"
 the_hunt_events.7.dd:0 "... a canny advisor!"
 the_hunt_events.7.e:0 "... a capable general!"
 the_hunt_events.7.f:0 "... a powerful war wizard!"
 the_hunt_events.8.t:0 "Encourage Migration"
 the_hunt_events.8.d:0 "Harpy concubinage is no longer the dreaded tax it once was. Now it is a chance for advancement, a way for unattached third and fourth peasant sons to spare their parents yet another bride price and win themselves a life of relative comfort. When the harems lie empty, we issue a tax amnesty or a new civic dowry, open to all in a given region capable of siring healthy harpy young. Then we simply sit back and select from the many prospective concubines who answer the call."
 the_hunt_events.8.a:0 "Take them from [harpy_pop1.GetName]"
 the_hunt_events.8.b:0 "Take them from [harpy_pop2.GetName]"

 the_hunt_events.8.f:0 "No, I don’t like any of them..."
 the_hunt_events.9.t:0 "The Odd Hunt"
 the_hunt_events.9.d:0 "Restless daughters who once might have taken to raiding are drawn now by the promises of an increasingly networked world. We fliers have always travelled, but the many highways and byways of modern trade now entice harpies to destinations all across Halann, each harpy on an Odd Hunt of their own."
 the_hunt_events.9.a:0 "Gather every word, every whisper, every whim."
 the_hunt_events.9.b:0 "Never mind, this isn't a good idea right now."

 #Decisions
 
 the_hunt_myna_decision_title:0 "Adopt Doctrine of the Myna"
 the_hunt_myna_decision_desc:0 "Our shamans debated what posture the Hunt should take towards the religious practices of subject peoples within the territory of the flock, and have at last reached a decision. The guiding example of the myna bird shall be followed. Common throughout Bulwar and Rahen, small myna birds nest communaly, and form flocks with a variety of other birds. What others may believe shall be of no concern to us, and the Hunt is ours alone."
 the_hunt_falcon_decision_title:0 "Adopt Doctrine of the Falcon"
 the_hunt_falcon_decision_desc:0 "Our shamans debated what posture the Hunt should take towards the religious practices of subject peoples within the territory of the flock, and have at last reached a decision. The guiding example of the falcon shall be followed. A keen-eyed bird of prey, the falcon searches both the sky and the land as it hunts. In recognition of the primacy of the Hunt, it shall be spread to heathens. Though they may still revere their own gods, in culture and philosophy they shall join the Hunt and empower it."
