 bjarnrik_defeat_obrtrol_title:0 "End the Troll Menace!"
 bjarnrik_defeat_obrtrol_desc:0 "Long have the hated Trolls dwelt in the rocky crags of the Dalrfjall, hunting and enslaving our people with almost no fear of impunity. Not since the days of Bera have the Trolls been driven back; the mountains are the border between civilization and barbarity. Far worse than just the violence and fear they bring, the vile Trolls steal our people and force them to toil in the pits and mines of the mountains until their death. This has gone on for far too long: let us unite the clans, assemble the armies, and end their villainy once and for all!"
 bjarnrik_purge_the_dalrfjall_trolls_title:0 "Slay the Troll Masters!"
 bjarnrik_purge_the_dalrfjall_trolls_desc:0 "It is clear what must be done: Obrtrol's dark shadow across our land must be erased forevermore! Our enslaved brethren shall inherit the land the once toiled, and whatever troll that remains will know to respect and fear us for our mercy."
 bjarnrik_great_troll_hunt_title:0 "The Great Troll Hunt"
 bjarnrik_great_troll_hunt_desc:0 "The borderlands of Sidaett have always been sparsely populated, bordering the troll-infested taiga of Far Gerudia. The cousins of the Dalrfjall trolls, the ones of the forest are no less savage and less deserving of our justice. After our great victory over Obrtrol our warriors are warriors are itching for another challenge: let us send them into the Gullmork to fight some more Trolls!"
 bjarnrik_golden_forest_title:0 "Explore the Golden Forest"
 bjarnrik_golden_forest_desc:0 "Gullmork, the 'Golden Forest' as the Cannorians would say, stretches as a blanket of wooded wilderness before the endless barren wastes of Far Gerudia. An ancient tale from our ancestors tells us that somewhere in these woods lies gold; although it is a cautionary tale against rash decisions, the Skalds tell us that now the tale is true. More than just gold however, the woods are full of valuable furs. While we search for the much-coveted gold, it would be wise to populate these land permanently and establish trade connections with the rest of Gerudia."
 bjarnrik_bear_over_murtrhol_title:0 "The Bear Over Murtrhol"
 bjarnrik_bear_over_murtrhol_desc:0 "Obrtrol lies defeated, our victory secure. The trolls have sent us an offer, promising us fealty to the Konungr if they are allowed a degree of autonomy in the Dalrfjall mountains. Of course, by that they mean that they wish to continue to enslave our people in their mines. But their offer is enticing: the trolls make formidable warriors, and their mines profitable. What if we were to accept? Let us convince our liberated brethren that they are safer now under our rule, and have nothing to fear from their Troll masters."
 bjarnrik_dalrfjall_prison_mines_title:0 "Dalrfjall Prison Mines"
 bjarnrik_dalrfjall_prison_mines_desc:0 "There is a tradition among the Fjord Trolls to enslave captured humans for work in their mines, dating back to some ancient decree from the fabled Frost Giants. We could utilize this tradition, our Troll subjects in the Dalrfjall mountains will happily accept some more laborers, and without doubt will not host any questions on our intentions. Our criminals and prisoners will serve their sentence in the mines, far outpaying the cost of hosting them, and without risk of escaping under the watchful Trolls. Those that fulfill their sentence will have earned their freedom."
 bjarnrik_jotunsglotta_title:0 "Jotunsglotta Fortifications"
 bjarnrik_jotunsglotta_desc:0 "The Frozen Pass is much coveted as the sea connection between the Giant's Grave Sea, the Dragon Coast, and beyond. Although we control many of the small isles that dot the pass, Serpentgard and its protector Celmaldor have long kept us from imposing tolls. The Jotunsglotta are still of use to us however: they will make a prime defensive location to stop invaders from crossing the pass into Gerudia. And they will also be a prime staging ground for forces."
 bjarnrik_poke_the_eyegard_title:0 "Poke the Eyegard"
 bjarnrik_poke_the_eyegard_desc:0 "Serpentgard has been a thorn in our side for far too long: long have they resisted the Crown of Bera. The early kingdom of Bjarnrík and the as-of-yet disunited peoples of the Serpentshead were embattled over control over the Frozen Pass isles in the late 10th century. While our armies besieged their fortresses, their elite warriors the "Sea-Serpents" snuck by and struck at our stronghold of Fuglborg. Our city sacked, Bjarnrík's armies withdrew to deal with this invasion of their homeland only to find the Sea-Serpents had disappeared into the marsh as quickly as they appeared. Now, the petty nobles of Serpentgard pride themselves on their treacherous victory. Let us avenge Fuglborg and control both sides of the Frozen Pass!"
 bjarnrik_celmaldor_title:0 "Principality of Celmaldor"
 bjarnrik_celmaldor_desc:0 "Sitting under the maw of the Serpentshead, the elves of Celmaldor have contested our control over the Alenic Reach and the trade that flows through it. Arriving shortly after the start of the 11th century, the elves quickly brought an end to our ambitions in the Reach, integrating and subjugating their neighbours through diplomacy and underhanded coercion. Our old enemies of Serpentgard saw their southern borderlands of Deland and Mawdock seized, and soon their lords bowed before the Celmaldorian Princes. They have no intention of releasing their grip on Reachmen politics and stopping our expansion: with their subjugation under the Crown of Bera the region will be ours to dominate!"
 bjarnrik_consult_with_skalds_title:0 "Consult with the Skalds"
 bjarnrik_consult_with_skalds_desc:0 "Despite our victory against the Trolls, our realm is under ever increasing threat every day. There are reports of Gray Orcs ravaging the eastern Reach, the Gawedi preparing hosts and missives for influence in the Reach, and as always the Reachmen themselves resist all fiercely. One might have the wisdom and strength to defeat one, but so many? We must consult with the Skalds for guidance, for only they know what may come next, and how we may persevere."
 bjarnrik_reunion_of_the_bears_title:0 "Reunion of the Bears"
 bjarnrik_reunion_of_the_bears_desc:0 "It is clear that our Konungdómr is weaker with its subjects boasting lavish privileges. All throughout Cannor feudal kingdoms have been dragged down by disloyal and ambitious lords, we must be better than them. Bjarnrík may strive to adopt customs of the southerners, but that does not mean we will adopt their failures: Bjarnrík must prove herself a superior fusion of our Gerudian roots and modern Cannorian practices. The Jarls of Revrhavn and Sidaett have long abused their positions and power: they must be made to kneel."
 bjarnrik_stormfleet_title:0 "Construct the Stormfleet"
 bjarnrik_stormfleet_desc:0 "The churning, frigid Sea of Storms is well known for its violent storms and monstrous waves. Only the foolhardy would brave to sail these seas were it not for its connection to the ports of the south. The Stormfleet was assembled to protect Bjarnrík's merchant marine from both the dangers of the sea and the enemies it carries."
 bjarnrik_westward_voyages_title:0 "Westward Voyages"
 bjarnrik_westward_voyages_desc:0 "Long have tales spoken of lands seldom visited, shrouded past the glaciated expanses of Far Gerudia and the ever breaking waves of the Sea of Storms. Few openly admit it, but these tales are often viewed as being but fairy tales by most. But not Freidar, known as the Mad Mariner. A survivor of a particularly disastrous shipwreck in the Sea of Storms, Freidar cobbled together a raft on a barren rock known on no maps. This experience must have been traumatic beyond comprehension, but Freidar does not fear the sea anymore. Freidar has been known as the 'Mad Mariner' for ranting and crying at all hours about the lands to the west, full of trees and gold. The council cannot recommend him enough as the leader for a grand expedition across the seas to the west!"
 bjarnrik_new_skaldskolan_temple_title:0 "Renovation of Skaldol"
 bjarnrik_new_skaldskolan_temple_desc:0 "Skaldol is the beating heart of the Skaldhyrric Faith, a temple-city nestled in the craggy foothills of the Titan's Rest Mountains. It is a site of great importance, for it is said that the recitation of 'The Dragon and the Skald' by the Master Skald-Priest keeps the dragon Elkaesal asleep, and the endless winter at bay. However, Skaldol is only a hamlet compared to the greater cities of Gerudia and lands beyond the Giant's Grave Sea. As the protector of our faith, it is our duty to renovate Skaldol into a position of glory that it deserves."
 bjarnrik_siddaet_fur_amber_title:0 "Sidaetti Furs and Amber"
 bjarnrik_siddaet_fur_amber_desc:0 "The forests of Gerudia teem with rich game fur, perfect for keeping oneself warm during winter and for enriching your pocket trading with the southerners. Clan Sidaett holds many of these lands, although in the extreme far north it is difficult enough even to survive let alone hunt for profit. Funding should be provided for enriching Sidaett by providing food and essentials for them to allow the province to focus on producing furs and the rare amber of Vargrhol."
 bjarnrik_fiorgam_title:0 "Fiorgam"
 bjarnrik_fiorgam_desc:0 "The tales were true! Freidar the Mad Mariner has found a land across the seas which he has named 'Fiorgam', an obvious misspelling of 'Fjord' and the Skald knows what 'gam' means. Reminiscent of home, the island is covered in forested steep fjords. This island should be claimed for Bjarnrík as a staging point for control of this new land."
 bjarnrik_stalwart_outpost_title:0 "A Stalwart Outpost"
 bjarnrik_stalwart_outpost_desc:0 "The shores of this new land are strange indeed, from crimson-tinged swamps to this - a massive glacier perched atop a massive cliff. This frozen land is different than Far Gerudia, for it is almost completely devoid of life. The snow and ice itself seems cursed, as if the land were still under Elkaesal's spell of winter. Still, our explorers have found curious artifacts buried underneath the ice: we must explore further!"
 bjarnrik_frozen_anomalies_title:0 "Frozen Anomalies"
 bjarnrik_frozen_anomalies_desc:0 "Underneath the ice of the Dalairey Wastes are ancient elven artifacts, and sometimes even ruins. They fetch a hefty price in Cannor, but also offer great insight into matters both arcane and scientific. A permanent center of research should be established to further understand these relics and what exactly had happened here."
 bjarnrik_prospect_for_copper_title:0 "Copper Prospecting"
 bjarnrik_prospect_for_copper_desc:0 "Professors from the Geological Institute of the Dalr have sent expeditions to map the geological topography and bedrock of Gerudia, and have some discoveries that may interest the Konungr. A representative from the Institute has arrived and has presented thee with cuprite and chalcopyrite, copper ores, from the Dalrfjall mountains. The Institute has requested funding to construct a mine and foundry in Brutnord to extract and process the copper, promising a generous cut of the pay for the crown."
 bjarnrik_prospect_for_gold_title:0 "Gold Exploration"
 bjarnrik_prospect_for_gold_desc:0 "Glodborg, a small town in the Titan's Rest Mountains, is named after an old legend of the first settlers finding gold nuggets under the fjord bay. Unfortunately for them they did not realize that gold could be found in much higher quantities as both small grains hidden in the sediment, and in veins within quartz-rich granite higher in the mountains. The Geological Institute of the Dalr has requested funding for establishing a series of river sluices and materials for mining of the quartz-rich granite."
 bjarnrik_ambercoast_title:0 "Ambrströnd"
 bjarnrik_ambercoast_desc:0 "Freidar also discovered pine-covered land to the north of Fiorgam not unlike the northern expanses of Gerudia, named Ambrströnd after the curious amber and sap found on the trees. This land, unlike Fiorgam, is populated by icy blue people with penetrating yellow eyes that watch us from the forests. Despite these Teira, the land remains fairly empty and no less habitable than the woods of Vargrhol. Ambrströnd should be colonized for our people to relieve the burgeoning population and shortages at home, and to gain access to the resources hidden under these wintry woods."
 bjarnrik_frondvagr_title:0 "Frondvagr"
 bjarnrik_frondvagr_desc:0 "The gateway to inland Dalaire because of the mighty Hjora estuary, Frondvagr has attracted the attention of many wishful colonists. Our colony in Dalaire wishes to secure it for the Konungr, and swiftly follow forth with settling the upper river. Just north from Frondvagr the Teira dwell in their largest settlement, aptly named Teirainé in Elven. They will make a fine addition to our colony."
 bjarnrik_mineral_exploration_title:0 "Dalairey Mineralogy"
 bjarnrik_mineral_exploration_desc:0 "While Dalaire is certainly full of goods like furs and lumber, there is more to the land that is not visible at first glance. Pioneers and explorers into the woods have found curious shining stones on the surface, often found among strange boulders sitting on the surface. Ores such as iron, copper, and gold, silver hide beneath our very feet! These discoveries have attracted the attention of intellectuals from the homeland: let us make sure they have plenty to examine!"
 bjarnrik_geological_institute_of_the_dalr_title:0 "Dalr Geologic Institute"
 bjarnrik_geological_institute_of_the_dalr_desc:0 "The recent discoveries and exploration of mineral wealth in the Dalaire region has ignited a fierce interest in all things geological. How were these ore formations created, why are the continents the way they are, why is there a giant ring of cliffs in the Ruin? And most importantly of all, where can we find more ores and minerals, using scientific knowledge? These scholars have petitioned the Konungr for funding to create an institution for which they can host experiments, expeditions, and teach their new skills. Of these new scholars are dwarven experts who bring knowledge from their holds and their families."
 bjarnrik_prospect_for_iron_title:0 "Prospect for Iron"
 bjarnrik_prospect_for_iron_desc:0 "Kaldrland has always had been a barren land, bereft of resources other than wild beasts and plagued by strange toxic red water that seeps from the ground. This has always been a mystery for ages: the Geological Institute of the Dalr has proposed that this red water is acid mine drainage from pyrite and other iron ores under the earth. They ask for funding to test this hypothesis, and promise to provide the crown with a generous portion of the profits."
 bjarnrik_prospect_for_coal_title:0 "Lignite Exploration"
 bjarnrik_prospect_for_coal_desc:0 "The Geological Institute of the Dalr has produced many successful theories and has gained a greater understanding of geologic patterns. That is, the ones that have presented to the Konungr. In recent years coal has become a subject of much interest in Cannor for its value as fuel for furnaces; the Institute has produced a theory that there may be more coal than is immediately visible in Gerudia. Coal may be the product of ancient organic matter condensed under great pressure. The Institute proposes that there may be coal nearby the hold of Fuglborg, a leftover of the great flood that drowned the Frost Giants of old."
 bjarnrik_codd_wars_title:0 "Codd Wars"
 bjarnrik_codd_wars_desc:0 "Many small rocky islands dot the Sea of Storms, offering refuge from the dangerous waves if not for the Gnomes who squat on them. Stubbornly clinging to their old glory of the Gnomish Hierarchy they deny us access to their islands, and claim fishing rights over the Sea of Storms! We must seize the islands from them, for the cod!"
 bjarnrik_oddansbayer_kingdom_title:0 "Reclaim Drekiríki"
 bjarnrik_oddansbayer_kingdom_desc:0 "One of the many colonies of the Gerudians during the Era of Black Ice, Drekiríki was established on the ruins of Gnomish Oddansbay. Founded in 803, the reaver kingdom operated as a loose confederacy of allied ship captains and warlords who aimed to settle the rest of the Dragon Coast. However, they met fierce resistance from the Kobolds who had already massacred the Gnomes, and when Castan Ebonfrost’s wars began few went to Drekiríki. The kingdom was destroyed by 901 when the settlement at Oddansbay was finally overrun by the Kobolds. This land is our ancestral right, the Kobolds who deny it must be driven back to their caves!"
 bjarnrik_reveria_title:0 "Kingdom of Reveria"
 bjarnrik_reveria_desc:0 "Reveria was one of the first successful kingdoms formed by reavers in the Era of Black Ice shortly before the establishment of the Derannic kingdom. Reveria proved an able rival to Deranne after pacifying the Gnome and Halfling natives, and to this day it has persevered against Gawed, Lorent, and others that would take them down. Although it has retained some of its Gerudian heritage unlike Deranne and Pearlsedge, it has begun to lose its identity to Gawedi, Halfling, and Gnomish influences and has converted to the Regent Court. Reveria also sees itself as superior to its homeland, defying our role as mother bear to the Gerudian family. Our cousins must be returned to the Gerudian family before they are lost forever!"
 bjarnrik_derhildes_realm_title:0 "Derhilde's Realm"
 bjarnrik_derhildes_realm_desc:0 "Derhilde Reaverqueen settled the prosperous kingdom of Deranne in 861 following a Lorentish civil war in the 850s. The Reaverqueen waged war against the weakened Lorentish kingdom from 863 to 869 and achieved dominance over Lencenor, although true control over much of the region remained in the hands of the Lorentish nobility. Deranne itself and the ruined realm of Darom were rebuilt by the new Gerudian kingdom, but as throughout the centuries the conquerors merged with the conquered, abandoning their Gerudian heritage for fine vintage wines and foppish chivalric jousts. There may be still an ember of their lost pride; Derhilde's realm must be retaken!"
 bjarnrik_embrace_cannorian_practices_title:0 "Adopt Fine Cannorian Arts"
 bjarnrik_embrace_cannorian_practices_desc:0 "Since the inception of Bjarnrík the Konungdómr has been the premier adopter of Cannorian practices, lifting it from our barbaric past into the modern world as a nation none of whom the southerners can dare scoff at. We have always been selective of what truly counts as innovation, for they are just as prone to create foolishness than brilliance. However, the recent developments of arts, sciences and other studies have aroused some interest among our upper classes. They wish for portraits to adorn their manors and dusty manuscripts of half-forgotten elvish poems to scour through; at the very least their distraction with novelties will give them less to time to question our ruling. Let us reach out to the center of these arts and study their ways."
 bjarnrik_port_of_konungrhavn_title:0 "Port of Konungrhavn"
 bjarnrik_port_of_konungrhavn_desc:0 "At the mouth of the Rafn river, Konungrhavn has always been the staple port of Bjarnrík. Trade on the Giant's Grave Sea has shuffled from east to west and back, rarely moving past the Dragon Coast because of the dangerous seas and the those borne upon them. A new era dawns upon us, for now the ships enter from and depart to a vast land beyond the seas to the west. Konungrhavn has become the prime port for Aelantiran trade: we must make sure to reinforce this boon by expanding our colonial interests beyond the seas."
 bjarnrik_blue_alenic_coast_title:0 "Blue Alenic Coast"
 bjarnrik_blue_alenic_coast_desc:0 "The Alenic Reach is a coastline of tiny city-states that barely reach beyond their city gates, yet each have the valiant but foolish defiance of a cat pretending to be a lion. In ages past these people were once similar to ours, before the Gawedi and the Alenics gave them their namesake. Some still worship the Skaldhyrric Faith, although they are outnumbered by the Regent Court. Without the leadership of Celmaldor, their defenses should be sundered. It is time to end their resistance!"
 bjarnrik_alenic_loyalty_title:0 "Fealty of the Reachmen"
 bjarnrik_alenic_loyalty_desc:0 "The fickle lords and wily merchants of the Alenic Reach are many and possess countless tiny and inefficient feudal holdings. It would be foolish to think we could juggle the loyalties of these hordes, but they must be brought to heel. Those that are deemed the most loyal, or those treacherous that can be placated with a boon, will be elevated beyond their petty status and named dukes of their lands which answer to the Konungr."
 bjarnrik_fortify_against_gawed_title:0 "Fortify the Alenic Reach"
 bjarnrik_fortify_against_gawed_desc:0 "The Reachmen defended their lands against all through their cooperation more so than fortresses. Gone are the days that this regime can be exploited, for with every passing year the importance of a standing army increases and that of a noble's retinue diminishes. The Gawedi look to the Alenic Reach and beyond with hungry eyes, thinking Bjarnrík an easy target. A series of fortifications must be constructed across the Reach for the day that war will emerge between the Bear and the Eagle."
 bjarnrik_the_bear_and_the_eagle_title:0 "The Bear and the Eagle"
 bjarnrik_the_bear_and_the_eagle_desc:0 "It is unavoidable: one day war must be waged against Gawed for supremacy over the Alenic Reach. They may be strong, they may be numerous, but they lack what we are strong in: our men and women are together in shared purpose and spirit! Our armies and fleets will triumph over the Eagle, for while they may soar in the sky today, wounded wings are no match for the strength of the mother Bear!"
 bjarnrik_titan_and_dragon_title:0 "Titans and Dragons"
 bjarnrik_titan_and_dragon_desc:0 "The gateway to Olavlund is studded with innumerable fjords. These are the Titan's Rest Mountains, the ancient battleground between Frost Giants and Dragons in days long gone. The Skalds of Skaldol recite this ancient tales in hope that they may keep the dragon Elkaesal the White aslumber. A Gerudia united will be one that may once more be a threat on the world stage."
 bjarnik_olavlund_united_title:0 "Olavlund United!"
 bjarnik_olavlund_united_desc:0 "The Olavish, our wayward brothers, are separated into squabbling clans. Urviksten clings to the glory of their Ebonfrost heritage, although that glory may not be enough to stop the Graytide. All of Olavlund must be secured before it is lost forever!"
 bjarnrik_thaw_the_maw_title:0 "Thaw the Maw"
 bjarnrik_thaw_the_maw_desc:0 "Was once Vrorenmarch, now are Gray Orcs, the farthest eastern bay of the Giant's Grave Sea has always been a threat to Gerudia. More ambitious, and bloodthirsty, than the old Vrorenmarchers content to watch their halls, the Gray Orcs have incessantly assaulted Olavlund. Even worse, they have threatened our kin of the Skaldhyrric Faith in the eastern Alenic Reach states of Eskerborg, Cedevik, and Rivsby. Bjarnrík cannot abide with this blatant attack on our homeland and people; let us drive them out of Castan Ebonfrost's old fortress of Vrorenborg!"
 bjarnrik_rid_the_east_of_orcs_title:0 "End the Graytide"
 bjarnrik_rid_the_east_of_orcs_desc:0 "The eastern Alenic Reach has been plagued by the Graytide, Gray Orcs who pretend that they are civilized compared to their green cousins. While they accepted surrender from the conquered Reachmen, they have oppressed them not unlike the tyranny of the Trolls over Murtrhol. Forced marriages of the upper classes with Orcs, and the institutional disregard of human subjects who do not follow their Chained God Dookan, are only the tamest horror stories that reach us from their shores. We must not stop at Vrorenborg, we must end their tyranny forever!"
 bjarnrik_end_graytide_tt:0 "[Root.GetName] gains a permanent claim on §YGray Orc§! and §YWhite Reachmen§! provinces in §YAlenic Reach§! Region.\nCulture in §YGray Orc§! provinces in §YAlenic Reach§! Region will become §YWhite Reachmen§!.\nThe religion in §YGray Orc§! provinces in §YAlenic Reach§! Region changes to §YSkaldhyrric Faith§!."
 bjarnrik_northern_empire_title:0 "The Northern Empire"
 bjarnrik_northern_empire_desc:0 "The shores of the Giant's Grave Sea all bow before the Crown of Bera: our homeland of Gerudia unified, the squabbling disunited Alenic Reach united, the Gray Orcs of old Vrorenmarch. Now even the Eagle of Gawed lies cleaved by the claws of the Bear. Bjarnrík is clearly the true master of the north: we must cement our status by eliminating the threat of Gawed, making us the true Northern Empire!"
 bjarnrik_industrial_revolution_title:0 "Industrial Revolution"
 bjarnrik_industrial_revolution_desc:0 "Fire and smoke dominate the land in the 18th century. While the southerners spin their cloth with machines, ours will be vast foundries of iron and steel powered by the combustion of coal. Gerudia and the northern lands contain ample quantities of iron, coal, and other minerals that fuel our industrial might. Rivers and fjords provide efficient transportation, and power waterwheels with their churning strength. Bjarnrík will be a shining beacon of progress, the standard of industrial might! "
 bjarnik_skalds_and_artificers_title:0 "Skalds and Artificers"
 bjarnik_skalds_and_artificers_desc:0 "The expansion of coal driven industrialization has marked changes in our society. The traditional Skalds view the Artificers with suspicion, while the Artificers themselves wish to be granted further free reign to experiment. Both offer contrasting visions for the future of our country, which group will guide us?"
 bjarnrik_kingdom_of_pearls_title:0 "Kingdom of Pearls"
 bjarnrik_kingdom_of_pearls_desc:0 "Henrik Divenscourge founded the kingdom of Pearlsedge in 879 by conquering half of the old Tretunic Kingdom. The major powers who kept the peace, Lorent and Dameria, could could hardly stop a Reaver and his army whilst they fight among themselves over dynastic troubles. Henrik used this region as a staging point for further raids along the Divenhal Sea, and with their maritime traditions they soon discovered countless pearls among the shellfish on the sea bed. Over the years they have become more like their Damerian neighbours than their ancestors, although they retain some of their Skaldhyrric traditions of Skalds in the worship of Munas Moonsinger. Henrik Divenscourge's kingdom gives us claim more than equal to the feudal lords of the Dameshead, for we are the true heirs to the Reavers of old!"
 bjarnrik_jewel_of_anbennar_title:0 "Jewel of Anbennar"
 bjarnrik_jewel_of_anbennar_desc:0 "The epitome of the wealth, power, and stagnation of the south, Anbenncóst was once settled by our peoples in the Era of Black Ice. This shining city so grand, full of riches and splendor, is also filled with even more squalor, filth, and poverty that follow a hand-in-hand with the backward feudal practices of the south. Anbenncóst and the isle of Damesear are the apple of the world's eye; who is to say that it cannot be ours?"
 bjarnrik_skaldhyrric_league_title:0 "Skaldhyrric League"
 bjarnrik_skaldhyrric_league_desc:0 "In the 17th century the world was beset by war between those of the Regent Court, Corinites, and the Ravelian Faith. Despite the instability in its realm, Gawed still greedily coveted the Alenic Reach and other realms that Bjarnrík had held. The Skaldhyrric faith centralized and reformed in this time, partially to stop conversions to these new faiths, and partially to create patriotic fervor in the kingdom in its struggles against Gawed. The Skaldhyrric League was founded by the Konungr and the united Skalds of Gerudia and the newly created temples in the Alenic Reach, where all the regions of the kingdom worked together in efficient cooperation to stop the advance of their enemies."
 bjarnrik_tretun_title:0 "Tretunic Claims"
 bjarnrik_tretun_desc:0 "The descendants of Henrik Divenscourge, the Pearlman and the 'of Pearlsedge' married into and inherited Tretun. In ancient days Tretun was a powerful kingdom on the western Dameshead, but has since fallen into obscurity, now only a border county that has been inherited countless times between dynasties. The newly re-established Gerudian rule over Pearlsedge gives us some legitimacy as rulers over Tretun, no less than the others who hand it around as a gift. Let us secure the county and entrench our position in the Dameshead."
